However, little work has been done to verify these models, especially in the area of measuring the quality of their predictions for network performance and the grade of service experienced by a customer. In this paper, we summarize the previous work in this area, highlight some of the difficulties in effectively verifying these models, and suggest methods by which source rate models for VBR video might be more effectively verified in the future. In addition to studying the problem of model verification, a new model is proposed. Using this model, a video sequence is characterized by four parameters. As in previous cases, the number of bits generated by the coder for a sequence of video frames is modelled. The new model differs from previous models in that this sequence is not Markovian.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4856358","displayDocTitle":"A new statistical model for traffic generated by VBR coders for television on the broadband ISDN","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new statistical model for traffic generated by VBR coders for television on the broadband ISDN","sourcePdf":"00340193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070537S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"54","articleId":"340193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":340195,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The median is obtained by first sorting input sequences and then selecting identified order according to the number of inputs. To reach the goal of high-speed data sorting, an optimized delete-and-insert algorithm is derived and then mapped onto shiftable content-addressable memory architecture. The complete design can be decomposed into a set of processor elements, where each processor element consists of two basic cells-sort-cell and compare-cell. Thus the design becomes very regular. More specifically any specified order can be obtained within one cycle and a high-speed clock rate can be achieved. A prototype chip for 64 samples based on this architecture has been implemented and tested. Results show that a clock rate up to 50 MHz can be achieved using a 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS double metal technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.340196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/7967/00340196.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.340196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed median filter designs using shiftable content-addressable memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340196/","displayDocTitle":"High-speed median filter designs using shiftable content-addressable memory","volume":"4","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4856361","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed median filter designs using shiftable content-addressable memory","sourcePdf":"00340196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028736S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"21","articleId":"340196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":340198,"authors":[{"name":"Yuk-Hee Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yuk-Hee Chan","id":"37289428700"},{"name":"Lap-Pui Chau","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Lap-Pui Chau","id":"37276379500"},{"name":"Wan-Chi Siu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wan-Chi Siu","id":"37270783500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"340198","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Filters","Equations","Signal processing algorithms","Computational complexity","Discrete transforms","Image converters","Digital signal processing","Digital images","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","recursive filters","filtering theory","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transform","recursive filter","digital signal processing","DCT"]}],"abstract":"We generalize a formulation for converting a length-2/sup n/ discrete cosine transform into n groups of equations, then apply a novel technique for its implementation.

Dual 8-kilobyte instruction and data caches coupled to a high performance 32/64-b system bus and separate execution units (float, integer, loadstore, and system units) result in peak instruction rates of three instructions per clock cycle. Low-power design techniques are used throughout the entire design, including dynamically powered down execution units. Typical power dissipation is kept under 2.2 W at 80 MHz. Three distinct levels of software-programmable, static, low-power operation-for system power management are offered, resulting in standby power dissipation from 2 mW to 350 mW. CPU to bus clock ratios of 1/spl times/, 2/spl times/, 3/spl times/, and 4/spl times/ are implemented to allow control of system power while maintaining processor performance.

In this paper, the implementation of a 200 MHz 13.3 mm/sup 2/ 8/spl times/8 2-D DCT macrocell capable of HDTV rates, based on a direct realization of the DCT, and using distributed arithmetic is presented. The macrocell, fabricated using 0.8 /spl mu/m base-rule CMOS technology and 0.5 /spl mu/m MOSFET's, performs the DCT processing with 1 sample-(pixel)-per-clock throughput. The fast speed and small area are achieved by a novel sense-amplifying pipeline flip-flop (SA-F/F) circuit technique in combination with nMOS differential logic. The SA-F/F, a class of delay flip-flops, can be used as a differential synchronous sense-amplifier, and can amplify dual-rail inputs with swings lower than 100 mV. A 1.6 ns 20 bit carry skip adder used in the DCT macrocell, which was designed by the same scheme, is also described. The adder is 50% faster and 30% smaller than a conventional CMOS carry look ahead adder, which reduces the macrocell size by 15% compared to a conventional CMOS implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.340421","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"1482","endPage":"1490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7973/00340421.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.340421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 200 MHz 13 mm/sup 2/ 2-D DCT macrocell using sense-amplifying pipeline flip-flop scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Macrocell networks","Adders","CMOS technology","Flip-flops","Image recognition","Data compression","HDTV","Arithmetic","CMOS image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","digital arithmetic","pipeline arithmetic","data compression","cellular arrays","flip-flops","CMOS logic circuits","digital signal processing chips","video coding","image processing equipment","high definition television","adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D DCT macrocell","sense-amplifying flip-flop scheme","pipeline flip-flop scheme","two-dimensional DCT","discrete cosine transform","image data compression","image data decompression","HDTV rates","direct realization","distributed arithmetic","CMOS technology","nMOS differential logic","delay flip-flops","differential synchronous sense-amplifier","carry skip adder","200 MHz","0.8 micron","0.5 micron","1.6 ns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"A 200 MHz 13 mm/sup 2/ 2-D DCT macrocell using sense-amplifying pipeline flip-flop scheme","volume":"29","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4854340","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340421/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 200 MHz 13 mm/sup 2/ 2-D DCT macrocell using sense-amplifying pipeline flip-flop scheme","sourcePdf":"00340421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047211S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"108","articleId":"340421","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340422,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

Instead of a phase-locked loop having a voltage-controlled oscillator, these circuits implement a delay-locked loop, thereby achieving low jitter and reduced sensitivity to noise on the substrate and the power supply rails. Differential signals are employed both in signal paths and in control paths, further decreasing noise sensitivity and simultaneously allowing operation from low voltage supplies. An unorthodox voltage controlled phase shifter, operating on the principle of quadrature mixing, yields a circuit with unlimited delay range (modulo 2/spl pi/ radians). Minor loops, enclosed within the overall loop feedback path, perform active duty cycle correction. Measured results show peak-to-peak jitter of 140 ps on the internal clock signal, and 250 ps on the external data pins, sufficiently small to allow 500 Megabyte/s transfer rates at the I/O interface.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.340422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.340422","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7973/00340422.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2.5 V CMOS delay-locked loop for 18 Mbit, 500 megabyte/s DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"A 2.5 V CMOS delay-locked loop for 18 Mbit, 500 megabyte/s DRAM","volume":"29","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4854341","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2.5 V CMOS delay-locked loop for 18 Mbit, 500 megabyte/s DRAM","sourcePdf":"00340422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05292S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"141","articleId":"340422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":340423,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.H.

The driver and receiver are realized in a standard 0.8 /spl mu/m digital CMOS process which makes integration with a DSP possible. The driver is a current steering transistor combined with a small quiescent current source. The modulation current is 60 mA which allows a 155 Mb/s optical data-rate. The receiver is a three-stage transimpedance amplifier followed by a signal converter which provides digital output signal levels. The three-stage configuration makes possible the realization of a high transimpedance (150 k/spl Omega/), necessary to obtain a high sensitivity, combined with a high bandwidth. The achieved optical data-rate is 240 Mb/s for 1 /spl mu/A input modulation currents. This results in a transimpedance bandwidth of 18 THz/spl Omega/, which is one order of magnitude higher than recently published circuits. The speed performance of the total link is limited by the optical time-constant of the LED, leading to a 155 Mb/s optical link, designed for use in four-fiber interboard connections in 622 Mb/s B-ISDN systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.340430","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"1552","endPage":"1559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7973/00340430.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.340430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS 18 THz/spl Omega/ 248 Mb/s transimpedance amplifier and 155 Mb/s LED-driver for low cost optical fiber links","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Optical modulation","Optical sensors","Optical amplifiers","Light emitting diodes","Driver circuits","Stimulated emission","Bandwidth","Costs","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical receivers","optical transmitters","optical fibre communication","digital communication","driver circuits","wideband amplifiers","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","CMOS digital integrated circuits","light emitting diodes","B-ISDN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS transimpedance amplifier","LED-driver","low cost optical fiber links","CMOS optical fiber link","PIN receiver","digital CMOS process","current steering transistor","quiescent current source","signal converter","three-stage configuration","four-fiber interboard connections","B-ISDN systems","240 Mbit/s","155 Mbit/s","0.8 micron","60 mA","1 muA","622 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS 18 THz/spl Omega/ 248 Mb/s transimpedance amplifier and 155 Mb/s LED-driver for low cost optical fiber links","volume":"29","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4854349","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340430/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS 18 THz/spl Omega/ 248 Mb/s transimpedance amplifier and 155 Mb/s LED-driver for low cost optical fiber links","sourcePdf":"00340430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062884S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"81","articleId":"340430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340431,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In our model the received signal at a given cell site is the sum of the signals transmitted from within that cell plus a factor /spl alpha/ (0/spl les//spl alpha//spl les/1) times the sum of the signals transmitted from the adjacent cells plus ambient Gaussian noise. Although this simple model is scarcely realistic, it nevertheless has enough meat so that the results yield considerable insight into the workings of real systems. We consider both a one dimensional linear cellular array and the familiar two-dimensional hexagonal cellular pattern. The discrete-time channel is memoryless. We assume that N contiguous cells have active transmitters in the one-dimensional case, and that N/sup 2/ contiguous cells have active transmitters in the two-dimensional case. There are K transmitters per cell. Most of our results are obtained for the limiting case as N/spl rarr//spl infin/. The results include the following. (1) We define C/sub N/,C/spl circ//sub N/ as the largest achievable rate per transmitter in the usual Shannon-theoretic sense in the one- and two-dimensional cases, respectively (assuming that all signals are jointly decoded). We find expressions for limN/spl rarr//spl infin/C/sub N/ and limN/spl rarr//spl infin/C/spl circ//sub N/. (2) As the interference parameter /spl alpha/ increases from 0, C/sub N/ and C/spl circ//sub N/ increase or decrease according to whether the signal-to-noise ratio is less than or greater than unity. (3) Optimal performance is attainable using TDMA within the cell, but using TDMA for adjacent cells is distinctly suboptimal. (4) We suggest a scheme which does not require joint decoding of all the users, and is, in many cases, close to optimal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340450/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","volume":"40","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4882588","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Shannon-theoretic approach to a Gaussian cellular multiple-access channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shannon-theoretic approach to a Gaussian cellular multiple-access channel","sourcePdf":"00340450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042566S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"528","articleId":"340450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":340451,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Convergence rates are given for an increasing vector dimension and/or an increasing training set size. In particular, the following results are shown for memoryless real-valued sources with bounded support at transmission rate R. (1) If a vector quantizer with fixed dimension k is designed to minimize the empirical mean-square error (MSE) with respect to m training vectors, then its MSE for the true source converges in expectation and almost surely to the minimum possible MSE as O(/spl radic/(log m/m)). (2) The MSE of an optimal k-dimensional vector quantizer for the true source converges, as the dimension grows, to the distortion-rate function D(R) as O(/spl radic/(log k/k)).

The optimized TCQ coder can achieve essentially the same performance as Ayanoglu and Gray's (1987) unconstrained trellis coding optimized for the binary symmetric channel, but with a much lower implementation complexity for transmission rates above 1 b/sample. In most cases, the optimized TCQ coder also provides larger signal-to-noise ratio than Farvardin and Vaishampayan's (1991) channel-optimized vector quantization. Algorithms are developed for the joint design of trellis-coded quantization/modulation (TCQ/TCM). The jointly designed TCQ/TCM system outperforms the straightforward cascade of separately designed TCQ and TCM systems. The improvement is most significant at low channel signal-to-noise ratio. For a first-order Gauss-Markov source, the predictive TCQ/TCM performance can exceed that of optimum pulse amplitude modulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.340455","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"1792","endPage":"1802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7974/00340455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.340455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis-coded quantization designed for noisy channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Additive white noise","Signal to noise ratio","Algorithm design and analysis","Gaussian noise","AWGN","Channel coding","Distortion measurement","Euclidean distance","Vector quantization","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis coded modulation","Markov processes","Gaussian channels","white noise","Gaussian noise","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis-coded quantization","noisy channels","white gaussian channel","memoryless sources","binary symmetric channel","optimized TCQ coder","performance","implementation complexity","transmission rates","signal-to-noise ratio","vector quantization","algorithms","TCM","trellis-coded modulation","TCQ/TCM system","first-order Gauss-Markov source","pulse amplitude modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Trellis-coded quantization designed for noisy channels","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4882593","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340455/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis-coded quantization designed for noisy channels","sourcePdf":"00340455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041619S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"74","articleId":"340455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340456,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Quan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Fu-Quan Wang","id":"37349119400"},{"name":"Daniel J.

Several versions of the algorithm can be obtained by choosing certain parameters and selecting a resynchronization scheme. These can be categorized as block decoding or continuous decoding, depending on the resynchronization scheme. Block decoding is guaranteed to resynchronize at the beginning of each block, but suffers some rate loss when the block length is relatively short. The performance of a typical block decoding scheme is analyzed, and we show that significant coding gains over Viterbi decoding can be achieved with much less computational effort. A resynchronization scheme is proposed for continuous sequential decoding. It is shown by analysis and simulation that continuous sequential decoding using this scheme has a high probability of resynchronizing successfully. This new resynchronization scheme solves the rate loss problem resulting from block decoding. The channel cutoff rate, demodulator quantization, and the tail's influence on performance are also discussed. Although this paper considers only the decoding of trellis codes, the algorithm can also be applied to the decoding of convolutional codes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.340456","startPage":"1803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7974/00340456.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.340456","endPage":"1817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Erasure-free sequential decoding of trellis codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Erasure-free sequential decoding of trellis codes","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4882594","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Erasure-free sequential decoding of trellis codes","sourcePdf":"00340456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044216S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","articleId":"340456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":340458,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

As a consequence, if s denotes the maximal size of an error, then in some cases the alphabet size of the generating code can be s+1 instead of 2/spl middot/s+1.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.340459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.340459","startPage":"1841","endPage":"1856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7974/00340459.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of fixed-length insertion/deletion correcting runlength-limited codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Construction of fixed-length insertion/deletion correcting runlength-limited codes","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4882597","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of fixed-length insertion/deletion correcting runlength-limited codes","sourcePdf":"00340459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026185S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","articleId":"340459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":340461,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

First, an upper bound is derived for the average rth-power distortion of channel optimized k-dimensional vector quantization at transmission rate R on a binary symmetric channel with bit error probability /spl epsiv/. The upper bound asymptotically equals 2/sup -rRg(/spl epsiv/,k,r/). where k/(k +r) [1 - log/sub 2/(l +2/spl radic/(/spl epsiv/(1-/spl epsiv/))] /spl les/g(/spl epsiv/,k,r)/spl les/1) for all /spl epsiv//spl ges/0, lim/sub /spl epsiv//spl rarr/0/g(/spl epsiv/,k,r)=1, and lim/sub k/spl rarr//spl infin//g(/spl epsiv/,k,r)=1. Numerical computations of g(/spl epsiv/,k,r) are also given. This result is analogous to Zador's (1982) asymptotic distortion rate of 2/sup -rR/ for quantization on noiseless channels. Next, using a random coding argument on nonredundant index assignments, a useful upper bound is derived in terms of point density functions, on the minimum mean squared error of high resolution, regular, vector quantizers in the presence of channel noise. The formula provides an accurate approximation to the distortion of a noisy channel quantizer whose codebook is arbitrarily ordered. Finally, it is shown that the minimum mean squared distortion of a regular, noisy channel VQ with a randomized nonredundant index assignment, is, in probability, asymptotically bounded away from zero.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.340467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7974/00340467.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.340467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974","startPage":"1926","endPage":"1938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic bounds on optimal noisy channel quantization via random coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic bounds on optimal noisy channel quantization via random coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340467/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4882605","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic bounds on optimal noisy channel quantization via random coding","sourcePdf":"00340467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077099S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","articleId":"340467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":340468,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, the problem is reformulated in terms of the optimal mapping from the unit interval with Lebesgue measure that would induce the desired reproduction probability density. This results in optimality conditions that are \"random relatives\" of the known Lloyd (1982) optimality conditions for deterministic quantizers. The validity of the mapping approach is assured by fundamental isomorphism theorems for measure spaces. We show that for the squared error distortion, the optimal reproduction random variable is purely discrete at supercritical distortion (where the Shannon (1948) lower bound is not tight). The Gaussian source is thus the only source that produces continuous reproduction variables for the entire range of positive rate. To analyze the evolution of the optimal reproduction distribution, we use the mapping formulation and establish an analogy to statistical mechanics. The solutions are given by the distribution at isothermal statistical equilibrium, and are parameterized by the temperature in direct correspondence to the parametric solution of the variational equations in rate-distortion theory. The analysis of an annealing process shows how the number of \"symbols\" grows as the system undergoes phase transitions. Thus, an algorithm based on the mapping approach often needs but a few variables to find the exact solution, while the Blahut (1972) algorithm would only approach it at the limit of infinite resolution. Finally, a quick \"deterministic annealing\" algorithm to generate the rate-distortion curve is suggested. The resulting curve is exact as long as continuous phase transitions in the process are accurately followed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7974/00340468.pdf","startPage":"1939","endPage":"1952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.340468","doi":"10.1109/18.340468","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340468","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rate-distortion","Distortion measurement","Annealing","Density measurement","Extraterrestrial measurements","Random variables","Isothermal processes","Temperature distribution","Equations","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate distortion theory","probability","variational techniques","Gaussian processes","quantisation (signal)","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal mapping","rate distortion theory","Lebesgue measure","reproduction probability density","Lloyd optimality conditions","deterministic quantizers","isomorphism theorems","coding theorems","squared error distortion","optimal reproduction random variable","Shannon lower bound","Gaussian source","continuous reproduction variables","optimal reproduction distribution","statistical mechanics analogy","isothermal statistical equilibrium","variational equations","annealing process","phase transitions","algorithm","Blahut algorithm","infinite resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"A mapping approach to rate-distortion computation and analysis","accessionNumber":"4882606","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mapping approach to rate-distortion computation and analysis","sourcePdf":"00340468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073208S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"80","articleId":"340468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340469,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It is assumed that the encoder knows both the true channel and the decoding metric. The lower bound on the highest achievable rate found by Csiszar and Korner (1981) and by Hui (1983) for DMC's, hereafter denoted C/sub LM/, is shown to bear some interesting information-theoretic meanings. The bound C/sub LM/ turns out to be the highest achievable rate in the random coding sense, namely, the random coding capacity for mismatched decoding. It is also demonstrated that the /spl epsiv/-capacity associated with mismatched decoding cannot exceed C/sub LM/. New bounds and some properties of C/sub LM/ are established and used to find relations to the generalized mutual information and to the generalized cutoff rate. The expression for C/sub LM/ is extended to a certain class of memoryless channels with continuous input and output alphabets, and is used to calculate C/sub LM/ explicitly for several examples of theoretical and practical interest. Finally, it is demonstrated that in contrast to the classical matched decoding case, here, under the mismatched decoding regime, the highest achievable rate depends on whether the performance criterion is the bit error rate or the message error probability and whether the coding strategy is deterministic or randomized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.340469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7974/00340469.pdf","startPage":"1953","endPage":"1967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.340469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On information rates for mismatched decoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"On information rates for mismatched decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340469/","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4882607","volume":"40","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On information rates for mismatched decoders","sourcePdf":"00340469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047499S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"253","articleId":"340469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":340470,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A class of block codes called module-phase codes is described. The algebraic framework used for describing these codes relies on elements from module theory which are discussed along with a method for constructing such codes for noncoherent detection. It is shown that differential encoding may be viewed as a specific code from a particular class of module-phase codes. Two classes of codes that achieve significant coding gain with respect to coherent detection of uncoded MPSK are presented. In the first class of module-phase codes, the coding gain is achieved at the expense of bandwidth expansion. In the second class, however, the coding gain is achieved at the expense of signal constellation expansion without expanding bandwidth. Finally, an integrated demodulation/decoding technique based on a modification of information set decoding is presented. It Is shown that this reduced-complexity, suboptimal decoding strategy performs nearly as well as maximum-likelihood decoding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.340470","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"1968","endPage":"1984","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7974/00340470.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.340470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M-ary phase coding for the noncoherent AWGN channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["AWGN channels","Maximum likelihood decoding","Phase detection","Bandwidth","Block codes","Constellation diagram","Modulation coding","Maximum likelihood detection","Demodulation","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation coding","channel coding","phase shift keying","demodulation","white noise","Gaussian channels","Gaussian noise","block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncoherent AWGN channel","coded M-ary phase-shift keying","MPSK","M-ary phase coding","noncoherent detection","block code","module-phase codes","module theory","differential encoding","coding gain","uncoded MPSK","bandwidth expansion","signal constellation expansion","integrated demodulation/decoding technique","information set decoding","reduced complexity suboptimal decoding","maximum-likelihood decoding","channel coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"M-ary phase coding for the noncoherent AWGN channel","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4882608","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340470/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M-ary phase coding for the noncoherent AWGN channel","sourcePdf":"00340470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049972S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"47","articleId":"340470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":340472,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

A useful sequential test which we term the MSPRT is studied in this paper. The test is shown to be a generalization of the sequential probability ratio test. Under Bayesian assumptions, it is argued that the MSPRT approximates the much more complicated optimal test when error probabilities are small and expected stopping times are large. Bounds on error probabilities are derived, and asymptotic expressions for the stopping time and error probabilities are given. A design procedure is presented for determining the parameters of the MSPRT. Two examples involving Gaussian densities are included, and comparisons are made between simulation results and asymptotic expressions. Comparisons with Bayesian fixed sample size tests are also made, and it is found that the MSPRT requires two to three times fewer samples on average.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.340472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7974/00340472.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.340472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974","startPage":"1994","endPage":"2007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sequential procedure for multihypothesis testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A sequential procedure for multihypothesis testing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340472/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4882610","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sequential procedure for multihypothesis testing","sourcePdf":"00340472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048097S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"171","articleId":"340472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":340474,"authors":[{"name":"T.

As a corollary, it is shown that the Shannon lower bound is asymptotically tight for norm-based distortions, when the source vector has a finite differential entropy and a finite /spl alpha/ th moment for some /spl alpha/>0, with respect to the given norm. Moreover, we derive a theorem of Linkov (1965) on the asymptotic tightness of the Shannon lower bound for general difference distortion measures with more relaxed conditions on the source density.

The noise process of the channel is generated according to the contagion model of G. Polya (1923); our motivation is the empirical observation of Stapper et al. (1980) that defects in semiconductor memories are well described by distributions derived from Polya's urn scheme. The resulting channel is stationary but not ergodic, and it has many interesting properties. We first derive a maximum likelihood (ML) decoding algorithm for the channel; it turns out that ML decoding is equivalent to decoding a received vector onto either the closest codeword or the codeword that is farthest away, depending on whether an \"apparent epidemic\" has occurred. We next show that the Polya-contagion channel is an \"averaged\" channel in the sense of Ahlswede (1968) and others and that its capacity is zero. Finally, we consider a finite-memory version of he Polya-contagion model; this channel is (unlike the original) ergodic with a nonzero capacity that increases with increasing memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.340476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7974/00340476.pdf","startPage":"2035","endPage":"2041","doi":"10.1109/18.340476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A communication channel modeled on contagion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"A communication channel modeled on contagion","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4882614","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340476/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A communication channel modeled on contagion","sourcePdf":"00340476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028219S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"49","articleId":"340476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":340479,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The high-temperature anneal results are shown to be relevant to understanding defect creation in zone-melt-recrystallized silicon on insulator materials. We observe the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of trap-assisted hole transfer between two different oxygen vacancy-type defects (E'/sub /spl delta///spl rarr/3 E'/sub /spl gamma// precursor) in hole injected thermal SiO/sub 2/ films. Upon annealing the hole injected Si/SiO/sub 2/ structures at room temperature, the E'/sub /spl delta// center transfers its hole to a previously neutral oxygen vacancy (O/sub 3//spl equiv/Si-Si/spl equiv/O/sub 3/) site forming an E'/sub /spl gamma// center. This process, also monitored electrically, shows a concomitant increase in the border-trap density that mimics the growth kinetics of the transfer-activated E'/sub /spl gamma// centers. This suggests that both effects are correlated and that some of the transfer-created E'/sub /spl gamma// centers are the entities responsible for the border traps in these devices. One implication of these results is that delayed defect growth processes can occur via slow trap-assisted hole motion in SiO/sub 2/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340513/","volume":"41","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4871540","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Microscopic nature of border traps in MOS oxides","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microscopic nature of border traps in MOS oxides","sourcePdf":"00340513.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068296S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"114","articleId":"340513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340514,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

In this regime, the excess base current depends on the particular charge-trapping properties of the oxide that covers the emitter-base junction. The device response is dose-rate-, irradiation-bias-, and technology-dependent in this regime. However, once a critical amount of charge has accumulated in the oxide, the excess base current saturates at a value that is independent of how the charge accumulated. This saturated excess base current depends on the device layout, bulk lifetime in the base region, and the measurement bias. In addition to providing important insight into the physics of bipolar-transistor total-dose response, these results have significant circuit-level implications. For example, in some circuits, the transistor gain that corresponds to the saturated excess base current is sufficient to allow reliable circuit operation. For cases in which the saturated value of current gain is acceptable, and where other circuit elements permit such over-testing, this can greatly simplify hardness assurance for space applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.340518","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340518.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340518","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"1864","endPage":"1870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounding the total-dose response of modern bipolar transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Bounding the total-dose response of modern bipolar transistors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340518/","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871545","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounding the total-dose response of modern bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"00340518.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037027S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"73","articleId":"340518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":340519,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

For O-V irradiation at /spl sim/25/spl deg/C, the net trapped-positive-charge density (N/sub ox/) inferred from midgap C-V shifts is /spl sim/25-40% greater for low-dose-rate (<10 rad(SiO/sub 2/)/s) than for high-dose-rate (>100 rad(SiO/sub 2/)/s) exposure. Device modeling shows that such a difference in screen-oxide N/sub ox/ is enough to account for the enhanced low-rate gain degradation often observed in bipolar devices, due to the /spl sim/exp(N/sub ox//sup 2/) dependence of the excess base current. At the higher rates, TSC measurements reveal a /spl sim/10% decrease in trapped-hole density over low rates. Also, at high rates, up to /spl sim/2.5-times as many trapped holes are compensated by electrons in border traps than at low rates for these devices and irradiation conditions. Both the reduction in trapped-hole density and increased charge compensation reduce the high-rate midgap shift. A physical model is developed which suggests that both effects are caused by time-dependent space charge in the bulk of these soft oxides associated with slowly transporting and/or metastably trapped holes (e.g. in E/sub /spl delta//' centers). On the basis of this model, bipolar transistors and screen-oxide capacitors were irradiated at 60/spl deg/C at 200 rad(SiO/sub 2/)/s in a successful effort to match low-rate damage. These surprising results provide insight into enhanced low-rate bipolar gain degradation and suggest potentially promising new approaches to bipolar and BiCMOS hardness assurance for space applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.340519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340519.pdf","startPage":"1871","endPage":"1883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical mechanisms contributing to enhanced bipolar gain degradation at low dose rates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Physical mechanisms contributing to enhanced bipolar gain degradation at low dose rates","volume":"41","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871546","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340519/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical mechanisms contributing to enhanced bipolar gain degradation at low dose rates","sourcePdf":"00340519.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071085S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"224","articleId":"340519","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":340527,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The temperature dependence of the mobility was obtained after irradiation and annealing to 550/spl deg/C for 30 minutes. The maximum value of the mobility, /spl mu//sub max/, with respect to temperature was obtained as a function of fluence. For samples which have been irradiated and then annealed, /spl mu//sub max/ goes through a maximum at a fluence of 10/sup 13/ cm/sup -2/ and is 10% higher than in the unirradiated samples. At higher fluences, the mobility degrades. We attribute the increase in mobility at lower fluences to a radiation induced order effect. The disappearance of the deep level EL12 could be associated with this effect. At higher fluences where the mobility degrades, we observe by photoluminescence spectroscopy, the gallium vacancy, a point defect introduced by the irradiation, and the transfer of the silicon atom from the gallium site to the arsenic site. This suggests that growth of the gallium vacancy or the silicon at the arsenic site can be associated with mobility degradation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340527.pdf","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.340527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mobility study of the radiation induced order effect in gallium arsenide","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Degradation","Annealing","Gallium arsenide","Inductors","Neutrons","Temperature dependence","Photoluminescence","Spectroscopy","Atomic measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","neutron effects","carrier mobility","annealing","vacancies (crystal)","deep levels","photoluminescence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility","radiation induced order effect","silicon doped N-type gallium arsenide","reactor neutron irradiation","annealing","EL12 deep level","photoluminescence spectroscopy","vacancy","point defect","550 C","1 MeV","GaAs:Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A mobility study of the radiation induced order effect in gallium arsenide","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871554","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mobility study of the radiation induced order effect in gallium arsenide","sourcePdf":"00340527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036972S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"25","articleId":"340527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340528,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Xapsos","affiliation":["Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., DC, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Xapsos","id":"37267717000"},{"name":"G.P.

These comparisons include the nonionizing energy loss rate, the mean recoil damage energy spectra, and their associated variance. In the limit of bulk material, both approaches are in good agreement. Sensitive volumes shrink and incident proton energies increase, the ranges of the spallation recoil fragments approach the smallest dimension of the microvolume, and the pixel-to-pixel damage variance increases rapidly. In this regime, a Monte Carlo approach is used to describe the damage energy distribution. Indeed, we show that such simulations predict the 63 MeV proton-induced dark current histograms more accurately than present analytic methods.

For diodes on lightly-doped substrates (<1/spl times/10/sup 15/ cm/sup -3/), struck by a 100-MeV Fe ion, the funneling effect is very strong and essentially all collection is by funnel-assisted drift. This drift collection may occur as late as several nanoseconds after the strike, later than is usually associated with drift collection. For moderately-doped substrates (=1/spl times/10/sup 16/ cm/sup -3/) and epitaxial structures grown on heavily-doped substrates, the funnel effect is weaker and drift and diffusion are of more equal importance. For 5-MeV He (/spl alpha/-particle) strikes with low-density charge tracks, the charge-collection transient exhibits both drift and diffusion regimes regardless of the substrate doping. Simulations of diodes with passive external loads indicate that while the current response is altered considerably by the load, total collected charge is not greatly affected for the simple resistive loads studied. Three-dimensional mixed-mode simulation is performed to investigate charge-collection behavior and upset mechanisms in complete CMOS SRAM cells. Simulations of double SRAM cell structures indicate that only collection by diffusion from \"between-node\" strikes is capable of producing multiple-bit upsets in the simulated technology. Limitations of the simulations, specifically carrier-carrier scattering models and large concentration gradients, are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871560","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional simulation of charge collection and multiple-bit upset in Si devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional simulation of charge collection and multiple-bit upset in Si devices","sourcePdf":"00340536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089613S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"96","articleId":"340536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340538,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The proposed cell is comparable in size to a conventional DRAM cell, and computer simulations show an improvement in critical charge of two orders of magnitude over conventional 1-T DRAM cells.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.340539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340539","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340539.pdf","startPage":"2035","endPage":"2042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proposed SEU tolerant dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cell","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A proposed SEU tolerant dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cell","volume":"41","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871563","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340539/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proposed SEU tolerant dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cell","sourcePdf":"00340539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03029S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"13","articleId":"340539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":340540,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

Analysis of this data reveals that the hard errors fail into two classes, one that is consistent with the expected single-ion dose mechanism and another that is clearly inconsistent. In particular, the new class of hard errors is separable from the dosed cells based on irradiation conditions and the data-loss time scale and direction. Further, this damage is not additive between ion hits, does not follow \"effective\" LET, and is quite resistant to annealing. As a result these hard errors would accumulate over long missions and assuming the damaged element is the access transistor, can be expected in other types of storage elements with similar transistors, e.g., static RAMs and microprocessor registers. Additionally, it was found that scaling increases the susceptibility for a given ion and lowers the ion threshold, although lowered bias mitigates the damage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.340540","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340540.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A new class of single event hard errors [DRAM cells]","volume":"41","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4871564","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new class of single event hard errors [DRAM cells]","sourcePdf":"00340540.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037658S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"37","articleId":"340540","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":340543,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

The errors due to the upset of p-MOSFETs have become more susceptible at higher dose while that of the n-MOSFETs less susceptible.

Using this expression, the failure threshold voltages for the gate and drain can be analytically determined for any particular value of energy deposition along the ion's path or more commonly described as the ion's linear energy transfer (LET) function. This paper delineates our research, an in-depth study of vertical power DMOS transistors, having a 50-nm gate oxide and a strong SEGR response, subjected to various mono-energetic ions, representing particular values of LET between 0 and 83 MeV cm/sup 2/ mg/sup -1/. A description of the devices characterized, the test setup and test methodology employed, the failure threshold voltages measured, and the analysis techniques used are all summarized. Finally, an empirical equation is presented that portrays the locus of SEGR in the {-V/sub GS/, V/sub DS/} plane for all values of LET.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.340556","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340556.pdf","startPage":"2152","endPage":"2159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-event gate rupture in vertical power MOSFETs; an original empirical expression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340556/","displayDocTitle":"Single-event gate rupture in vertical power MOSFETs; an original empirical expression","volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871579","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-event gate rupture in vertical power MOSFETs; an original empirical expression","sourcePdf":"00340556.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054457S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"68","articleId":"340556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":340557,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this work, simulations are used to explore this influence of high temperature on SEGR and to support physical explanations for this effect. The reduced hole mobility at high temperature causes the hole concentration at the oxide-silicon interface to be greater, increasing the transient oxide field near the strike position. In addition, numerical calculations show that the transient oxide field decreases as the ion's angle of incidence is changed from normal.

This work is based on 3D Monte Carlo device simulation. CMOS cells are made up of ultra-thin SOI film 0.25 /spl mu/m MOSFETs without body ties operating in fully-depleted mode. The ion track is simulated by electron-hole pairs generation with an energy of 1 eV for each carrier. We took a particular care to quantify the radiation effect as a function of linear energy transfer (LET) of the ion. After irradiation of the off-state N-MOS of the inverter, electrons in excess are drained-off by source and drain contacts. Due to the lack of hole contact, excess holes tend to remain accumulated in the channel initiating a parasitic bipolar transistor mechanism. The electron current, flowing from source to drain, discharges the output capacitor, which result in a transient upset. The recovery time is then controlled by recombination of excess holes. For memory cell, even after recombination of excess holes stored in the channel, the return to initial logic state could not be achieved, which constitutes a definitive single event upset (SEU). As this would occur for LET as low as 3 MeV.Cm/sup 2/.Mg/sup -1/, hardening techniques for 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS/SOI devices are finally discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.340579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340579","endPage":"2303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340579.pdf","startPage":"2297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical study of SEUs in 0.25-/spl mu/m fully-depleted CMOS/SOI technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340579/","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical study of SEUs in 0.25-/spl mu/m fully-depleted CMOS/SOI technology","volume":"41","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4871601","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical study of SEUs in 0.25-/spl mu/m fully-depleted CMOS/SOI technology","sourcePdf":"00340579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044225S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"13","articleId":"340579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":340581,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The larger threshold voltage shifts of fully-depleted n-MOS transistors as compared to partially-depleted n-MOS transistors in an ionizing radiation environment are explained by a model coupling the radiation induced buried oxide charge to the top transistor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation response of fully-depleted MOS transistors fabricated in SIMOX","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.340582","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340582.pdf","startPage":"2317","endPage":"2321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Radiation response of fully-depleted MOS transistors fabricated in SIMOX","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871604","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation response of fully-depleted MOS transistors fabricated in SIMOX","sourcePdf":"00340582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041398S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"37","articleId":"340582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":340592,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

It allows proton exposures with arbitrary angles of incidence including random omnidirectional exposure; and the user specifies the thickness of shielding on six sides of the sensitive volume.

The results are compared with those obtained with a nominal 0.1 inch spherical shield. The rates for GCR (solar minimum) are systematically lower than those calculated with the nominal shield. The ratio of rates is greater than 75% for lightly shielded devices, but may be as high as a factor of two where there is shielding by other circuit boards. A more nearly realistic estimate of the rates would be obtained with a spherical shield with a thickness of at least 0.4 inches (3 gm/cm/sup 2/) for the typical satellites considered. The calculation of the SEE rate due to protons was reformulated to expedite shielding calculations. When the method was applied to the 93L422 RAM for various flare spectra, it was apparent that shielding has a first order effect on rate predictions. The calculated flare upset rates for the TDRS satellite were within 20% of the observed rates. A spherical shield of thickness 0.3 inches (2 gm/cm/sup 2/) would reproduce the rates. The method was also applied to a trapped proton environment predicted from standard models for CRRES. The predicted rate was consistent with the uncertainties of the environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of realistic satellite shielding on SEE rates","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.340593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340593.pdf","startPage":"2396","endPage":"2399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Effects of realistic satellite shielding on SEE rates","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871615","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of realistic satellite shielding on SEE rates","sourcePdf":"00340593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043947S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"24","articleId":"340593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340596,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

The analysis was carried out experimentally by examining the consequences of interchanging the order in which the two stress types were applied to identical transistors which were stressed to various levels of damage. The results indicate that the hot-carrier response of the transistor is improved by radiation damage, whereas hot-carrier damage has little effect on subsequent radiation stress. Characterization of the temporal progression of hot-carrier effects revealed that hot-carrier stress acts initially to reduce excess base current and improve current gain in irradiated transistors. PISCES simulations show that the magnitude of the peak electric-field within the emitter-base depletion region is reduced significantly by net positive oxide charges induced by radiation. The interaction of the two stress types is explained in a qualitative model based on the probability of hot-carrier injection determined by radiation damage and on the neutralization and compensation of radiation-induced positive oxide charges by injected electrons. The results imply that a bound on damage due to the combined stress types is achieved when hot-carrier stress precedes any irradiation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.340596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340596.pdf","startPage":"2412","endPage":"2419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Synergetic effects of radiation stress and hot-carrier stress on the current gain of npn bipolar junction transistors","volume":"41","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871618","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340596/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synergetic effects of radiation stress and hot-carrier stress on the current gain of npn bipolar junction transistors","sourcePdf":"00340596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053758S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","articleId":"340596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":340597,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The Kirk effect limits the current density of discrete transistors with high collector breakdown voltage, increasing their sensitivity to ionizing radiation because they must operate low injection levels. Bias conditions during irradiation had different effects on discrete and integrated circuit transistors: discrete devices were strongly dependent on bias conditions, whereas damage in the linear ICs was nearly the same with or without bias. There were also large differences in the response of these devices at low dose rates. None of the discrete transistors exhibited enhanced damage at low dose rates, whereas substantially more damage occurred in the linear devices under low dose rate conditions, particularly for parameters that rely directly on p-n-p transistors. The threshold for dose rate effects in p-n-p transistors was about 0.01 rad(Si)/s, which is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding threshold for n-p-n transistors in integrated circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.340598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340598.pdf","startPage":"2427","endPage":"2436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total dose effects in conventional bipolar transistors and linear integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Total dose effects in conventional bipolar transistors and linear integrated circuits","volume":"41","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4871620","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340598/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total dose effects in conventional bipolar transistors and linear integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00340598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029568S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"163","articleId":"340598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340601,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

Additional variations in EEPROM hardness were found to depend on bias condition and failure mode (i.e., inability to read or write the memory), as well as the foundry at which the part was manufactured. This variability is related to system requirements, and it is shown that hardness level and variability affect the allowable mode of operation for EEPROMs in space applications. The radiation hardness of commercial 1-Mbit CMOS SRAMs from Micron, Hitachi, and Sony irradiated at 147 rad(Si)/s was approximately 12, 13, and 19 krad(Si), respectively. These failure levels appear to be related to increases in leakage current during irradiation. Hardness of SRAMs from each manufacturer varied by less than 20%, but differences between manufacturers are significant. The qualified manufacturer's list approach to radiation hardness assurance is suggested as a way to reduce variability and to improve the hardness level of commercial technologies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340613.pdf","startPage":"2536","endPage":"2543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.340613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardness variability in commercial technologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space technology","Manufacturing","Space vehicles","Payloads","Radiation hardening","Laboratories","Integrated circuit technology","Read-write memory","Foundries","Leakage current"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation hardening (electronics)","CMOS integrated circuits","SRAM chips","EPROM","integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardness variability","commercial technologies","radiation hardness","commercial floating gate","single diffusion lot","irradiated","low dose rate","EEPROM hardness","bias condition","failure mode","read","write","memory","variability","system requirements","allowable mode","space applications","commercial 1-Mbit CMOS SRAMs","Micron","Hitachi","Sony","failure levels","256 Kbit","1 Mbit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Hardness variability in commercial technologies","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871635","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardness variability in commercial technologies","sourcePdf":"00340613.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042521S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"35","articleId":"340613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340614,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These stresses lead to larger radiation-induced transistor threshold-voltage shifts and increases in IC static power supply leakage current (two orders of magnitude) in stressed ICs than for ICs not subjected to a stress. In addition, these stresses led to reduced degradation in timing parameters. The major cause of the differences is less radiation-induced interface-trap buildup for transistors subjected to an elevated-temperature biased stress. These results were observed for two distinctly different technologies and have significant implications on hardness assurance testing. One could significantly (1) overestimate degradation in timing parameters resulting in the rejection of acceptable ICs and increased system cost, or (2) underestimate the increase in static supply leakage current of ICs leading to system failure. These results suggest that radiation qualification testing must be performed on integrated circuits that have been subjected to all high-temperature biased stresses experienced in normal production flow or system use.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.340615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7975/00340615.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.340615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975","startPage":"2550","endPage":"2559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of burn-in on radiation hardness","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of burn-in on radiation hardness","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871637","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of burn-in on radiation hardness","sourcePdf":"00340615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06324S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"53","articleId":"340615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340618,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

While there are differences in the structure of laser- and ion-generated charge tracks, we show that in many cases the pulsed laser remains an invaluable tool for SEE testing.

Five different radiation sources were used for the exposures: three /sup 60/Co sources, a 10-keV X-ray source, and a /sup 137/Cs source. The /sup 137/Cs exposures at 0.01 rad(SiO/sub 2/)/s are two orders of magnitude lower in dose rate than any previous irradiations for this process and thus facilitate comparison to the device response in space. Low-dose-rate gain degradation exceeds high-dose-rate degradation for total doses less than 1 Mrad(SiO/sub 2/), consistent with previous reports. For the first time, the gain degradation is demonstrated to be equivalent for dose rates between 0.01 and 10 rad(SiO/sub 2/)/s, suggesting that the dose-rate response saturates at /spl sim/10 rad(SiO/sub 2/)/s for the devices studied in this work. On the basis of a recent model, high-dose-rate irradiations at 60/spl deg/C were performed and found to be consistent with the room-temperature, low-dose-rate, saturated response.

The development of a new projector/backprojector for implementing attenuation, geometric point response, and scatter models is motivated by the need to reduce the computation time yet to preserve the fidelity of the corrected reconstruction. At each projection angle, the projector/backprojector first rotates the image volume so that the pixelized cube remains parallel to the detector, and then warps the image volume so that the fan-beam and cone-beam rays are converted into parallel rays. In the authors' implementation, these two steps are combined so that the interpolation of voxel values are performed only once. The projection operation is achieved by a simple weighted summation, and the backprojection operation is achieved by copying weighted projection array values to the image volume. An advantage of this projector/backprojector is that the system point response function can be deconvolved via the Fast Fourier Transform using the shift-invariant property of the point response when the voxel-to-detector distance is constant. The fan-beam and cone-beam rotating-and-warping projector/backprojector is applied to SPECT data showing improved resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340651/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4854438","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","displayDocTitle":"A rotating and warping projector/backprojector for fan-beam and cone-beam iterative algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rotating and warping projector/backprojector for fan-beam and cone-beam iterative algorithm","sourcePdf":"00340651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040415S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"51","articleId":"340651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":340771,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The velocity responses of individual outer hair cells and Hensen's cells to sinusoidal and amplitude modulated (AM) acoustical signals applied at the ear canal display characteristics typical of nonlinear systems, including the generation of harmonic and half-harmonic components. The STFT proves to be valuable for following the time course of the frequency components generated using sinusoidal and ARM input signals. The CWT is also useful for analyzing these signals; however, it is generally not as effective as the STFT when octave-band-based CWT's are used. For the transient response, the spectrogram (which is the squared magnitude of the STFT) and the octave-band-based scalogram (which is the squared magnitude of the CWT) prove equally valuable, and the authors have used both to study the responses of these cells to step-onset tones of different frequencies. Such analyses reveal information about the preferred vibration frequencies of cells in the inner ear and are useful for deciding among alternative mathematical models of nonlinear cellular dynamics. A modified Duffing oscillator model yields results that bear some similarity to the data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.340771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7978/00340771.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.340771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978","startPage":"3335","endPage":"3352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigating the nonlinear dynamics of cellular motion in the inner ear using the short-time Fourier and continuous wavelet transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigating the nonlinear dynamics of cellular motion in the inner ear using the short-time Fourier and continuous wavelet transforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4856366","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating the nonlinear dynamics of cellular motion in the inner ear using the short-time Fourier and continuous wavelet transforms","sourcePdf":"00340771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070392S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","articleId":"340771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":340773,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The concept of a pure nth-order sine wave is introduced, and it is shown that pure nth-order sine-wave strengths in the output time-series are given by scaled Fourier coefficients of the polyperiodic temporal cumulant of the input time-series. The higher order moments and cumulants of narrowband spectral components of time-series are defined and then idealized to the case of infinitesimal bandwidth. Such spectral moments and cumulants are shown to be characterized by the Fourier transforms of the temporal moments and cumulants of the time-series.

A new type of cumulant for complex-valued variables is introduced and used to generalize the temporal and spectral moments and cumulants for cyclostationary time-series from real-valued to complex-valued time-series. The relations between the temporal and spectral moments and cumulants at the inputs and outputs of several signal processing operations are determined. Formulas for the temporal and spectral cumulants of complex-valued pulse-amplitude-modulated time-series are derived. Estimators for the temporal moments and cumulants and for the cyclic polyspectra are presented and their properties are discussed. The performance of these estimators is illustrated by several computer simulation examples for pulse-amplitude-modulated time-series.

Parametric models obtained via second-order statistics (SOS) are appropriate when the available data is Gaussian and time-reversible. On the other hand, evidence of nonlinearity, non-Gaussianity, or time-irreversibility favors the use of higher-order statistics (HOS). In order to validate Gaussianity and time-reversibility, and quantify the tradeoffs between SOS and HOS, consistent, time-domain chi-squared statistical tests are developed. Exact asymptotic distributions are derived to estimate the power of the tests, including a covariance expression for fourth-order sample cumulants. A modification of existing linearity tests in the presence of additive Gaussian noise is discussed briefly. The novel Gaussianity statistic is computationally attractive, leads to a constant-false-alarm-rate test and is well suited for parametric modeling because it employs the minimal HOS lags which uniquely characterize ARMA processes. Simulations include comparisons with an existing frequency-domain approach and an application to real seismic data. Time-reversibility tests are also derived and their performance is analyzed both theoretically and experimentally.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.340780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7978/00340780.pdf","startPage":"3460","endPage":"3472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.340780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-domain tests for Gaussianity and time-reversibility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340780/","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain tests for Gaussianity and time-reversibility","volume":"42","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4856375","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain tests for Gaussianity and time-reversibility","sourcePdf":"00340780.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051449S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"66","articleId":"340780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":340781,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Finally, the theory of linear mean square estimation for complex signals exhibits some connections with circularity, and it is shown that without this assumption, the estimation theory must be reformulated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.340781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.340781","startPage":"3473","endPage":"3482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7978/00340781.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On circularity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"On circularity","volume":"42","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4856376","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On circularity","sourcePdf":"00340781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045472S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"370","articleId":"340781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":340782,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"lastName":"Ye Li","id":"37350651600"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"lastName":"Zhi Ding","id":"37278651400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"340782","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Previous work has presented novel techniques that exploit cyclostationarity for channel identification in data communication systems. The present authors investigate the identifiability of linear time-invariant (LTI) ARMA systems based on second-order cyclic statistics. They present a parametric and a nonparametric method. The parametric method directly identifies the zeros and poles of ARMA channels with a mixed phase. The nonparametric method estimates the channel phase based on the cyclic spectra alone. They analyze the phase estimation error of the nonparametric method for finite dimensional ARMA channels. For specific, finite dimensional ARMA channels, an improved method is given, which combines the parametric method with the nonparametric method.

With few exceptions, these algorithms require an exact characterization of the array, including knowledge of the sensor positions, sensor gain/phase response, mutual coupling, and receiver equipment effects. Unless all sensors are identical, this information must typically be obtained by experimental measurements (calibration). In practice, of course, all such information is inevitably subject to errors. Several different methods have been proposed for alleviating the inherent sensitivity of parametric methods to such modelling errors. The technique proposed in the present paper is related to the class of so-called auto-calibration procedures, but it is assumed that certain prior knowledge of the array response errors is available. This is a reasonable assumption in most applications, and it allows for more general perturbation models than does pure auto-calibration. The optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for the problem at hand is formulated, and a computationally more attractive large-sample approximation is derived. The proposed technique is shown to be statistically efficient, and the achievable performance is illustrated by numerical evaluation and computer simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.340783","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7978/00340783.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.340783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"3495","endPage":"3507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian approach to auto-calibration for parametric array signal processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian approach to auto-calibration for parametric array signal processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340783/","volume":"42","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4856378","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian approach to auto-calibration for parametric array signal processing","sourcePdf":"00340783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035612S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"118","articleId":"340783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":340784,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Haw Yaou","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Haw Yaou","id":"37376500500"},{"name":"Wen-Thong Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Thong Chang","id":"37346196800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"340784","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Filter bank","Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet analysis","Signal analysis","Filtering","Functional analysis","Sufficient conditions","Design optimization","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","wavelet transforms","signal reconstruction","filtering theory","frequency-domain synthesis","digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-ary wavelet transform","perfect reconstruction","M-band filter bank","binary wavelet transform","biorthonormal case","computational equivalence","discrete wavelet analysis","multirate signal filtering","perfect reconstruction requirement","filter bank","vector space decomposition","vector space reconstruction","wavelet base","optimization procedure","frequency domain requirement"]}],"abstract":"The binary wavelet transform is generalized and extended to the M-ary biorthonormal case.

We show fully symbolic analysis results for much larger circuits than have ever been reported. Very compact symbolic expressions for the DC small signal voltage gains of the 741 and 725 operational amplifiers were obtained in less than 40 CPU seconds on a SUN SPARCstation 2, and the simplified results were numerically within 12% of the exact values. The output is expressed in terms of products of sums which can give the user insight into the behavior of the circuit. The overall time complexity is superquadratic with respect to the number of nodes. The implementation can output simplified symbolic expressions for any desired DC small signal transfer function, including input resistances, output resistances, as well as current and voltage gains.

This is mainly due to the fact that, with the exception of the linear case, no sufficiently general methods exist at present for the processing of electrical signals using analog systems, nonlinear dynamical systems of the kind described by ordinary differential equations are quite general since they embody a large class of problems. Thus, synthesis of such systems plays a central role in this context. The aim of this paper is to present an approach to the analog synthesis, based on the approximate identity neural networks (a class of neural networks recently proposed). The method is fairly general since it can be applied to a large category of nonlinear systems. Some examples of dynamical systems developed using conventional analog circuitry show the feasibility of the approach and the usefulness for the experimental evidence of many interesting effects such as subharmonic oscillations and chaotic behavior.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.340846","startPage":"841","endPage":"858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.340846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/7979/00340846.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate identity neural networks for analog synthesis of nonlinear dynamical systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340846/","displayDocTitle":"Approximate identity neural networks for analog synthesis of nonlinear dynamical systems","volume":"41","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4873217","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate identity neural networks for analog synthesis of nonlinear dynamical systems","sourcePdf":"00340846.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04523S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"7","articleId":"340846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":340848,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

This model class consists of a subclass of artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons. Specifically, we discuss the application of a \"globally\" convergent optimization scheme to the training of the multilayer perceptron. The algorithm discussed is termed the conjugate gradients-trust regions algorithm (CGTR) and combines the merits of two well known \"global\" algorithms-the conjugate gradients and the trust region algorithms. In this paper we investigate the potential of the multilayer perceptron, trained using the CGTR algorithm, towards function approximation in two diverse scenarios: i) signal classification in a multiuser communication system, and ii) approximating the inverse kinematics of a robotic manipulator. Until recently, the most widely used training algorithm has been the backpropagation algorithm, which is based on the linearly convergent steepest descent algorithm. It is seen that the multilayer perceptron trained with the CGTR algorithm is able to approximate the desired functions to a greater accuracy than when trained using backpropagation. Specifically, in the case of the multiuser communication problem, we obtain lower probabilities of error in demodulating a given user's signal; and in the robotics problem, we observe lower root mean square errors in approximating the inverse kinematics function.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4873219","volume":"41","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An algorithm for training multilayer perceptrons for data classification and function interpolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algorithm for training multilayer perceptrons for data classification and function interpolation","sourcePdf":"00340848.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04975S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"19","articleId":"340848","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":340850,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

Spectral parameters (mean frequency, median frequency, and equivalent statistical bandwidth) of the MES were calculated and examined for significant differences between the remnant muscle data and intact muscle data. Other factors were examined for possible significant effect on the spectral content of the MES. Although no pattern of spectral difference between the MES of residual versus intact limb muscles was found, spectral differences were apparent by visual inspection in most cases. Level of amputation (above elbow or below elbow) was the sole factor found to have a significant effect on the MES spectral content. Data were separated based on level of amputation; no statistically significant difference between the spectral parameters of residual versus intact muscle MES was found. However, greater variation in the spectral parameters of the remnant muscle data was observed.

The ANN controller was used to learn and store the optimal patterns of muscle stimulation for a range of single joint movements. These stimulation patterns were obtained from an optimal control strategy that minimizes muscle activation or muscular effort. Feedforward, recurrent feedback, and time delay topologies of neural networks were considered for this application. The choice of a network structure was based on the learning performance and ability to generalize a learned muscle simulation pattern to novel movements. A comparison showed that the feedforward network combined with recurrent feedback and input time delays can most effectively capture the optimal temporal profiles of muscle stimulation. This neural network controller further demonstrated remarkable ability to generalize the learned optimal control to a class of scaled movements. The authors also evaluated open-loop performance of movement control by the ANN with a nonlinear muscle/joint model. The trained neural network controller reproduced the range of scaled optimal movements well, though sometimes with terminal position errors. This study showed that neural networks were promising as an open-loop pattern generator for muscle stimulation signals in movement restoration by functional electrical stimulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/86.340877","startPage":"213","endPage":"224","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/7980/00340877.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.340877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network generation of muscle stimulation patterns for control of arm movements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Muscles","Artificial neural networks","Optimal control","Open loop systems","Neurofeedback","Delay effects","Network topology","Recurrent neural networks","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocontrol","muscle","neurophysiology","biomechanics","orthotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network generation","muscle stimulation patterns","arm movements control","optimal patterns","single joint movements","optimal control strategy","muscular effort","feedforward","recurrent feedback","time delay topology","input time delays","learned optimal control","scaled movements","open-loop performance","terminal position errors","functional electrical stimulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340877/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural network generation of muscle stimulation patterns for control of arm movements","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4857127","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network generation of muscle stimulation patterns for control of arm movements","sourcePdf":"00340877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063607S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"58","articleId":"340877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":340892,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The authors present a novel approach to characterize and model the multimedia traffic using neural networks (NNs). A backpropagation NN is used to characterize and predict the statistical variations of the packet arrival process resulting from the superposition of N packetized video sources and M packetized voice sources. The accuracy of the results is verified by matching the index of dispersion for counts (IDC), the variance, and the autocorrelation of the arrival process to those of the NN output.

For each keyword, two statistical models, named hidden Markov models (HMMs), are created for representing the actual keyword and all the other extraneous words, respectively. Dynamic programming is then used for matching an unknown input word with the two models and making a maximum likelihood decision. Both the 1D and pseudo-2D HMM approaches are proposed and tested. The 2D models are shown to be general enough in characterizing printed words efficiently. These pseudo-2D HMMs facilitate an elastic matching property in both the horizontal and vertical directions, which makes the recognizer not only independent of size and slant but also tolerant of highly deformed and noisy words. The system is evaluated on a synthetically created database. Recognition accuracy of 99% is achieved when words in testing and training sets are in the same font size, and 96% is achieved when they are in different sizes. In the latter case, the 1D HMM achieves only a 70% accuracy rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1993.340961","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/916/7982/00340961.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1993.340961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7982","startPage":"329","endPage":"334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual keyword recognition using hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visual keyword recognition using hidden Markov models","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340961/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4834444","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual keyword recognition using hidden Markov models","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00340961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025917S","chronDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","isNumber":"7982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"916","citationCount":"3","articleId":"340961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":340962,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The authors' algorithm assumes the motion to be along a smooth trajectory and the sequence of images to be dense. The algorithm starts by calculating the instantaneous FOE (focus of expansion). Knowing the FOE, a MAP estimate of the displacement at each pixel and an associated confidence measure are calculated. Using the displacement estimates, a relative depth map is calculated from one of the two frame sequences. By calculating the disparities at some feature points and using information about their relative depths, the instantaneous component of velocity in the direction perpendicular to the image plane (the Z direction) is computed. Using this information, a depth map is calculated; this depth map is then used to derive a prior probability distribution for disparity that is used in matching the two frames of the stereo pairs. This method is used to estimate the disparity of each pixel independently.

The statistical theory or the Cramer-Rao lower bound is used for error covariance in the estimated motion and structure parameters. This enables the derivation of results valid for any unbiased estimator under the assumption of Gaussian noise in the motion field. The obtained lower-bound-matrix is studied analytically with respect to measurement noise, size of the field of view, and the motion-geometry configuration. The coupling between translation and rotation is exacerbated if the field of view and the slant of the plane become smaller, and the deviation of the translation from the viewing direction becomes larger. The relationships of the uncertainty bounds for every unknown motion parameter to the angle between translation and the plane-normal, the size of the field of view, and the distance from the perceived plane and the translation magnitude are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The coupling of rotation and translation in motion estimation of planar surfaces","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1993.340990","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/916/7982/00340990.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1993.340990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=340990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/340990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"The coupling of rotation and translation in motion estimation of planar surfaces","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4834424","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The coupling of rotation and translation in motion estimation of planar surfaces","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00340990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046378S","chronDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","isNumber":"7982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"916","citationCount":"42","articleId":"340990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":340996,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Generally, there are two information sources associated with the written text. While the shape information of each character symbol is modeled as a mixture Gaussian distribution, the linguistic knowledge, i.e., constraint, is modeled as a Markov chain. In this context, the variable duration state is used to take care of the segmentation ambiguity among the consecutive characters.

These are projections in which the epipolar lines run parallel with the x-axis and disparities between the images are in the x-direction only. The method is based on an examination of the essential matrix of Longuet-Higgins (1981), which describes the epipolar geometry of the image pair. The approach taken is consistent with that advocated by O. Faugeras (1992) of avoiding camera calibration. A matrix called the epipolar transformation matrix is defined. It is used to determine a pair of 2-D projective transforms to be applied to the two images in order to match the epipolar lines. The advantages include the simplicity of the 2-D projective transformation, which allows very fast resampling, as well as subsequent simplification in identifying matched points and in scene reconstruction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1993.341076","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/916/7982/00341076.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1993.341076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7982","startPage":"549","endPage":"555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing matched-epipolar projections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=341076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Computing matched-epipolar projections","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341076/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4823699","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing matched-epipolar projections","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00341076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039232S","chronDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","isNumber":"7982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"916","citationCount":"46","articleId":"341076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":341078,"authors":[{"name":"C.-K.

The facet approach to curvature estimation involves least square fitting the observed data points to a parametric cubic polynomial and the calculation of the curvature analytically from the fitted parametric coefficients. Due to the fitting, there exists systematic error or bias between curvature which is calculated analytically from the parameterization of a circle and one which is calculated analytically based on the coefficients of the fitted cubic polynomial, even when the data are sampled from a noiseless circle. It is shown how to compensate this bias by estimating it with the coefficients of the fitted cubic polynomial, which gives more accurate curvature value. Small perturbations are introduced to the sampled data from a noiseless circle, and the authors analytically trace how the perturbation propagates through coefficients of the fitted polynomials and results in perturbation error of the curvature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1993.341078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1993.341078","startPage":"536","endPage":"541","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/916/7982/00341078.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of curvature from sampled noisy data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of curvature from sampled noisy data","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1993","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4823697","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341078/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of curvature from sampled noisy data","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00341078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030927S","chronDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","isNumber":"7982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"916","citationCount":"8","articleId":"341078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":341081,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It is shown how operators having a higher degree of selectivity and higher tolerance against noise can be constructed using simple combinations of appropriately chosen convolutions. The theory is based on linear operations and is general in that it allows for both data and operators to be scalars, vectors or tensors of higher order. Three new methods are represented: normalized convolution, differential convolution and normalized differential convolution. All three methods are examples of the power of the signal/certainty-philosophy, i.e., the separation of both data and operator into a signal part and a certainty part. Missing data are handled simply by setting the certainty to zero. In the case of uncertain data, an estimate of the certainty must accompany the data. Localization or windowing of operators is done using an applicability function, the operator equivalent to certainty, not by changing the actual operator coefficients. Spatially or temporally limited operators are handled by setting the applicability function to zero outside the window.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1993.341081","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/916/7982/00341081.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1993.341081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7982","startPage":"515","endPage":"523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalized and differential convolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=341081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Normalized and differential convolution","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341081/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4823694","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalized and differential convolution","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00341081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088437S","chronDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","isNumber":"7982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"916","citationCount":"130","articleId":"341081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":341087,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The image sequence can be decomposed into a set of overlapping layers, where each layer's motion is described by a smooth flow field. The discontinuities in the description are then attributed to object opacities rather than to the flow itself, mirroring the structure of the scene. A set of techniques is devised for segmenting images into coherently moving regions using affine motion analysis and clustering techniques. It is possible to decompose an image into a set of layers along with information about occlusion and depth ordering. The techniques are applied to a flower garden sequence. The scene can be analyzed into four layers, and, the entire 30-frame sequence can be represented with a single image of each layer, along with associated motion parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341105/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4823670","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1993","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Layered representation for motion analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layered representation for motion analysis","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00341105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036473S","chronDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","isNumber":"7982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"916","citationCount":"142","articleId":"341105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":341109,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This merging process raises many issues. These include the treatment of outliers in component velocity measurements and the modeling of multiple motions within a patch which arise from occlusion boundaries or transparency. A new approach for dealing with these issues is presented. It is based on the use of a probabilistic mixture model to explicitly represent multiple motions within a patch. A simple extension of the EM-algorithm is used to compute a maximum likelihood estimate for the various motion parameters.

For pixels on either side of a region boundary, the transformation yields high affinities, but there is little affinity between pixels across regions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1993.341172","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/916/7982/00341172.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1993.341172","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"780","endPage":"781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A transform for detection of multiscale image structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=341172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"A transform for detection of multiscale image structure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341172/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4880304","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A transform for detection of multiscale image structure","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00341172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025615S","chronDate":"15-17 Jun 1993","isNumber":"7982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"916","citationCount":"10","articleId":"341172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":341179,"authors":[{"name":"D.O.

The motivation for this endeavour stems from the observation that the human iris provides a particularly interesting structure on which to base a technology for noninvasive biometric measurement. In particular, it is known in the biomedical community that irises are as distinct as fingerprints or patterns of retinal blood vessels. Further, since the iris is an overt body its appearance is amenable to remote examination with the aid of a computer vision system. The body of this paper details the design and operation of such a system. Also presented are the results of an empirical study where the system exhibits flawless performance in the evaluation of 520 iris images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/998/7985/00341298.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ACV.1994.341298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACV.1994.341298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=341298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A system for automated iris recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iris recognition","Prototypes","Personnel","Humans","Biometrics","Biomedical measurements","Particle measurements","Waveguide discontinuities","Fingerprint recognition","Retina"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","eye","biometrics (access control)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated iris recognition","prototype system","personnel verification","noninvasive biometric measurement","computer vision","empirical study"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"A system for automated iris recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852570","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A system for automated iris recognition","confLoc":"Sarasota, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00341298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05066S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec 1994","isNumber":"7985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"998","citationCount":"148","articleId":"341298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":341300,"authors":[{"name":"F.S.

The two signals resulting from the transformation have two DC components and ripple. The two DC components contain the amplitude and the phase of the harmonic selected. As a conclusion, it is shown that the interest of this method is that the undesirable ripple has a frequency at least six times higher than the fundamental frequency.

But conventional methods of power transfer to the vehicle such as electrified tracks and batteries have remained less than ideal; that is until the recent development of a novel inductively coupled power transmission (IPT) system that is clean and spark-free, is robust to dust and water, and has very low maintenance. Load power in an IPT system is sourced at 10 kHz from tuned pick-up coils mounted adjacent to, but not touching, a sealed track conductor driven by a resonant power electronic converter. Power transfer of several kilowatts is possible from a single pick-up coil, and multiple pick-ups can be powered from the same track.

The method utilises stored information concerning the magnetic characteristics for a motor phase. However, unlike previous methods, the magnetic information is only required for one rotor position and only one position measurement per phase cycle is made. As a result the stored information is relatively small, and the calculation relatively quick such that the sensorless position detection can be executed by the SRM drive controller without necessitating a separate digital processor or extensive additional hardware. The paper fully describes the method and discusses its accuracy and stability. It also describes and presents results from an experimental system used to verify the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Fifth International Conference on Power Electronics and Variable-Speed Drives","pdfPath":"/iel3/1144/7990/00341673.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"17","publicationTitle":"1994 Fifth International Conference on Power Electronics and Variable-Speed Drives","doi":"10.1049/cp:19940932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19940932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=341673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sensorless method for determining rotor position for switched reluctance motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Position control","Position measurement","Reluctance motor drives","Machine windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","machine testing","machine theory","measurement theory","position control","position measurement","reluctance motor drives","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched reluctance motors","rotor position measurement","sensorless method","magnetic characteristics","rotor position","drive controller","accuracy","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"A sensorless method for determining rotor position for switched reluctance motors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4834594","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sensorless method for determining rotor position for switched reluctance motors","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00341673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024494S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct 1994","isNumber":"7990","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1144","citationCount":"37","articleId":"341673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":341674,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Their dynamic characteristics vary as conditions change. Recently, several methods of modelling of the magnetic saturation of SRMs have been proposed. However, the SRM is nonlinear and cannot be adequately described by such models. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) may be used to overcome this problem. This paper presents a method which uses a backpropagation algorithm to handle one of the modelling problems in a switched reluctance motor. The simulated waveforms of phase current are compared with those obtained from a commercial switched reluctance motor. Experimental results validate the applicability of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1049/cp:19940931","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Fifth International Conference on Power Electronics and Variable-Speed Drives","pdfPath":"/iel3/1144/7990/00341674.pdf","publicationTitle":"1994 Fifth International Conference on Power Electronics and Variable-Speed Drives","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19940931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of a nonlinear switched reluctance drive based on artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backpropagation","Simulation","Electromagnetic fields","Magnetization processes","Neural networks","Reluctance motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","digital simulation","electric machine analysis computing","electromagnetic fields","machine theory","magnetisation","neural nets","reluctance motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched reluctance motor","artificial neural networks","modelling","magnetic saturation","electric drives","computer simulation","dynamic characteristics","performance","backpropagation algorithm","phase current"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of a nonlinear switched reluctance drive based on artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4834593","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of a nonlinear switched reluctance drive based on artificial neural networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00341674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065363S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct 1994","isNumber":"7990","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1144","citationCount":"17","articleId":"341674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":341682,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Fundamental soliton solutions have been obtained for both anomalous dispersion regimes (/spl betasub 2/<0) and normal dispersion regimes (/spl betasub 2/>0) without using inverse scattering or the Backlund transform. By considering the amplitude and the phase of the complex solution separately, a set of amplitude-phase coupled nonlinear equations is derived from the NLSE. The characteristic equation satisfied by the envelope amplitude is obtained for the fundamental soliton and soliton-modulated wave. The conditions to be satisfied by the phase propagation constant and soliton power give rise to useful criteria for the design of optical soliton communication systems.

At 200/spl deg/C the amplifier maintains an input offset voltage and current of less than 200 /spl mu/V and 1 nA respectively, a gain bandwidth product of 2.2 MHz, and a slew rate of 5.4 V//spl mu/S. The amplifier is fabricated in a standard CMOS process and consumes 5.5 mW of power at a supply voltage of 5 V. A continuous time auto-zeroed amplifier topology is used to achieve the low offset voltage levels. At high temperatures the leakage currents of the sample and hold switches used to achieve auto-zeroing, degrading the offset correction voltages stored on the hold capacitors. This degradation is reduced by using large external hold capacitors and by minimizing the diffusion area of the switches through the use of a doughnut shaped layout. The effect of the voltage degradation is reduced by sensing the offset correction voltage with a low sensitivity differential auxiliary input stage. A new input switch topology is used to reduce the amplifier's input offset current at high temperatures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7992/00341738.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.341738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.341738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7992","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=341738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high temperature precision amplifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Switches","Degradation","Topology","Low voltage","Capacitors","Operational amplifiers","Instruments","Circuits","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifiers","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","instrumentation amplifiers","leakage currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high temperature precision amplifier","operational amplifier","instrumentation applications","CMOS process","continuous time auto-zeroed amplifier topology","low offset voltage levels","offset correction voltages","hold capacitors","doughnut shaped layout","voltage degradation","differential auxiliary input stage","input switch topology","input offset current reduction","CMOS op amp","200 C","200 muV","1 nA","5.5 W","5 V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"A high temperature precision amplifier","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4899501","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high temperature precision amplifier","sourcePdf":"00341738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036574S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"7992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"33","articleId":"341738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":341740,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The authors then design adaptive controllers with an adaptive hysteresis inverse for plants with unknown hysteresis. A new adaptive controller structure is introduced which is capable of achieving a linear parameterization and a linear error model in the presence of a hysteresis nonlinearity. A robust adaptive law is used to update the controller parameters and hysteresis inverse parameters, which ensures the global boundedness of the closed-loop signals for a wide class of of hysteresis models. Simulations show that the use of the adaptive hysteresis inverse leads to major improvements of system performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7994/00341778.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.341778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.341778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7994","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=341778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of plants with unknown hystereses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Hysteresis","Programmable control","System performance","Error correction","Robust control","Gears","Nonlinear systems","Hydraulic actuators","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","hysteresis","control nonlinearities","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","unknown hystereses","parameterized hysteresis model","hysteresis inverse","linear parameterization","linear error model","hysteresis nonlinearity","robust adaptive law","global boundedness","closed-loop signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of plants with unknown hystereses","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4887544","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of plants with unknown hystereses","sourcePdf":"00341778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03929S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"7994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"467","articleId":"341778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":341782,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.

This investigation combined these two techniques by first whitening, then combining the data from multiple EMG recording sites to form an EMG amplitude estimate. A phenomenological mathematical model of multiple sites of the surface EMG waveform, with analytic solution for an optimal amplitude estimate, is presented. Experimental surface EMG waveforms were then sampled from multiple sites during nonfatiguing, constant-force, isometric contractions of the biceps or triceps muscles, over the range of 10-75% maximum voluntary contraction. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was computed from each amplitude estimate (deviations about the mean value of the estimate were considered as noise). Results showed that SNR performance: 1) increased with the number of EMG sites, 2) was a function of the sampling frequency, 3) was predominantly invariant to various methods of determining spatial uncorrelation filters, 4) was not sensitive to the intersite correlations of the electrode configuration investigated, and 5) was best at lower levels of contraction. A moving average root mean square estimator (245-ms window) provided an average /spl plusmn/ standard deviation (A/spl plusmn/SD) SNR of 10.7/spl plusmn/3.3 for single site unwhitened recordings. Temporal whitening and four combined sites improved the A/spl plusmn/SD SNR to 24.6/spl plusmn/10.4. On one subject, eight whitened combined sites were achieved, providing an A/spl plusmn/SD SNR of 35.0/spl plusmn/13.4.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4877292","pubMedId":"7868148","volume":"42","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiple site electromyograph amplitude estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple site electromyograph amplitude estimation","sourcePdf":"00341833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037452S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"7995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"66","articleId":"341833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":341862,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

Examples of such systems abound, including flexible joint and flexible link robots, space robots, mobile robots, and robot models that include actuator dynamics and rigid body dynamics together. Complex internal dynamics, nonholonomic behavior, and lack of feedback linearizability are often exhibited by such systems, making the class a rich one from a control standpoint. In this article the author studies a particular underactuated system known as the Acrobot: a two-degree-of-freedom planar robot with a single actuator. The author considers the so-called swing up control problem using the method of partial feedback linearization. The author gives conditions under which the response of either degree of freedom may be globally decoupled from the response of the other and linearized. This result can be used as a starting point to design swing up control algorithms. Analysis of the resulting zero dynamics as well as analysis of the energy of the system provides an understanding of the swing up algorithms. Simulation results are presented showing the swing up motion resulting from partial feedback linearization designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.341864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.341864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/7997/00341864.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The swing up control problem for the Acrobot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","displayDocTitle":"The swing up control problem for the Acrobot","volume":"15","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4898028","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The swing up control problem for the Acrobot","sourcePdf":"00341864.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04356S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"7997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"641","articleId":"341864","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":341866,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The authors assume a sensor structure which consists of a flexible, spherical, fingertip-like body and a quadruple polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, a kind of piezoelectric polymer) sound-sensing matrix embedded at the center of the body. Any points on the spherical surface work as emission sources when touched, and the body transmits the waves inward. The PVDF matrix works as a wideband acoustic emission (AE) transducer which is capable of detecting arrival directions of the waves, packet by packet. This means it can independently resolve and localize a series of ultrasonic emissions caused by a touch and slip. In order to realize this type of tactile sensor, the authors consider two important questions: 1) What kind of ultrasonic emissions appear by touch, and are they detectable? 2) How can the multiple wave packets be resolved and localized instantaneously? For the first question, the authors develop a theory of wave generation at collision, and examine detectability by several experiments. For the second question, the authors show how their sound localization algorithm for an auditory sensor is applied. By assuming the use of this algorithm, and from several experiments under various contact and slip conditions, the authors confirm that the following features and tactile information are obtainable: 1) quick localization of touch and separation; 2) sensation of surface roughness under movements; and 3) quick detection of precursor of slip.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/341866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4898030","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic emission tactile sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic emission tactile sensing","sourcePdf":"00341866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057234S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"7997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"38","articleId":"341866","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":342015,"authors":[{"name":"N.J.

As there is a natural relationship between error diffusion and /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulation, the reconstruction algorithm can also be applied to the decoding problem for /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8003/00342186.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.342186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.342186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Halftone to continuous-tone conversion of error-diffusion coded images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image converters","Image reconstruction","Computer displays","Iterative algorithms","Low pass filters","Nonlinear filters","Decoding","Large screen displays","Printers","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image coding","decoding","sigma-delta modulation","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["halftone to continuous-tone conversion","error-diffusion coded images","contone image","halftoning process","iterative nonlinear decoding algorithm","reconstruction","/spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulation","/spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Halftone to continuous-tone conversion of error-diffusion coded images","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4895257","pubMedId":"18289972","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Halftone to continuous-tone conversion of error-diffusion coded images","sourcePdf":"00342186.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075353S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"68","articleId":"342186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":342187,"authors":[{"name":"C.I.

The results include a 1-Mbps coder based on a new adaptive differential pulse code modulation scheme (ADPCM) and adaptive bit allocation. This rate is useful for video storage on CD-ROM. Coding results are also shown for a 384-kbps rate that are based on ADPCM for the lowest frequency band and a new form of vector quantization (geometric vector quantization (GVQ)) for the data in the higher frequency bands. GVQ takes advantage of the inherent structure and sparseness of the data in the higher bands. Results are also shown for a 128-kbps coder that is based on an unbalanced tree-structured vector quantizer (UTSVQ) for the lowest frequency band and GVQ for the higher frequency bands. The results are competitive with traditional video coding techniques and provide the motivation for investigating the 3-D subband framework for different coding schemes and various applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8003/00342187.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.342187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.342187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional subband coding of video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Bit rate","Frequency","Video coding","Pulse modulation","Radio spectrum management","Discrete cosine transforms","Filter bank","Modulation coding","Vector quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","differential pulse code modulation","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional subband coding","video coding","spatio-temporal subband decomposition","adaptive differential pulse code modulation","ADPCM","adaptive bit allocation","video storage","CD-ROM","VQ","geometric vector quantization","unbalanced tree-structured vector quantizer","UTSVQ","3-D subband coding","384 kbit/s","1 Mbit/s","128 kbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional subband coding of video","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4895250","pubMedId":"18289965","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional subband coding of video","sourcePdf":"00342187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05322S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"120","articleId":"342187","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":342188,"authors":[{"name":"Dae Gwon Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Avionics Engineering, Hankuk Aviation University, Koyang, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae Gwon Jeong","id":"37087634382"},{"name":"J.D.

The paper describes and parameterizes the cosine-modulated class of multiplicity M wavelet tight frames (WTFs). In these WTFs, the scaling function uniquely determines the wavelets. This is in contrast to the general multiplicity M case, where one has to, for any given application, design the scaling function and the wavelets. Several design techniques for the design of K regular cosine-modulated WTFs are described and their relative merits discussed. Wavelets in K-regular WTFs may or may not be smooth, Since coding applications use WTFs with short length scaling and wavelet vectors (since long filters produce ringing artifacts, which is undesirable in, say, image coding), many smooth designs of K regular WTFs of short lengths are presented. In some cases, analytical formulas for the scaling and wavelet vectors are also given. In many applications, smoothness of the wavelets is more important than K regularity. The authors define smoothness of filter banks and WTFs using the concept of total variation and give several useful designs based on this smoothness criterion. Optimal design of cosine-modulated WTFs for signal representation is also described. All WTFs constructed in the paper are orthonormal bases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.342190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8003/00342190.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.342190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8003","startPage":"162","endPage":"176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On cosine-modulated wavelet orthonormal bases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On cosine-modulated wavelet orthonormal bases","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4895253","pubMedId":"18289968","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On cosine-modulated wavelet orthonormal bases","sourcePdf":"00342190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055912S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"33","articleId":"342190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":342297,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Bao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Feng Bao","id":"37350282400"},{"name":"N.

However, each time or frequency channel may be reused among several mobiles by means of an antenna array at the base station which points a separate beam at each user. The downlink beamformer would normally operate in an \"open loop\" mode, in which the base steers a mainlobe in the direction of each mobile. Such a system may operate effectively in a free space environment with no multipath. In the presence of scattering, open loop methods will not perform adequately. A new \"closed loop\" technique is presented in which each mobile user feeds back to the base estimates of the received signal amplitudes. Using feedback, the base station can achieve precision beamforming resulting in lower crosstalk and improved signal separation even in the presence of strong scattering environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342304/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4824484","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Base station transmitter antenna arrays with mobile to base feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base station transmitter antenna arrays with mobile to base feedback","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025562S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"20","articleId":"342304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":342306,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Our previous work developed a multiuser detector in which extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimates for user amplitudes and time delays are computed and used in a MAP detector. Importance sampling (IS) has been shown to greatly increase simulation efficiency for a variety of detection problems. In this paper, we describe an IS method which is compatible with our nonlinear time-varying detector. The simulation achieves IS gains on the order of 10/sup 8/, and the implications for computational accuracy are discussed. Simulation results show that the detector greatly outperforms the matched filter detector even under perfect power control, when significant user interference is present.

These techniques offset or stagger the modulation of the in-phase component with respect to the quadrature component of the signal. Examples include minimum shift keying (MSK), Gaussian MSK, offset QPSK, and offset QAM. Conventional equalization designed for QPSK/QAM is suboptimal for staggered modulation because it places unnecessary restrictions on the equalizer output. We derive a new decision feedback equalizer for staggered modulation that takes advantage of the signal's offset modulation nature. Given the channel pulse response, we compute the optimum DFE that minimizes the mean squared error only in the dimension of the modulated symbol, alternating the equalization and decision boundary from symbol to symbol. We show that this new equalizer achieves significant performance gain over conventional DFE structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Digital modulation","Quadrature phase shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Pulse modulation","Digital communication","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum shift keying","phase shift keying","amplitude modulation","equalisers","digital radio systems","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum MMSE equalization","staggered modulation","digital radio transmission","in-phase component","quadrature component","minimum shift keying","MSK","Gaussian MSK","offset QPSK","offset QAM","QPSK/QAM","decision feedback equalizer","offset modulation","channel pulse response","mean squared error minimisation","modulated symbol dimension","decision boundary","performance gain","DFE"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342310","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1406 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342310.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum MMSE equalization for staggered modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum MMSE equalization for staggered modulation","accessionNumber":"4824478","publicationDate":"1993","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum MMSE equalization for staggered modulation","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07248S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"7","articleId":"342310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":342317,"authors":[{"name":"G.F.

These methods are examples of the power of the signal/certainty-philosophy, i.e. the separation of both data and operator into a signal part and a certainty part. Missing data is simply handled by setting the certainty to zero. Localization or 'windowing' of operators is done using an applicability function, the operator equivalent to certainty, not by changing the actual operator coefficients. Spatially or temporally limited operators are handled by setting the applicability function to zero outside the window. The present work shows how false operator responses due to missing or uncertain data can be significantly reduced or eliminated. Perhaps the most well-known of such effects are the various 'edge effects' which invariably occur at the edges of the input data set. Examples of the performance of gradient, divergence and curl operators are given and applications to spectrum analysis is discussed. Further important applications are found in robot vision. Results showing that efficient compensation for camera saccades and elimination of visual responses due to robot arm motions can be attained. The theory is based on linear operations and is general in that it allows for both, data and operators to be scalars, vectors or tensors of higher order.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342325","startPage":"1301","endPage":"1309 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342325.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filtering of uncertain irregularly sampled multidimensional data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Filtering of uncertain irregularly sampled multidimensional data","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4824458","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342325/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filtering of uncertain irregularly sampled multidimensional data","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038996S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"5","articleId":"342325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":342332,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The inverse QR algorithm employs orthogonal rotation operations to update the filter weights thereby preserving the inherent stability properties of the QR method for solving the recursive least squares (RLS) problem. The weight vector for the beamformer is updated in a recursive way while avoiding the highly serial backsubstitution step required in the QR algorithm for solving the RLS estimation problem. Furthermore, the inverse Cholesky factor of the inverse QR algorithm is always a full rank while the Cholesky factor of the direct QR algorithm may be of deficient rank. We have demonstrated the utility of the inverse QR algorithm in constrained (as well as unconstrained) adaptive filtering applications such as adaptive beamforming by modifying the recursive updates required in the algorithm for this application. Simulation results show that the inverse QR algorithm possesses rapid initial convergence typical of RLS-based algorithms and also maintains the long-term stability properties of the orthogonal rotation methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342343","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342343.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342343","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","startPage":"1598","endPage":"1602 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for adaptive beamforming based on an inverse QR decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"A method for adaptive beamforming based on an inverse QR decomposition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342343/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4818349","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for adaptive beamforming based on an inverse QR decomposition","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055387S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","articleId":"342343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":342344,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The theory applies in particular to the detection of weak signals in the presence of interference characterized by a multi-state model. The processing can be accomplished in either the time domain by processing complex samples of the analytical signal or in the frequency domain by processing complex Fourier coefficients. Furthermore, algorithms which process the amplitudes and phases of the samples are derived. These algorithms implement both first and second order detectors (in terms of partial derivatives of the probability density function of the interference).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342344","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342344.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342344","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","startPage":"1594","endPage":"1597 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified theory of adaptive locally optimum processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"A unified theory of adaptive locally optimum processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342344/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4818348","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified theory of adaptive locally optimum processing","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031216S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"9","articleId":"342344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":342347,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We propose a novel technique for robust convolution of two signals under finite precision based on the ideas of DPCM and ESS. The proposed structure is much simpler and more efficient compared to traditional low sensitivity FIR structures. It directly exploits signal correlation and impulse response correlation before quantizing to finite precision. We apply both DPCM and ESS techniques to both the input signal and FIR filter coefficients. By using mean square error (MSE) as a measure of figure of merit, we define the coding gain as the ratio of the MSE in direct convolution to the MSE in the system. We show that the coding gain of the DPCM-ESS convolver is the product of the prediction gain of both the input signal and the filter. The method can be applied to linear phase FIR filters to achieve high coding gain while preserving the advantage of linear phase. Examples show that good filters can be obtained by using low bit multipliers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4818329","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Robust convolution using data-compression schemes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust convolution using data-compression schemes","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0374S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"1","articleId":"342363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":342374,"authors":[{"name":"Ta-Hsin Li","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Texas A and M University, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Ta-Hsin Li","id":"37293054300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-4120-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"342374","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deconvolution","Finite impulse response filter","Sampling methods","Linear systems","Cost function","Noise measurement","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimisation","filtering and prediction theory","discrete systems","linear systems","parameter estimation","Markov processes","statistical analysis","signal processing","digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-valued signals","input signal","linear system","blind deconvolution problem","discreteness","noiseless data","inverse-filtering","minimization","cost function","noisy data","FIR systems","Gibbs sampling approach","posteriors","Markov chain","parametric systems","estimation error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342374","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342374","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","abstract":"The paper shows that when the input signal to a linear system is discrete-valued the blind deconvolution problem of simultaneously estimating the system and recovering the input can be solved more efficiently by taking into account the discreteness of the input signal. Two situations are considered. One deals with noiseless data by an inverse-filtering procedure which minimizes a cost function that measures the discreteness of the output of an inverse filter. For noisy data, observed from FIR systems, the Gibbs sampling approach is employed to simulate the posteriors of the unknowns under the assumption that the input signal is a Markov chain. It is shown that in the noiseless case the method leads to a highly efficient estimator for parametric systems so that the estimation error decays exponentially as the sample size grows. The Gibbs sampling approach also provides rather precise results for noisy data, even if the initial and transition probabilities of the input signal and the variance of the noise are completely unknown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","startPage":"1240","endPage":"1244 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342374.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind deconvolution of discrete-valued signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Blind deconvolution of discrete-valued signals","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4818318","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind deconvolution of discrete-valued signals","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036252S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"5","articleId":"342374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":342383,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Taking a Bayesian approach we define a posterior measure on the parameter space by combining the observed data likelihood with a prior based on airplane dynamics. The Newtonian force equations governing the airplane motion are utilized to form the prior density on the airplane positions. The sampling algorithm based on Jump-diffusion processes, first introduced by Grenander and Miller (1991), is derived for generating high probability estimates of target positions, orientations and types from the posterior measure.

While early wavelet-based algorithms for image compression concentrated on optimal quantization of wavelet coefficients, several recent researchers have proposed approaches which couple coefficient quantization (either scalar or vector-based) with various strategies for quantizing the tree itself. This paper proposes an image compression algorithm based on optimal bit rate allocation between scalar and tree-structured quantizers. A predictive approach to representing the pruned tree structure is presented, and the entropy of this representation is included in the optimal allocation problem. The algorithm couples Lagrangian optimization of scalar quantizers with a marginal analysis approach for optimizing the tree structure, and achieves excellent coding efficiency in the rate-distortion sense.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342441","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342441","startPage":"891","endPage":"895 vol.2","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342441.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342441/","displayDocTitle":"Joint optimization of scalar and tree-structured quantization of wavelet image decompositions","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4818251","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint optimization of scalar and tree-structured quantization of wavelet image decompositions","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038207S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"31","articleId":"342441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":342465,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

This is due to its important applications in sampling structure conversion, e.g., the conversion between conventional television signals and high definition television (HDTV) signals. Among many other results, one useful test for such commutativity was found to be that the two matrices which define the multidimensional downsampling and upsampling should be commutative and coprime. However, the problem of finding multidimensional downsamplers and upsamplers that satisfy these conditions has remained open. In this paper, we develop a systematic procedure to solve this open problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342472","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342472.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"74 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On commutativity of multidimensional downsamplers and upsamplers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"On commutativity of multidimensional downsamplers and upsamplers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4846199","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342472/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On commutativity of multidimensional downsamplers and upsamplers","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044219S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","articleId":"342472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":342524,"authors":[{"name":"F.P.

In these problems the number of potentially active sources is greater than the number of observations. In many situations, it is desirable to find a minimal source solution. This can be accomplished by minimizing a cost function that accounts for both the compatibility of the solution with the observations and for its \"sparseness\". Minimizing functions of this form can be a difficult optimization problem. Genetic algorithms are a relatively new and robust approach to the solution of difficult optimization problems, providing a global framework that is not dependent on local continuity or on explicit starting values. We describe the use of genetic algorithms to find minimal source solutions, using as an example a simulation inspired by the reconstruction of neural currents in the human brain from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342529","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342529.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"338 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms for minimal source reconstructions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms for minimal source reconstructions","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4846250","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms for minimal source reconstructions","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073717S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"1","articleId":"342529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":342530,"authors":[{"name":"I.F.

Since a neural network edge detector is a nonlinear filter, it can have a built-in thresholding capability. Thus the filtering, thresholding operation of edge detection is a natural application for neural network processing. An edge-detection neural network can be trained with backpropagation using relatively few training patterns. The most difficult part of any neural network training problem is defining the proper training set. A simple method is given for the edge detection training problem. Not only can neural networks be trained to detect edges, they can also be designed from scratch, without the necessity for training. The weights of the network can be selected to match the characteristics of your favorite linear edge detection filter. The addition of a bias, and a sigmoid non-linearity on the output produces an \"engineered\" neural network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342541","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342541.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"395 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge detection using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Edge detection using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4846261","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge detection using neural networks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033265S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"12","articleId":"342541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":342542,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Unfortunately, most nonlinear equalizers are usually too complicated to meet real-time processing demands. Neural networks offer a computationally-efficient alternative to currently-used nonlinear filter realizations. However, because the backpropagation training algorithm of MLP is a generalized LMS algorithm, it suffers the same problem as the linear LMS, i.e., slow convergence. We introduce two techniques to improve the performance of MLP equalizers. One is based on the normalization of the adaptation term to the derivative of the output activation function, the other is using the pre-orthogonalization technique.

There are two basic ideas explored in the paper. First is the idea of real time training. The second idea is to pass the desired signal through the same number and form of nonlinearities as the data encounters as it passes from the input layer through intermediate layers to the output. This is compared with the traditional method of training at the output layer with a desired signal that is linear with the input signal. The comparison are made on a low order feedforward backpropagation networks. The outputs of the input and intermediate layers are passed through logistic nonlinearities. Thus, in the functional mapping cases, the desired signal is passed through a logistic function twice.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342546","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342546.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"415 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional mapping of desired signals for improved performance of fully dynamic, feedforward supervised neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Functional mapping of desired signals for improved performance of fully dynamic, feedforward supervised neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4846265","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional mapping of desired signals for improved performance of fully dynamic, feedforward supervised neural networks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029812S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"1","articleId":"342546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":342548,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The encoder structure is a multiple level free structure that corresponds to a conventional uniform scalar quantizer. The decoder structure is a multiple stage direct sum structure. The uniform quantizer encoder structure is matched to the dynamic range of the source output. The decoder direct sum structure is jointly optimized for the source probability density function and the fixed partition of the uniform quantizer encoder. The bit stream generated by the encoder can be decoded either by the standard uniform quantizer decoder, or by the generalized nonuniform direct sum decoder described. Successive approximation multiple stage scalar quantizers with both standard and generalized decoders are tested on image wavelet transform coefficients. The generalized codes give approximately 0/spl sim/7 dB improvements over standard codes for one to eight bit representations of real-valued wavelet coefficients.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342572","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342572.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","startPage":"533","endPage":"537 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successive approximation quantization with generalized decoding for wavelet transform image coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Successive approximation quantization with generalized decoding for wavelet transform image coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342572/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4851100","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive approximation quantization with generalized decoding for wavelet transform image coding","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029036S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"6","articleId":"342572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":342592,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The objective throughout the paper is to establish finite-length analogs of the well known infinite-length MMSE-DFE results.

Inherent in this structure is the need to do quadrature processing to eliminate images that occur due to the up-sampling required to obtain the narrow-band bandpass filters. We propose to use parallel processors (microprocessors, ASICs, or DSP chips) to implement complex FIR filters needed to eliminate the upsampled images. The processors implement a very simple complex FIR filter in one modulus of a generalized quadratic residue number system (GQRNS). By keeping the moduli small and the filter order low, it is possible to use standard binary within the processor to implement a GQRNS number system. This allows us to obtain the advantages of parallel processing and simplified complex number arithmetic inherent in GQRNS arithmetic while maintaining standard binary arithmetic in the processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band pass filters","Narrowband","Finite impulse response filter","Arithmetic","Interference elimination","Decoding","Spread spectrum communication","Binary phase shift keying","Image reconstruction","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","FIR filters","application specific integrated circuits","band-pass filters","decoding","adaptive signal processing","spread spectrum communication","residue number systems","digital filters","interference suppression","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-rate bandpass filter bank","QRNS complex arithmetic","parallel multiple DSP chips","ASICs","decoding","spread-spectrum BPSK signals","narrow-band interference","perfect reconstruction","very simple adaptive algorithm","narrow-band interference broadband signals","quadrature processing","image elimination","up-sampling","narrow-band bandpass filters","parallel processors","microprocessors","complex FIR filters","generalized quadratic residue number system","standard binary","parallel processing","simplified complex number arithmetic","GQRNS arithmetic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342632","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/922/8008/00342632.pdf","startPage":"801","endPage":"806 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-rate bandpass filter bank implemented in QRNS complex arithmetic using parallel multiple DSP chips or ASICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-rate bandpass filter bank implemented in QRNS complex arithmetic using parallel multiple DSP chips or ASICs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342632/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4851154","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-rate bandpass filter bank implemented in QRNS complex arithmetic using parallel multiple DSP chips or ASICs","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00342632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065342S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"922","citationCount":"1","articleId":"342632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":342636,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Chul Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ki-Chul Kim","id":"37087258290"},{"name":"Il-Song Han","affiliation":["Korea Telecom Research Center, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Il-Song Han","id":"37087250685"},{"name":"Jun-Hee Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jun-Hee Lee","id":"37087155408"},{"name":"Hwang-Soo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hwang-Soo Lee","id":"37087220095"},{"name":"Y.N.

In this paper, we derive an idealised scheduling analysis for the CAN real-time bus, and then study two actual interface chips to see how the analysis can be applied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1994.342710","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/1004/8010/00342710.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1994.342710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010","startPage":"259","endPage":"263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysing real-time communications: controller area network (CAN)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysing real-time communications: controller area network (CAN)","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342710/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4829945","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysing real-time communications: controller area network (CAN)","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00342710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087785S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1004","citationCount":"224","articleId":"342710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":342714,"authors":[{"name":"Di Natale","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'' Anna, Pisa, Italy","Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Di Natale","id":"37354993800"},{"name":"Stankovic","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Stankovic","id":"37279446200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6600-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"342714","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":98,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling","Complexity theory","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["processor scheduling","communication complexity","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic end-to-end guarantees","distributed real time systems","synchronous channels","synchronous communications","remote tasks","local tasks","NP complete","future arrival times","dynamic scheduling","synchronous primitives","online scheduling","off-line scheduling","communication constraints","precedence constraints","pseudo-deadlines","end-to-end scheduling","reflective memory","distributed architecture"]}],"abstract":"Many distributed real-time applications are structured as a set of processes communicating through synchronous channels. Unfortunately, process interactions and especially synchronous communications make the problem of predictably scheduling the tasks more complex. In distributed systems the local and remote tasks as well as the messages over the network must be properly scheduled and synchronized to meet the deadlines of the application. To find such a, schedule is not an easy task, in fact, this problem is NP complete even if one has complete knowledge of the future arrival times for all the processes in the system. The objective of this paper is to develop a scheme that allows for the dynamic scheduling and guaranteeing of distributed processes communicating via synchronous primitives. For efficiency reasons a combination of off-line and on-line scheduling is performed. Precedence and communication constraints are converted off-line into pseudo-deadlines for each task, enabling efficient on-line processing. The on-line scheduling operates in parallel at the sites involved in the distributed computation, further obtaining efficiency. The overall end-to-end scheduling includes the joint and coordinated scheduling of tasks and messages in a reflective memory distributed architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1994.342714","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/1004/8010/00342714.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1994.342714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic end-to-end guarantees in distributed real time systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342714/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic end-to-end guarantees in distributed real time systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4829941","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic end-to-end guarantees in distributed real time systems","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00342714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047204S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1004","citationCount":"98","articleId":"342714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":342716,"authors":[{"name":"Gerber","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Gerber","id":"37381246600"},{"name":"Hong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Hong","id":"37291724800"},{"name":"Saksena","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Saksena","id":"37354252600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6600-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"342716","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Optimization methods","Calibration","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing","optimisation","calibration","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end-to-end timing constraints","intermediate process calibration","design methodology","real-time systems","asynchronous channels","external inputs","external outputs","end-to-end propagation delay","temporal input-sampling correlation","separation times","updated output values","automated design method","intermediate rate constraints","related input correlation","optimization algorithm","CPU utilization minimization","restructuring tool","bottlenecks","assignment algorithm","schedulable, fully periodic tasks","collaborative constraint maintenance"]}],"abstract":"Presents a comprehensive design methodology for guaranteeing end-to-end requirements of real-time systems. Applications are structured as a set of process components connected by asynchronous channels, in which the endpoints are the system's external inputs and outputs. Timing constraints are then postulated between these inputs and outputs, they express properties such as end-to-end propagation delay, temporal input-sampling correlation, and allowable separation times between updated output values. The automated design method works as follows. First the end-to-end requirements are transformed into a set of intermediate rate constraints on the tasks, and new tasks are created to correlate related inputs. The intermediate constraints are then solved by an optimization algorithm, whose objective is to minimize CPU utilization. If the algorithm fails, a restructuring tool attempts to eliminate bottlenecks by transforming the application, which is then re-submitted into the assignment algorithm. The final result is a schedulable set of fully periodic tasks, which collaboratively maintain the end-to-end constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guaranteeing end-to-end timing constraints by calibrating intermediate processes","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1994.342716","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/1004/8010/00342716.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1994.342716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Guaranteeing end-to-end timing constraints by calibrating intermediate processes","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4829939","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guaranteeing end-to-end timing constraints by calibrating intermediate processes","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00342716.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038087S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1004","citationCount":"69","articleId":"342716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":342726,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Soo Lim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Soo Lim","id":"37367378500"},{"name":"Young Hyun Bae","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young Hyun Bae","id":"37655389200"},{"name":"Gyu Tae Jang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gyu Tae Jang","id":"37649830300"},{"name":"Byung-Do Rhee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byung-Do Rhee","id":"37377776700"},{"name":"Sang Lyul Min","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Lyul Min","id":"37278276500"},{"name":"Chang Yun Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chang Yun Park","id":"37383407300"},{"name":"Heonshik Shin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Heonshik Shin","id":"37287622500"},{"name":"Kunsoo Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kunsoo Park","id":"37337219800"},{"name":"Choug Sang Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Choug Sang Kim","id":"37336297200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6600-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"342726","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Pipeline processing","Cache memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing","reduced instruction set computing","pipeline processing","cache storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["worst case timing analysis","RISC processors","timing analysis","pipelined execution","cache memory","Worst Case Timing Abstraction"]}],"abstract":"An accurate and safe estimation of a task's worst case execution time (WCET) is crucial for reasoning about the timing properties of real-time systems. In RISC processors, the execution time of a program construct (e.g., a statement) is affected by various factors such as cache hits/misses and pipeline hazards, and these factors impose serious problems in analyzing the WCETs of tasks. To analyze the timing effects of RISC's pipelined execution and cache memory, this paper proposes extensions of the original timing schema (Shaw, 1989) where the timing information associated with each program construct is a simple time-bound. We associate with each program construct what we call a WCTA (Worst Case Timing Abstraction), which contains detailed timing information of every execution path that might be the worst case execution path of the program construct. This extension leads to a revised timing schema that is similar to the original timing schema except that concatenation and pruning operations on WCTAs are newly defined to replace the add and max operations on time-bounds in the original timing schema. Our revised timing schema accurately accounts for the timing effects of pipelined execution and cache memory not only within but also across program constructs. This paper also reports on preliminary results of WCET analyses for a pipelined processor. Our results show that up to 50% tighter WCET bounds can be obtained by using the revised timing schema.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An accurate worst case timing analysis technique for RISC processors","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1994.342726","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/1004/8010/00342726.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1994.342726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=342726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"An accurate worst case timing analysis technique for RISC processors","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4829929","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An accurate worst case timing analysis technique for RISC processors","confLoc":"San Juan, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"00342726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042043S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1004","citationCount":"45","articleId":"342726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":342920,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

Four different types of jets were used, all of them employing a single 0.50 mm diameter orifice. A fixed position jet impingement pin with the orifice centered on a flat face measuring 7.62 mm on an edge was used as a base case. This jet supported a heat flux of about 120 W/cm/sup 2/ at a reasonable flowrate. Variable position jet impingement pistons were shown to perform as well as, but no better than the base case. Additional tests were conducted to investigate performance with variation in the chip-to-orifice gap. Thermal performance was found to be insensitive to the gap at large spacing, but below some specific gap it degraded with decreasing gap. A sudden jump in the chip temperature was discovered to occur at a specific gap.

We consider 2- and 3- valued Hopfield models to describe basic gates such as AND, OR, NAND, NOR and XOR. These gate models, in turn, transform the structural behavior of a logic circuit into an analogous neural network (NN) model. The test generation problem is then formulated as an energy minimization problem of a NN model for which techniques such as gradient descent and simulated annealing can be used. In order to develop a test set we have used the concepts of simulated annealing and the topological search proposed in the path oriented decision making (PODEM) algorithm. An error correction and translation (ECAT) circuit is used to illustrate the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/342975/","accessionNumber":"4839719","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"NEUDEM: neural network based decision making for generating tests in digital circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NEUDEM: neural network based decision making for generating tests in digital circuits","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00342975.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084844S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug 1993","isNumber":"8013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1096","articleId":"342975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":342976,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

The problem discussed in this paper is to identify a distributed computing environment that best optimizes the objective function for the given problem. Distinct network permutations may result in equivalent process permutation depending upon the mapping of processes onto the processors. In this paper we study the permuting properties of dynamic interconnection networks taking process mapping into consideration. A uniform group theoretic representation for interconnection networks is developed. Finally, an algorithm to evaluate the number of passes required by an interconnection network to realize a given mapping is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1993.343064","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 36th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 36th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/1096/8013/00343064.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1993.343064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8013","startPage":"323","endPage":"326 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping algorithms for permutation networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=343064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mapping algorithms for permutation networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/343064/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4839650","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping algorithms for permutation networks","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00343064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042244S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug 1993","isNumber":"8013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1096","articleId":"343064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":343072,"authors":[{"name":"E.

However, the minimum-order augmentation technique provided improved computational complexity by minimizing superfluous poles, at the expense of increased transfer function denominator multipliers. In this paper, we show that for many realizations there exist stable time-domain pipelined IIR filters with computational complexity far less than the z-domain pipelined IIR filters. The decreased complexity in time-domain pipelined IIR filters results from the occurrence of \"stability pockets\" which allow stable pipeline IIR filters with far fewer superfluous poles than predicted by the stability analyses previously performed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1993.343186","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 36th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 36th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/1096/8013/00343186.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"783 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1993.343186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Stability of IIR digital filters constructed with the time-domain pipelining technique","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4846798","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/343186/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of IIR digital filters constructed with the time-domain pipelining technique","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00343186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036386S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug 1993","isNumber":"8013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1096","citationCount":"5","articleId":"343186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":343189,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

By using this algorithm, the obtained network has continuous valued weights at the first layer and single-term powers-of-two valued weights at the second layer such that no multiplications are needed in the computation after training. On the other hand, step function is used at the output layer and a simplified version of sigmoid function is used at the hidden layer as activation functions which simplifies digital hardware implementation further. Simulation results showed that such networks can retain nearly identical recall performance of the corresponding networks using continuous weights, while having increased computational speed in applications and reduced cost in digital hardware implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1993.343273","startPage":"1085","endPage":"1088 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 36th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1993.343273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8013","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 36th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/1096/8013/00343273.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiplierless multilayer feedforward neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/343273/","displayDocTitle":"Multiplierless multilayer feedforward neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4846860","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiplierless multilayer feedforward neural networks","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00343273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037781S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug 1993","isNumber":"8013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1096","citationCount":"1","articleId":"343273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":343274,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

Three of them including the look-ahead bit-line equalizing and precharging method, the divided-word-line method, and the sense amplifier output and data bus equalizing method are used to gain speed and reduce power dissipation.

By observing the difference between the reference torque and the output torque based on a prescribed model, the proposed disturbance observer immediately feeds back the discrepancy to filter off the disturbance. In this way each robot joint becomes linearized and decoupled and a simple PD with feedforward control is sufficient to achieve high accuracy trajectory tracking. A particular advantage in this observer implementation is that only position and velocity signals are required for control purposes. The observer also provides an estimation of external reaction force which is useful in deciding whether a particular threshold level has been exceeded as an indication of jam. This duality in functionality eliminates a force sensor to detect external force. Experiments are carried out on a SCARA robot to verify the accuracy of the overall controller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/343382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug 1993","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4852121","displayDocTitle":"A joint torque disturbance observer for robotic assembly","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint torque disturbance observer for robotic assembly","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00343382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04939S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug 1993","isNumber":"8013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1096","citationCount":"8","articleId":"343382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":343395,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

This paper discusses the consideration between a new feeder and a retrofit kit and then focuses on weighing feeder retrofit kits. This focus includes an overview of typically required components, a discussion of application considerations and a more detailed discussion of important components.

Difficulties arise when a solution requires memory in such applications as speech processing, seismic signal processing, language processing, or spatiotemporal signal processing. For such applications, the outputs are not only functions of the present inputs but of the present states (or the past inputs and outputs) as well. Fuzzy finite state machines (FFSMs) can be effectively used in these applications. The aim of this study is to show that a FFSM can be realized using a neural fuzzy system (called NeuFuz). In a FFSM, the output and the next state depend on the input and the present state, which in turn is a function of the previous inputs. To accommodate the memory requirement, the feedforward structure of the neural fuzzy system is changed to a recurrent architecture by adding a feedback loop from the output layer to the input layer during the recall mode. The validity of the approach is verified with a temporal pattern-matching experiment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Automata","Fuzzy sets","Artificial neural networks","Signal processing","Feedback loop","Embedded system","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite state machines","fuzzy neural nets","pattern matching","feedforward neural nets","recurrent neural nets","feedback","fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy finite state machine","neural fuzzy system","feedforward neural network","NeuFuz","memory requirement","recurrent architecture","feedback loop","recall mode","temporal pattern-matching"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343592","startPage":"1749","endPage":"1754 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 3rd International Fuzzy Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 3rd International Fuzzy Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/1124/8016/00343592.pdf","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy finite state machine implementation based on a neural fuzzy system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy finite state machine implementation based on a neural fuzzy system","accessionNumber":"4840495","publicationDate":"1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/343592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy finite state machine implementation based on a neural fuzzy system","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00343592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020727S","chronDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1124","citationCount":"16","articleId":"343592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":343598,"authors":[{"name":"Kim Chwee Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"lastName":"Kim Chwee Ng","id":"38256937300"},{"name":"Yun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"lastName":"Yun Li","id":"37336372600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1896-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"343598","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":323},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of sophisticated fuzzy logic controllers using genetic algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=343598","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Automatic control","Fuzzy control","Control systems","Error correction","Control nonlinearities","Proportional control","Design optimization","Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","control system synthesis","genetic algorithms","level control","two-term control","control nonlinearities","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic controller design","genetic algorithms","optimized membership functions","fuzzy rule base","automatic design","nonlinearities","controller design space","base-7 strings","chromosomes","bit matching","discrete fuzzy values","proportional-plus-integral controller","nonlinear water level control system","performance","PID controller","proportional-plus-derivative controller","steady-state error"]}],"abstract":"The design of fuzzy logic controllers encounters difficulties in the selection of optimized membership functions and a fuzzy rule base, which is traditionally achieved by a tedious trial-and error process. This paper develops genetic algorithms for the automatic design of high-performance fuzzy logic controllers using sophisticated membership functions that intrinsically reflect the nonlinearities encountered in many engineering control applications. The controller design space is coded in base-7 strings (chromosomes), where each bit (gene) matches the 7 discrete fuzzy values. The developed approach is subsequently applied to the design of a proportional-plus-integral type fuzzy controller for a nonlinear water level control system. The performance of this control system is demonstrated to be higher than that of a conventional PID controller. For further comparison, a fuzzy proportional-plus-derivative controller is also developed using this approach, the response of which is shown to present no steady-state error.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343598","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 3rd International Fuzzy Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 3rd International Fuzzy Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/1124/8016/00343598.pdf","startPage":"1708","endPage":"1712 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/343598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Design of sophisticated fuzzy logic controllers using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 1994","accessionNumber":"4840489","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of sophisticated fuzzy logic controllers using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00343598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105277S","chronDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1124","citationCount":"13","articleId":"343598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":343611,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Generally, the design of FLSs involves determination of the number of fuzzy rules, the structure of the rules, and membership function parameters. Most techniques treat these parts separately, which may result in a suboptimal solution. We propose to optimize all three parts simultaneously using genetic algorithm (GA) techniques. While GAs are very robust with respect to avoiding local minima, they can be slow in refining the solution once near the optimum. Thus, the FLS obtained from GA search is further fine-tuned using a conjugate gradient method. The advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated through a comparison with other fuzzy modeling techniques and feedforward neural networks on modeling a nonlinear dynamic system, and industrial process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343611","pdfPath":"/iel2/1124/8016/00343611.pdf","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1382 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 3rd International Fuzzy Systems Conference","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 3rd International Fuzzy Systems Conference","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00343611.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complete design of fuzzy logic systems using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/343611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Complete design of fuzzy logic systems using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4840470","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complete design of fuzzy logic systems using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00343611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032877S","chronDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1124","citationCount":"46","articleId":"343611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":343619,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

In contrast to prior genetic-fuzzy systems which require that every input combination be enumerated, we employ a novel encoding scheme which maintains only those rules necessary to control the target system.

This compact rule base methodology, introduced by Cooper and Vidal (1993) to generate a controller for the cart and single-pole problem, is applied to the more complex cart and jointed-pole problem. By using a compact rule base representation, successful systems evolve quickly, increasing the likelihood of success when applied to complex problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic design of fuzzy controllers: the cart and jointed-pole problem","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343619","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1337 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8016","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 3rd International Fuzzy Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 3rd International Fuzzy Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/1124/8016/00343619.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=343619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/343619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Genetic design of fuzzy controllers: the cart and jointed-pole problem","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4840462","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic design of fuzzy controllers: the cart and jointed-pole problem","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00343619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025979S","chronDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1124","citationCount":"28","articleId":"343619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":343628,"authors":[{"name":"Ray-I Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ray-I Chang","id":"37288782200"},{"name":"Pei-Yung Hsiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pei-Yung Hsiao","id":"37266631800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1896-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"343628","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Timing","Neural networks","Wire","Fuzzy logic","Circuits","Delay estimation","Parallel architectures","Information science","Chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","neural chips","fuzzy logic","optimisation","fuzzy set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy-neuro approach","timing-driven system partitioning","VLSI multi-chip design","VLSI system partitioning problem","expert knowledge","fuzzy logic rules","multi-objective optimization","neural networks","Hopfield-type network"]}],"abstract":"A contemporary definition of the VLSI system partitioning problem is characterized by multiple contradictory objectives to minimize connection wires while satisfying timing and capacity constraints.

In this paper, a fuzzy-neuro approach which models expert knowledge as fuzzy logic rules is proposed to govern the multi-objective optimization process of neural networks.

Of the feasible solutions, at present, fuzzy logic RISC processors and fuzzy logic finite state machines (ASIC) seem to be most promising. The latter approach is taken into consideration. In this paper the model of the fuzzy-state-fuzzy-output (FSFO) finite state machine (FSM) is discussed in detail. The state membership function (SMF) is introduced and the FSFO FSM implementation by means of crisp-state-fuzzy-output (CSFO) FSM using SMF is proposed.

In this paper, we focus on the effectiveness of GAs to optimize the fuzzification step in the fuzzy rule generation method of Wang-Mendel (1991). The method generates a fuzzy rule base from a set of numerical training data organizing it into a fuzzy associative-memory (FAM) bank, and produces a mapping from input space to output space based on the FAM bank using a defuzzifying procedure. The fuzzification step in the method partitions both the input and output spaces into fuzzy regions. Results show that by optimizing the membership functions via GAs, the total error between desired output data and defuzzified output data can be reduced by as much as 50%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343733","startPage":"509","endPage":"513 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 3rd International Fuzzy Systems Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1994.343733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8016","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 3rd International Fuzzy Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/1124/8016/00343733.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy associative memory optimization using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/343733/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy associative memory optimization using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4829214","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy associative memory optimization using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00343733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035146S","chronDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1124","citationCount":"1","articleId":"343733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":343735,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This technique has the following merits: (1) As long as we have the map information, we can control a truck to the goal point. (2) We can consider the operator's technique because of using fuzzy logic for a vehicle control. (3) The control method is very simple.

We present how heuristic preprocessing and quality measures are used for appropriate parameter selection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/343943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4847386","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 1994","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Defuzzification based on fuzzy clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defuzzification based on fuzzy clustering","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00343943.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054029S","chronDate":"26-29 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1124","citationCount":"5","articleId":"343943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":344012,"authors":[{"name":"R.Y.

Although, Gauss-Seidel algorithms are inherently sequential, by performing specialized orderings on sparse matrices, it is possible to eliminate much of the data dependencies caused by precedence in the calculations. A two-part matrix ordering technique has been developed-first to partition the matrix into block-diagonal-bordered form using diakoptic techniques and then to multi-color the data in the last diagonal block using graph coloring techniques. The ordered matrices often have extensive parallelism, while maintaining the strict precedence relationships in the Gauss-Seidel algorithm. We present timing results for a parallel Gauss-Seidel solver implemented on the Thinking Machines CM-5 distributed memory multi-processor. The algorithm presented here requires active message remote procedure calls in order to minimize communications overhead and obtain good relative speedup.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344278","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '94:Proceedings of the 1994 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","startPage":"184","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8021","pdfPath":"/iel2/1005/8021/00344278.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '94:Proceedings of the 1994 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian processes","Power systems","Sparse matrices","Transmission line matrix methods","Power system interconnection","Gaussian distribution","Equations","Concurrent computing","Information science","Parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph colouring","sparse matrices","iterative methods","parallel algorithms","remote procedure calls","distributed memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel Gauss-Seidel algorithm","sparse power system matrices","irregular sparse matrices","electrical power systems applications","data dependencies","two-part matrix ordering technique","matrix partitioning","diakoptic techniques","graph coloring techniques","strict precedence relationships","Thinking Machines CM-5","distributed memory multiprocessor","active message remote procedure calls"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A parallel Gauss-Seidel algorithm for sparse power system matrices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344278/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4847457","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel Gauss-Seidel algorithm for sparse power system matrices","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00344278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038417S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1005","citationCount":"14","articleId":"344278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":344297,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The message-passing programming model is widely used because of its portability, yet some applications are too complex to code in it while also trying to maintain a balanced computation load and avoid redundant computations. The shared-memory programming model simplifies coding, but it is not portable and often provides little control over interprocessor data transfer costs. This paper describes a new approach, called Global Arrays (GA) that combines the better features of both other models, leading to both simple coding and efficient execution. The key concept of GA is that it provides a portable interface through which each process in a MIMD parallel program can asynchronously access logical blocks of physically distributed matrices, with no need for explicit cooperation by other processes. We have implemented GA libraries on a variety of computer systems, including the Intel DELTA and Paragon, the IBM SP-1 (all message-passers), the Kendall Square KSR-2 (a nonuniform access shared-memory machine), and networks of Unix workstations. We discuss the design and implementation of these libraries, report their performance, illustrate the use of GA in the context of computational chemistry applications, and describe the use of a GA performance visualization tool.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Arrays: a portable \"shared-memory\" programming model for distributed memory computers","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '94:Proceedings of the 1994 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344297","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '94:Proceedings of the 1994 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1005/8021/00344297.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8021","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Global Arrays: a portable \"shared-memory\" programming model for distributed memory computers","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4847474","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Arrays: a portable \"shared-memory\" programming model for distributed memory computers","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00344297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03033S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1005","citationCount":"33","articleId":"344297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":344301,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In N-body simulations, most of the computing time is spent to calculate the force between particles, since the number of interactions is proportional to the square of the number of particles. For many problems the accuracy of fast algorithms such as the particle-mesh scheme is not sufficient and we have to use the straightforward direct summation. In order to accelerate the force calculation, we have developed a series of hardware, the GRAPE (Gravity Pipe) systems. The basic idea of our GRAPE systems is to develop a hardware specialized for the force calculation. The rest of the calculation is performed on the general-purpose computer connected to GRAPE. The GRAPE-4 system is our newest hardware, scheduled to be completed in early 1995. Planned peak speed is 1.15 Tflops. This speed is achieved by running 1920 pipeline LSIs, each provides 600 Mflops, in parallel. A prototype system has been completed July 1994, and the full system is now under manufacturing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344306/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4847483","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"GRAPE 4: a one-Tflops special-purpose computer for astrophysical N-body problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GRAPE 4: a one-Tflops special-purpose computer for astrophysical N-body problem","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00344306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079475S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1005","citationCount":"5","articleId":"344306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":344308,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We also extend our algorithm to incremental graph partitioning problems, in which the graph structure or system properties changes with time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344308","pdfPath":"/iel2/1005/8021/00344308.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"457","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '94:Proceedings of the 1994 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '94:Proceedings of the 1994 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms for graph partitioning and incremental graph partitioning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms for graph partitioning and incremental graph partitioning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4847485","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms for graph partitioning and incremental graph partitioning","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00344308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036591S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1005","citationCount":"8","articleId":"344308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":344309,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Wei Ou","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Chao-Wei Ou","id":"37343467100"},{"name":"S.

For instance, efficiently parallelizing several scientific and engineering applications requires the partitioning of data or tasks among processors such that the computational load on each node is roughly the same, while communication is minimized. Obtaining exact solutions is computationally intractable, since graph-partitioning is an NP-complete. For a large class of irregular and adaptive data parallel applications (such as adaptive meshes), the computational structure changes from one phase to another in an incremental fashion. In incremental graph-partitioning problems the partitioning of the graph needs to be updated as the graph changes over time; a small number of nodes or edges may be added or deleted at any given instant. We use a linear programming-based method to solve the incremental graph partitioning problem. All the steps used by our method are inherently parallel and hence our approach can be easily parallelized. By using an initial solution for the graph partitions derived from recursive spectral bisection-based methods, our methods can achieve repartitioning at considerably lower cost than can be obtained by applying recursive spectral bisection from scratch.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344309","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '94:Proceedings of the 1994 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '94:Proceedings of the 1994 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1005/8021/00344309.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel incremental graph partitioning using linear programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344309/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel incremental graph partitioning using linear programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4847486","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel incremental graph partitioning using linear programming","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00344309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043462S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1005","citationCount":"4","articleId":"344309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":344326,"authors":[{"name":"R.

UNIX based environments, such as IBM's AIX, furnishes such an operating environment while providing efficient uni-processor utilization for user code execution. When these machines are interconnected with a low latency (user space) communication mechanism, large variances in point to point communication times for identical parallel programs are typically found. It is our contention that a large part of this variance is introduced by operating system support functionality that can delay point to point user space communications. We are able to experimentally measure this effect by monitoring the change in time of circulating a token through parallel processors connected in a virtual ring configuration. This paper proposed some solutions and then experimentally validates their ability to reduce point to point message passing variance for the IBM 9076 (SP1) machines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8021","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '94:Proceedings of the 1994 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '94:Proceedings of the 1994 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel2/1005/8021/00344326.pdf","endPage":"629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the variance of point to point transfers in the IBM 9076 parallel computer","doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1994.344326","startPage":"620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the variance of point to point transfers in the IBM 9076 parallel computer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344326/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4847500","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the variance of point to point transfers in the IBM 9076 parallel computer","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00344326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046128S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1005","citationCount":"8","articleId":"344326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":344455,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The authors consider the problem of deciding which logical connections should be formed among satellites out of all the possible connections that can be made depending on the line-of-sight (LOS) visibility of satellites. These logical connections can be decided to meet various objectives of the underlying network. The objective functions can be maximizing the number of links formed, thus, maximizing the transceiver utilization, maximizing network connectivity, minimizing link re-targeting, or minimizing average distance between nodes. Here, the satellite networks are assumed to be independent from intervention by ground stations. Hence, the decisions made should be autonomous. Another assumption is that all the computations and decisions made are either aperiodic or the input to computation is too unpredictable to be precomputed. Various approaches to link assignment with different objective functions and algorithms for some specific functions are described.

The investigation is the basis for retrieval and management of human face images stored in the database. The database is similar to FBI or many other law enforcement agencies databases. The goal of the investigation is twofold. First, assuming that an existing database of the front face and profile images is available, the requirement is to know whether the neural network trained on the front image and the profile can recognize any other images of the same person. Second, a minimal set of snapshots of each person is desired consisting of at least the front face and profile, which are needed to train a neural network so that the trained network can then recognize many other snapshots of the same person. The research prototype of a postrelational database management system (DBMs) is discussed called CHINOOK being implemented at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.

In addition, speed improvements of silicon technology enable internal microprocessor clocking at a faster rate than the external bus. In this paper a fully-integrated delay line loop (DLL) clock generator circuit is used to perform frequency synthesis multiplication by N(f/sub CLK/=N/spl middot/f/sub XCLK/) of a de-skewed 50% duty-cycle CLK. The DLL offers mostly-digital implementation of an analog function with robustness and simplicity. The first version of the DLL was fully integrated on a RISC microprocessor chip and, later, on a cache-controller chip.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344633.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"299","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A delay line loop for frequency synthesis of de-skewed clock","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay lines","Frequency locked loops","Frequency synthesizers","Clocks","Signal synthesis","Microprocessors","Signal generators","Silicon","Integrated circuit synthesis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","frequency synthesizers","delay lines","microprocessor chips","frequency multipliers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay line loop","system clock","de-skewed clock","internal clock signal","silicon technology","clock generator circuit","frequency synthesis multiplication","duty-cycle","digital implementation","analog function","RISC microprocessor chip","cache-controller chip","50 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","displayDocTitle":"A delay line loop for frequency synthesis of de-skewed clock","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817630","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A delay line loop for frequency synthesis of de-skewed clock","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032435S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"38","articleId":"344633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":344637,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Moreover, data association and classification according to the degree of association can also be performed at the memory-cell level without any software manipulation. The implementation of such intelligent functions by a memory cell has been facilitated by unique circuit configurations of the neuron MOS (vMOS) transistor, a multi-functional device that simulates the action of biological neurons. These concepts are experimentally verified by test devices fabricated by a standard double-polysilicon CMOS process. Although the circuits are explained for a 4-valued system, the designs can be extended to an 8-valued (or greater) system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data processing","Random access memory","Neurons","Read-write memory","Software performance","Cells (biology)","MOSFETs","Biological system modeling","Circuit simulation","Circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-access storage","neural chips","CMOS integrated circuits","analogue-digital conversion","content-addressable storage","integrated memory circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuron MOS transistor","multi-functional device","RAM","quantization","analog data","intelligent data processing","data association","data classification","circuit configurations","double-polysilicon CMOS process","memory-cell","multi-valued data","Si"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344645","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344645","startPage":"270","endPage":"351","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344645.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344645/","displayDocTitle":"Neuron-MOS multiple-valued memory technology for intelligent data processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4817618","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuron-MOS multiple-valued memory technology for intelligent data processing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024825S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"8","articleId":"344645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":344646,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Although GaAs MESFET technology has superior noise performance compared to silicon technology for transimpedance amplifiers, this has not been fully exploited. Low voltage gain, which leads to a small feedback resistor, and the use of numerous active devices that have significant channel noise degrades the noise performance of many designs. Silicon bipolar transimpedance amplifiers suffer from poor sensitivity because of the shot noise produced by the base current, and from the thermal noise produced by a low-value feedback resistor. A low-value feedback resistor can result from the parasitic capacitance associated with implanted or thin-film resistors, and the lossy silicon substrate. This parasitic capacitance lowers the bandwidth because it exists in the feedback path with the feedback resistor and/or because it degrades stability. GaAs MESFET technology, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because of the semi-insulating substrate. The challenge for GaAs MESFET technology is to produce adequate voltage gain in spite of the low inherent gain of short-channel MESFETs without degrading noise performance or stability. The circuit described here meets these requirements and achieves an average input-referred noise current of <2pAspl radic/Hz over 500 MHz bandwidth. Self-contained AGC extends dynamic range without external components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","MESFETs","Feedback","Resistors","Silicon","Performance gain","Dynamic range","Active noise reduction","Parasitic capacitance","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","Schottky gate field effect transistors","wideband amplifiers","automatic gain control","field effect integrated circuits","linear integrated circuits","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MESFET transimpedance amplifier","wide dynamic range","loopback testing","telecommunication system testing","noise performance","high sensitivity amplifier","semi-insulating substrate","voltage gain","short-channel MESFETs","self-contained AGC","500 MHz","GaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344651","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344651.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2pAspl radic/Hz 622 Mb/s GaAs MESFET transimpedance amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 2pAspl radic/Hz 622 Mb/s GaAs MESFET transimpedance amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344651/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817612","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2pAspl radic/Hz 622 Mb/s GaAs MESFET transimpedance amplifier","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048922S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"5","articleId":"344651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":344654,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

The resulting fill-factor of each 107/spl times/107 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ photosensor is approximately 12%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344657/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4817606","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A wide-dynamic-range, low-power photosensor array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wide-dynamic-range, low-power photosensor array","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039139S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"61","articleId":"344657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":344658,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The increased sensor array size inevitably raises the data rate and leads to difficulties in image processing. Most of these difficulties come from the scanning operation in which spatially adjacent vertical pixels are arranged separately in a time axis. To solve the problem, this amplified MOS imager (AMI) outputs three neighboring lines simultaneously. This permits signals from spatially-adjacent vertical pixels to be handled at the same time. Two advantages made it possible to realize this sensor. One is signal charge amplification to prevent SNR degradation, the other is a non-destructive read-out function. The sensor is fabricated with 0.8 /spl mu/m, double-polysilicon double-aluminum CMOS process technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image processing","Image sensors","Pixel","Sensor arrays","Blanking","Circuits","Delay","Cameras","Laboratories","Ambient intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensors","photodiodes","image processing equipment","CMOS integrated circuits","amplification","nondestructive readout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplified MOS imager","image processing","solid-state imaging sensor technology","scanning operation","signal charge amplification","SNR degradation","nondestructive read-out function","double-polysilicon double-Al process","submicron CMOS process technology","NDRO","0.8 micron","Si-Al"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344658","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344658.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An amplified MOS imager suited for image processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An amplified MOS imager suited for image processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344658/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817605","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An amplified MOS imager suited for image processing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027485S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"8","articleId":"344658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":344659,"authors":[{"name":"B.

However, they suffer from low yields, consume too much power, and are plagued with SNR limitations due to the shifting and detection of analog charge packets, and the fact that data is communicated off chip in analog form. This paper describes an area image sensor that can potentially circumvent the limitations of CCDs and their alternatives. It uses a standard CMOS process and can therefore be manufactured with high yield. Digital circuitry for control and signal processing can be integrated with the sensor. Moreover, CMOS technology advances such as scaling and extra layers of metal can be used to improve pixel density and sensor performance. The analog image data is immediately converted to digital at each pixel using a one-bit sigma-delta modulator. The use of sigma-delta modulation allows the data-conversion circuitry to be simple and insensitive to process variations. A global shutter provides variable light input attenuation to achieve wide dynamic range. Data is communicated off chip in a digital form, eliminating the SNR degradation of analog data communication. To demonstrate the viability of the approach, an area image sensor chip is fabricated in a 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. The device consists of an array of 64x64 pixel blocks, a clock driver, a 6:64 row address decoder, 64 latched sense amplifiers, and 16 4:1 column multiplexers. The chip also contains data compression circuitry.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344659","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344659.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS area image sensor with pixel-level A/D conversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS area image sensor with pixel-level A/D conversion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817604","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS area image sensor with pixel-level A/D conversion","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049437S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"57","articleId":"344659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":344661,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Image sensor performance includes a 40 k-electron charge-handling capability in the V-CCD, leading to a 71 dB dynamic range, and sufficient transfer efficiency in the H-CCD, with no deterioration in V-CCD to H-CCD transfer efficiency. The power consumption is 0.49 W, just 22% of that previously achieved in a 1-inch 2 M pixel frame interline transfer (FIT) CCD.

CMOS LSI power consumption decreases in proportion to the square of the supply voltage (Vdd). Therefore, the most effective way to minimize power consumption is to reduce Vdd to 1V, the minimum voltage needed for direct one-cell-battery operation. Reported 1V digital circuits operating above 10 Mb/s use a multi-threshold (MT) CMOS circuit that has normal and low-threshold-voltage transistors. However, implementing a 1V analog interface is difficult because of degradation in analog circuit performance. A swing-suppression noise-shaping technique and circuit suitable for operation at 1V or less solves this problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344674","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344674.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1V power supply, 384 ks/s 10b A/D and D/A converters with swing-suppression noise shaping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344674/","displayDocTitle":"1V power supply, 384 ks/s 10b A/D and D/A converters with swing-suppression noise shaping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817589","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1V power supply, 384 ks/s 10b A/D and D/A converters with swing-suppression noise shaping","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023141S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"8","articleId":"344674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":344676,"authors":[{"name":"I.

For 16b performance with low oversampling ratio it is necessary to use high-order noise shaping and/or multi-level quantizers and DACs, both leading to problems in design or manufacture if realized directly.

Discrete InP HEMT devices have shown transconductances (g/sub m/) as high as 1740 mS/mm and cutoff frequencies (f/sub T/) up to 340 GHz and thus are extremely attractive devices for high gain amplifiers in the 30-100 GHz range. For very broadband instrumentation applications, this process is used to realize a fully-integrated, three-stage, shunt-feedback amplifier with 17 dB gain from 100 MHz to 70 GHz, a gain-bandwidth product the authors believe to be the highest reported for any amplifier. In comparison to distributed amplifiers typically used for such broadband applications, this amplifier has higher gain, better low-frequency response, uses less dc power, and yet has good output power capability. Potentially low-cost MMICs of this type could open the millimeter-wave frequencies to commercial applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344679","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344679.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"179","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 17 dB gain, 0.1-70 GHz InP HEMT amplifier IC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","displayDocTitle":"A 17 dB gain, 0.1-70 GHz InP HEMT amplifier IC","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817583","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344679/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 17 dB gain, 0.1-70 GHz InP HEMT amplifier IC","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036957S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"8","articleId":"344679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":344680,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Design rules for other dimensions correspond to a 1 /spl mu/m technology, yielding a minimum source/drain area of 2.2 /spl times/2.2 /spl mu/m/sup 2/. Thus the contribution of the source/drain junction capacitance is substantial, severely limiting speed.

There are two serious problems in widening the bandwidth of the amplifier IC. One is the chip mounting, where the wavelength of the electrical signal approaches the physical size of the mounting elements such as the package cavity, input/output leads, bonding wires and so on. Therefore, the three-dimensional distributed effects of these elements must be controlled in the circuit design for stable amplifier operations. The other is the circuit configuration of the amplifier. Amplifiers designed using the lumped-constant theory have a bandwidth restriction caused from parasitic capacitance. On the other hand, a distributed amplifier is capable of eliminating this restriction. A suitable package is based on the concept of \"a chip-size cavity package\", by which the parasitic resonance is suppressed and the isolation characteristics between input and output ports are greatly improved. Second, a frequency-dependent biasing termination is employed for the drain-line of the amplifier to improve gain degradation at frequencies below 1OGHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817584","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"60 GHz-bandwidth distributed baseband amplifier IC in a package optimized for isolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"60 GHz-bandwidth distributed baseband amplifier IC in a package optimized for isolation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037537S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"9","articleId":"344690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":344693,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Use of flash memory to store both data and code requires fast write with interruptible erase. Portable systems operate at 3.3 V to optimize battery life, while the desktop remains primarily a 5 V platform. This 16 Mb flash memory on a 0.6 /spl mu/m CMOS process operates with either 3.3 or 5 V supply. In the 3.3 V mode, a word line boost circuit is enabled, the input buffer trip points are modified, and the read path circuits are reconfigured for optimum performance. This memory uses the host computer 12 V supply to minimize flash media cost and maximize flash media performance. The device contains an advanced user interface that allows the host to queue up to three commands for execution by the write state machine, designed to allow erase to be interrupted so a program operation can be executed. Two 256B page buffers improve write performance and reduce host overhead. Wafer yields are improved by including redundant row pairs and columns.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344694","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344694.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3.3 V 16 Mb flash memory with advanced write automation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 3.3 V 16 Mb flash memory with advanced write automation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4817569","publicationDate":"1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344694/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3.3 V 16 Mb flash memory with advanced write automation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344694.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051881S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"10","articleId":"344694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":344695,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These solutions frequently involve complicated processing steps and/or the ultimate limitations of current Si-MOS devices. DRAM on silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate is a more simple solution to the problem. Thin-film SOI structures with isolation by implanted oxygen (SIMOX) process are under investigation for SRAM and logic. A SOI-DRAM test device with 100 nm thick SOI film has been fabricated in 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS/SIMOX technology. With this 64 kb SOI-DRAM the bit-line to memory cell capacitance ratio Cb/Cs is reduced by 25% compared with the reference bulk-Si DRAM, because of the decreased junction capacitance. RAS access time tRAC is 70 ns at 2.7 VVcc, as fast as the equivalent bulk-Si device at 4 VVcc. The clock timing in this DRAM is not optimized, so access time should improve with well-tuned clocks. The boosted-level generator with body-contact structure enhances the upper Vcc margin and the reduced body-effect of sense-amplifier transistors improves the lower Vcc margin. The SOI-DRAM has an operating Vcc range from 2.3 V to 4.0 V.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon on insulator technology","Random access memory","CMOS technology","Capacitance","Clocks","Ultra large scale integration","Circuits","Low voltage","Substrates","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIMOX","DRAM chips","CMOS integrated circuits","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOI DRAM","wide operating voltage range","CMOS/SIMOX technology","memory cell structures","low voltage operation","SOI substrate","thin-film SOI structures","bit-line to memory cell capacitance ratio","junction capacitance","boosted-level generator","body-contact structure","dynamic RAM","100 nm","0.5 micron","64 kbit","70 ns","2.3 to 4 V","Si"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344698","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344698","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344698.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344698","startPage":"138","endPage":"139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SOI-DRAM with wide operating voltage range by CMOS/SIMOX technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An SOI-DRAM with wide operating voltage range by CMOS/SIMOX technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817565","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SOI-DRAM with wide operating voltage range by CMOS/SIMOX technology","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02912S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"8","articleId":"344698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":344709,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Guo","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Bin Guo","id":"37087895690"},{"name":"A.

The temperature behavior is a flat cubic function, and therefore positive and negative deviations with respect to the reference temperature are compensated. A field test on 20 watch samples containing an oscillator built around this quartz showed that over a 3-year period, the maximum deviation is less than 3 seconds/year. Note that these results are obtained without any temperature compensation scheme. As the power consumption of a 2.1 MHz quartz oscillator (2.3/spl mu/A) is not compatible with the power consumption of standard watch oscillator circuits (<300nA), the 2.1MHz quartz oscillator is periodically powered for a short time and locks a continuously-running 32MHz, 200nA quartz oscillator. While short term precision is provided by the 32MHz oscillator, longer-term deviations are corrected by the periodically activated 2.1MHz oscillator. The chosen periodicity is 10 minutes, corresponding to the thermal constants in a watch.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344713","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344713.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A microprocessor-based analog wristwatch chip with 3 seconds/year accuracy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344713/","displayDocTitle":"A microprocessor-based analog wristwatch chip with 3 seconds/year accuracy","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817550","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A microprocessor-based analog wristwatch chip with 3 seconds/year accuracy","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033556S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"14","articleId":"344713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":344714,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The compression algorithm in the MPEG2 is based on discrete cosine transform (DCT), variable length coding, and motion compensation similar to the MPEG1, the earlier standard.

At video bandwidths in CMOS technologies, however, op-amp settling time limits this ratio and increases the complexity of the anti-alias filter. Op amps and anti-aliasing are not needed with a continuous-time, transconductance-capacitor structure, but, this approach requires complex tuning. To avoid such tuning and to increase the sample-rate-to-corner-frequency ratio, this paper describes a prototype SCF that uses parallelism.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Operational amplifiers","Transfer functions","Band pass filters","Frequency","CMOS technology","Switches","Prototypes","Delay","Poles and zeros"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched capacitor filters","active filters","CMOS integrated circuits","linear integrated circuits","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched-capacitor filter","CMOS","parallelism","sample rate","corner frequency","video bandwidths","op-amp settling time","sample-rate-to-corner-frequency ratio","2 micron","80 MHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344725","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344725.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A switched-capacitor filter in 2 /spl mu/m CMOS using parallelism to sample at 80 MHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A switched-capacitor filter in 2 /spl mu/m CMOS using parallelism to sample at 80 MHz","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344725/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817537","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A switched-capacitor filter in 2 /spl mu/m CMOS using parallelism to sample at 80 MHz","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033859S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"6","articleId":"344725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":344732,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Reduction of the number of battery cells to 3 or 4 requires ICs with 3 V supply and low power consumption. The one-chip 2 GHz single superhet receiver for digital data transmission in a 7.5 GHz bipolar process is optimized for low power consumption and a dynamic range of at least 70 dB at the RF signal input. The IC is suitable for both radios and base stations of digital mobile radio, especially cordless phone systems up to 2 GHz including the Digital European Cordless Telephone (DECT), wireless LAN systems and any other systems using incoherent FSK modulation. Previously-published receiver circuits are not characterized for 2 GHz applications, can not handle 11O MHz IF or 1 Mb/s data rate, or do not have a comparable level of integration. The IC presented here consists of a 2 GHz RF mixer, a 40 to 115 MHz limiter with a radio signal strength indicator (RSSI), an incoherent FM demodulator, a sample-and-hold off-set compensation circuit and a baseband filter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344735","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344735.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A one-chip 2 GHz single superhet receiver for 2 Mb/s FSK radio communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A one-chip 2 GHz single superhet receiver for 2 Mb/s FSK radio communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817528","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A one-chip 2 GHz single superhet receiver for 2 Mb/s FSK radio communication","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052917S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"23","articleId":"344735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":344736,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In portable equipment, battery-powered operation is inevitable. Lowering the power-supply voltage is one effective way of simultaneously decreasing power dissipation, weight, and size of equipment. Digital cellular phones and digital cordless phones using the UHF to L bands employ Si-bipolar direct-conversion quadrature-modulator chips that operate at 5 V. One factor preventing supply-voltage reduction is use of double-balanced mixers (DBMs). They need the highest supply voltage of all RF circuit components because they are based on the Gilbert cell. Lowering the supply voltage of a Gilbert cell mixer degrades its linearity and modulation accuracy. This paper describes a 2 GHz Si-bipolar direct-conversion quadrature modulator with a tunable on-chip 90/spl deg/ phase shifter. The above problems are solved by a current-folded double-balanced mixer (CF-DBM) suitable for low-voltage operation. The modulator operates with 2 V supply and consumes 68 mW. Phase-shifter cut-off frequency control allows 0.8 to 2.0 GHz modulator bandwidth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344736.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"41","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2 V 2 GHz Si-bipolar direct-conversion quadrature modulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Cellular phones","Phase modulation","Wireless LAN","Power dissipation","Radio frequency","Degradation","Linearity","Tunable circuits and devices","Phase shifters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon","elemental semiconductors","bipolar integrated circuits","mixers (circuits)","phase shifters","MMIC","modulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct-conversion quadrature modulator","bipolar IC","portable equipment","battery-powered operation","UHF","supply-voltage reduction","double-balanced mixers","Gilbert cell","tunable onchip phase shifter","current-folded mixer","low-voltage operation","cutoff frequency control","L-band","2 V","2 GHz","68 mW","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","displayDocTitle":"A 2 V 2 GHz Si-bipolar direct-conversion quadrature modulator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817527","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2 V 2 GHz Si-bipolar direct-conversion quadrature modulator","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05946S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"22","articleId":"344736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":344738,"authors":[{"name":"L.

They consist of dual baseband A/D converters with performance limited to approximately 60 to 75 dB dynamic range. Thus, these architectures require the following components in the preceding IF strip. Since the overall system dynamic range is on the order of 140 dB, a large amount of programmable gain (80-100 dB) is required in the preceding RF/IF strip to preserve the system noise. External filters at both the first and second IF frequencies are required to provide full channel selectivity before the A/D conversion is performed. Also, dual analog quadrature mixers are required to convert the receive signal from the second IF to baseband. The mixed-signal CMOS device presented in this paper substantially reduces the programmable gain, filtering, and external components required in the IF strip. This is accomplished by performing an IF A/D conversion and providing 98 dB dynamic range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344738.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cellular analog front end with a 98 dB IF receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic range","Strips","Baseband","Telephony","Gain","Radio frequency","Filters","Frequency conversion","Mixers","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","radiotelephony","cellular radio","analogue-digital conversion","transceivers","radio receivers","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular analog front end","IF receiver","mixed-signal CMOS devices","cellular telephony","IF A/D conversion","programmable gain","filtering","IF ADC","80 to 100 dB","1.8 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","displayDocTitle":"A cellular analog front end with a 98 dB IF receiver","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817525","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cellular analog front end with a 98 dB IF receiver","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039806S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"17","articleId":"344738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":344740,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The SSRX chip receiver presented in this paper is designed for low SNR loss by using a coherent architecture, allowing applications ranging from voice to data transmission. The three components in the coherent architecture are the Costas loop, the PN-acquisition loop, and the clock recovery loop. To maintain system stability, the loop bandwidths are chosen through simulation and each loop is isolated from the others during acquisition through a control sequence provided by a finite-state machine.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344741","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344741.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","startPage":"30","endPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 12.7 Mchip/s all-digital BPSK direct sequence spread-spectrum IF transceiver in 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 12.7 Mchip/s all-digital BPSK direct sequence spread-spectrum IF transceiver in 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344741/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817522","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 12.7 Mchip/s all-digital BPSK direct sequence spread-spectrum IF transceiver in 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04304S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"5","articleId":"344741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":344744,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

Technology improvements and design cleverness have been devoted mostly to reaching higher speed and higher precision. In recent years, there has been a sudden change driven mainly by an urgent need for portability, but also by concerns about the growing relative cost of power supplies and of heat removal systems, and even about limits of power available from the local network. It has now become necessary to build new products with at least the same performance in speed and dynamic range, but with stringent requirements on low power. This raises questions about the limits and how they can be approached.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1111/8026/00344744.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power design: ways to approach the limits","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1994.344744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=344744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Low-power design: ways to approach the limits","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817519","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power design: ways to approach the limits","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00344744.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038129S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 1994","isNumber":"8026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1111","citationCount":"122","articleId":"344744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":344783,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this paper we propose a new neural network training algorithm, ternary synaptic weights (TSW) algorithm, which offers fast, guaranteed learning and automatic topology determination. Also, it provides an insight into the interrelationships between the attributes and the classifications, which is very suitable for hybridization of neural networks and expert systems. Furthermore, it takes don't care attributes, which are an essential part of rule-based systems, into consideration during training.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SIPNN.1994.344783","pdfPath":"/iel2/1116/8027/00344783.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"506 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICSIPNN '94.

To obtain a good image of a time-varying object without motion artifact one requires a large number of consistent projections equally spaced in angle. A set of projections are consistent if all the projections relate to the same X-ray absorptivity distribution. This requires that all projections are measured during the same phase of the time-varying object. The authors introduce a new image reconstruction method based on a priori knowledge of the projections to achieve this objective. This method is implemented on a novel neural network and a new training algorithm is proposed. Computer simulation shows that this training algorithm is valid and minimizes the reconstruction mean square error.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SIPNN.1994.344789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPNN.1994.344789","startPage":"409","endPage":"412 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICSIPNN '94.

The continuous speech recognizer was developed for telecommunication-based applications which typically demand high sentence accuracy. Possible approaches for achieving high sentence accuracy include applying complicated speech modeling techniques or employing more knowledge sources when conducting the recognition search. An alternative solution is to first apply an N-best decoding search to obtain N sentence hypotheses using pre-selected knowledge source(s) and then re-score those hypotheses using other knowledge source(s) or models. The proposed N-best keyword search algorithm derives all keyword sentence hypotheses and the corresponding likelihood scores time-synchronously. We show that the algorithm guarantees to find all sentence hypotheses. To reduce the exponentially growing number of hypotheses, in practical implementation we applied empirically derived thresholds to prune the search. Recognition experiments were conducted on two speech corpora: TI Connected Digit Corpus and Road Rally Corpus, to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SIPNN.1994.344809","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICSIPNN '94.

In the previous works, this filter required many iterations in the bit-serial implementation of the positive Boolean function (PBF) and used a large number of counters, comparators and many AND-OR logic array inputs in a parallel architecture to output an M-th order sample. This limited the real-time applications for large window size. Based on the ordering property of the values of the elements in the m-array, we proposed a pipeline architecture to fold the parallel data flow in order to reduce the hardware complexity without loss of performance. The proposed design can also realize the concurrent search method for the PBF to output an M-th order sample. Compared with previous works, the hardware complexity is reduced from O(2/sup r/) to O(2/sup r/2/) area-time complexity and the latency approaches that of a parallel implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SIPNN.1994.344832","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICSIPNN '94.

With its adaptive properties, an artificial neural network (ANN) system is proposed and applied to the analysis of EMG for MUAP's detection. Features of MUAPs are extracted and fed into the ANN system for on-line training in which the number of classes is not fixed. Then the ANN recognises the signal based on the properties of the training samples. The performance of the system has been tested with different configurations of the ANN and different parameters of computer-simulated EMG signals. The system gives a recognition rate of about 80% for one MUAP with a firing rate of 5 Hz. The recognition rate decreases to 70% or less if the firing rate or the number of different MUAPs increases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344856/","accessionNumber":"4824532","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Signal analysis of electromyogram by artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal analysis of electromyogram by artificial neural network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00344856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059284S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1116","articleId":"344856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":344870,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

The paper describes the application of a hybrid ANN/rule-based optimised computing architecture to diphone speech synthesis. The architecture utilises a simplified rule-base, based on a diphone data base, and an ANN working in parallel. The number of hidden layer neurons in the ANN unit when used in parallel with the rule-base is reduced when compared to the hidden layer size of a standalone ANN used for diphone synthesis. This reduction in hidden layer size results in faster learning, with no reduction in overall system performance being observed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SIPNN.1994.344901","pdfPath":"/iel2/1116/8027/00344901.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"326 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICSIPNN '94.

This method is different from conventional bigram model, all the words in the vocabulary are mapped into several equivalence classes, according to the collocation between adjacent words. This modified bigram approach retains the simplicity and effectiveness of the bigram model, and also has the advantage of reducing the requirement of memory size to make this approach realizable on a PC computer. It also can moderate the problem of zero probabilities. All the parameters of the model are estimated from a corpus of 1.6 million words, covering a lexicon of 30,000 words. The training of the modified model is automatically realized with an unsupervised learning procedure. Several tests for decoding Chinese syllable strings to text have been carried out. The test results show that the average words correct rate is 87%. For news reports, a high word correct rate 96% is reached based on this modified bigram model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/344944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Apr 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4817924","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Language processing for Chinese speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Language processing for Chinese speech recognition","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00344944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027932S","chronDate":"13-16 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1116","citationCount":"1","articleId":"344944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":344952,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.

To despread the pseudo noise (PN) code and thus understanding the message sent, synchronization (acquisition fluid tracking) is necessary in priori. As a matter of fact, the throughput of a packet mode CDMA system is directly related to the performance of its frame synchronization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new acquisition technique for packet mode CDMA operating in the Rayleigh fading channel. The technique is based on on-off keying (during the preamble section) followed by a Markov chain search. The length of the preamble is a design parameter and the performance measure is the throughput of packets. We have tested our new scheme on a flat fading and a selective fading channel, based on a fixed blocking probability criterion. Specifically for the latter case, we adopt a RAKE receiver to combat the multipath effect, and introduce a windowing technique which we found effective in overcoming the temporary increase in noise level caused by partial correlation of the PN sequence used. Results in both cases show that the proposed on-off keying technique is more efficient than many others in the literature such as the coincidence detector or simple Markov search.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345059.pdf","startPage":"582","endPage":"586 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-off keying assisted acquisition scheme for burst mode DS/SS packet radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packet radio networks","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Throughput","Rayleigh channels","Detectors","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency","Testing","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet radio networks","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","digital radio","cellular radio","personal communication networks","synchronisation","Rayleigh channels","fading","Markov processes","land mobile radio","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-off keying assisted acquisition","burst mode DS/SS packet radio","personal communications","digital cellular communications","pseudonoise code","packet mode CDMA system","frame synchronization algorithm","Rayleigh fading channel","Markov chain search","design parameter","performance measure","packet throughput","flat fading channel","selective fading channel","blocking probability","RAKE receiver","multipath effect","windowing technique","noise level","partial correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"On-off keying assisted acquisition scheme for burst mode DS/SS packet radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4839927","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-off keying assisted acquisition scheme for burst mode DS/SS packet radio","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11152S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"5","articleId":"345059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":345060,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

These methods are optimal for the despreading of the PN code in the presence of Gaussian noise. In the multipath propagation environment, this processing gain is insufficient to reject effectively cochannel and multipath delay interference. This restricts the performance of the acquisition system and hence, of the receiver. Cancellation techniques can be used before acquisition, but this does not provide significant improvement in the case of the multipath delay and fading environment. A new channel filter to be used before the acquisition system is proposed to overcome the multi-user and multi-path delay interference. A simulator is used to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of multiple users and multi-path delay both with and without proposed channel filter. Details of the system configuration, the design concept of the proposed new channel filter and the simulation technique are discussed. The results show that the proposed new technique can significantly improve the overall system performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345061","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","startPage":"573","endPage":"577 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new channel filter for CDMA systems in multipath delay and fading environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new channel filter for CDMA systems in multipath delay and fading environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345061/","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4839925","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new channel filter for CDMA systems in multipath delay and fading environments","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044178S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"1","articleId":"345061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":345062,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

The \"classical\" near-far resistant receivers are multi-user detectors with rather high complexity requirements. In order to reduce the complexity, a class of minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers was proposed. These receivers typically use an adaptive filter to suppress the multi-user interference. The length of the filter is equal to the number of chips per bit. To further reduce the complexity, several methods that shorten the length of the adaptive filter have been developed. We present a common mathematical framework in which these receivers can be evaluated in terms of their probability of bit error. The form of the optimum complexity reduction is derived. Two new structures are proposed and are shown to outperform previously proposed receivers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345062.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"572 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum complexity reduction of minimum mean square error DS-CDMA receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mean square error methods","Multiaccess communication","Pulse modulation","Adaptive filters","Multiple access interference","AWGN channels","Pulse shaping methods","Detectors","Matched filters","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","radio receivers","adaptive filters","filtering theory","interference suppression","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","error statistics","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum mean square error","DS-CDMA receivers","optimum complexity reduction","direct-sequence code division multiple access","near-far problem","near-far resistant receivers","multi-user detectors","MMSE receivers","multi-user interference suppression","filter length","adaptive filter","bit error probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimum complexity reduction of minimum mean square error DS-CDMA receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4839924","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum complexity reduction of minimum mean square error DS-CDMA receivers","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043395S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"6","articleId":"345062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":345063,"authors":[{"name":"V.

No knowledge of the interfering signals is required. The demodulator uses a cyclic Wiener filter (FRESH filter) to decrease the bit error rate, and increase spectral efficiency. In some situations, the bit error rate is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude and capacity is tripled. For despreading and demodulating the signal-of-interest, the demodulator takes on a structure similar to that of fractionally-spaced equalizers. Substantial improvement over the conventional correlation receiver is obtained by exploiting spectral correlation of the signal-of-interest and the multiple access interference even with severe multipath distortion. The computational complexity of the receiver is equivalent to that of conventional equalizers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345063.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"567 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interference robust CDMA demodulator that uses spectral correlation properties","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Multiaccess communication","Demodulation","Equalizers","Wiener filter","Bit error rate","Multiple access interference","Statistics","AWGN","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","demodulators","radio receivers","Wiener filters","filtering theory","correlation methods","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA demodulator","spectral correlation properties","CDMA interference rejection","interfering signals","cyclic Wiener filter","bit error rate","spectral efficiency","despreading","demodulating","signal-of-interest","fractionally-spaced equalizers","multiple access interference","multipath distortion","computational complexity","receiver","FRESH filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"An interference robust CDMA demodulator that uses spectral correlation properties","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4839923","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interference robust CDMA demodulator that uses spectral correlation properties","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029408S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"5","articleId":"345063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":345065,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Two constructions of code sequences are considered, one for the OR channel and one for the Gaussian channel. A new construction of codes for the OR channel, which belongs to the family of cyclically permutable (CP) codes also known as optical orthogonal codes, removes the constraint of frame synchronization. This new construction of CP codes can be derived from known codes for the synchronous situation. The construction of codes for the Gaussian channel is for the synchronous case and has an exponential increase in the number of sequences when the length increases. For both constructions, we discuss the ability to handle noise and near-far effects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345066.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"553 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coding-theoretical view on code division multiple access: two new constructions of CDMA codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Gaussian channels","Protocols","Fading","Performance analysis","Feedback","Mobile communication","Delay effects","Codes","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","sequences","cyclic codes","Gaussian channels","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","CDMA codes","coding","code sequences","OR channel","Gaussian channel","cyclically permutable codes","optical orthogonal codes","noise effects","near-far effects","sequence length"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"A coding-theoretical view on code division multiple access: two new constructions of CDMA codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4839920","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coding-theoretical view on code division multiple access: two new constructions of CDMA codes","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056949S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","articleId":"345066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":345067,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We can estimate the velocity of a mobile terminal in a Rayleigh fading channel, because it is proportional to the Doppler frequency. Diversity reception is the most common method of improving communication quality in faded channels, and since the switching rate of diversity branches is proportional to the Doppler frequency, the velocity is easily estimated. We derived a relationship between the switching rate of the branches N/sub BS/ (times/s), and the Doppler frequency f/sub D/ (Hz): as follows N/sub BS//spl sime/1.3 f/sub D/. We confirmed this relationship experimentally, and since our method is very simple and needs no additional equipment, it can easily be implemented in mobile terminals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345101","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345101.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","startPage":"371","endPage":"374 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating velocity using diversity reception","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimating velocity using diversity reception","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345101/","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4839882","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating velocity using diversity reception","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059069S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"50","articleId":"345101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":345102,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This characterization is useful, both for the analysis of system performance, and to gain insights into the propagation phenomena involved. Software based on image theory and ray tracing is used to analyze two simple cases of street intersection. The results include predictions of the radio channel impulse response and comparisons with measurements undertaken in a city (Fribourg, Switzerland). It is shown that specular reflections can explain some measured results. However, reflection and diffraction cannot explain adequately all situations, especially if only building walls are considered. Thus, scattering effects need to be further investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray tracing based prediction of impulse responses in urban microcells","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345136","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345136.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"214 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Ray tracing based prediction of impulse responses in urban microcells","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4839848","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray tracing based prediction of impulse responses in urban microcells","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05224S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"5","articleId":"345136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":345137,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The aim is to determine which method is best for computing the complementary distribution function (CDF) of a sum of correlated lognormal RVs considering both accuracy and computational effort. Then, using these techniques, we compute the outage probability of a desired lognormal shadowed signal in the presence of multiple correlated lognormal cochannel interferers. The outage results are presented as a function of the reuse factor. Simulation results are used for verification and comparison. Overall, the results obtained in this paper show that among the three methods considered in this paper Wilkinson's approach may be the best method to compute tire CDF of sums of correlated lognormal RVs (and hence the outage probability in correlated lognormal shadowed mobile radio environments). This is due to both its accuracy and computational simplicity over the range of parameters valid for practical applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","startPage":"175","endPage":"179 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345143.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of methods of computing correlated lognormal sum distributions and outages for digital wireless applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of methods of computing correlated lognormal sum distributions and outages for digital wireless applications","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4839841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of methods of computing correlated lognormal sum distributions and outages for digital wireless applications","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054672S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"34","articleId":"345143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":345158,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Wan Sung","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chi Wan Sung","id":"37265579100"},{"name":"Wing Shing Wong","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wing Shing Wong","id":"37276110200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1927-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1090-3038"}],"articleNumber":"345158","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":144},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User speed estimation and dynamic channel allocation in hierarchical cellular system","abstract":"The huge amount of handoffs generated by microcells creates a problem for the future PCN. To alleviate the problem, we propose a hierarchical cellular system which comprises cells of different sizes. Ideally, one would like to use large cells to serve high-mobility users. A challenging issue is to obtain a good estimate of the user speed. A simple speed estimation is proposed and based on this estimate one can implement a number of dynamic channel allocation algorithms on such a hierarchical network. A comparative study of these algorithms will be presented based on a detailed simulation model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345158.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"95 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345158","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345158","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345158","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel allocation","Hierarchical systems","Personal communication networks","Traffic control","Macrocell networks","Switches","Microcell networks","Geometry","Bandwidth","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","personal communication networks","land mobile radio","radio spectrum management","frequency allocation","telecommunication channels","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical network","hierarchical cellular system","user speed estimation","microcells","PCN","dynamic channel allocation algorithms","simulation model","maximum likelihood estimator","mean square error estimator","MMSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345158/","displayDocTitle":"User speed estimation and dynamic channel allocation in hierarchical cellular system","accessionNumber":"4839825","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User speed estimation and dynamic channel allocation in hierarchical cellular system","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047676S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"41","articleId":"345158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":345164,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The results for the reverse link (mobile-to-base) are reported in this paper. Using typical system parameters in the simulations the following major results were obtained: (i) capacity is very sensitive to interference from neighboring cells, (ii) any increase in path loss between mobile and base has noticeable effects in interference reductions and capacity improvements, (iii) transmitted power dynamic ranges as high as 60 dB are needed for successful implementation of power control, (iv) performance of power control based on C/I is better than performance based on received power, (v) imperfect power control has drastic effects in capacity reductions, (vi) for ideal power control and with typical system parameters capacity of cellular CDMA is about 15 times capacity of analog systems. Imperfect power control or decrease in transmission path loss may, however, reduce this number by a factor of 2 to 3.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and capacity evaluations of CDMA mobile radio systems - reverse link analysis","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345164","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345164.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"69 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Performance and capacity evaluations of CDMA mobile radio systems - reverse link analysis","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4839819","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and capacity evaluations of CDMA mobile radio systems - reverse link analysis","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076325S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"9","articleId":"345164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":345167,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Also, the author has calculated that the B-CDMA mobile transmits on average with 16 dB less power than the GSM mobile, while the CDMA base transmit power per channel would be about 5.5 dB less than the GSM base due to the lower CIR required by the B-CDMA overlay system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345170","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345170.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","startPage":"31","endPage":"35 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity of broadband CDMA overlaying a GSM cellular system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The capacity of broadband CDMA overlaying a GSM cellular system","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345170/","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4839813","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity of broadband CDMA overlaying a GSM cellular system","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037179S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"13","articleId":"345170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":345172,"authors":[{"name":"P.G.

This paper presents simulation results on CDMA PCS system performance. In this simulation, we consider interference in the reverse link introduced by users within the center cell as well as users in the first two rings of neighboring cells.

Channel estimation is performed in the down link (base to mobile) by transmission of a pilot signal from the base station. Two different techniques for channel estimation are proposed and investigated in time and frequency selective channels. The first technique is based on correlation between the received signal and the pilot signal to perform channel identification, while the second is based on an adaptive stochastic gradient algorithm for channel equalization. The parameters that characterise the two techniques have been optimized in terms of BER and performance results are given in faded multipath environments with optimal parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4852150","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation for a DS-CDMA mobile radio system with a coherent reception","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation for a DS-CDMA mobile radio system with a coherent reception","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084155S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"2","articleId":"345184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":345185,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In San Diego. The paper presents measurement and modeling results on CDMA PCS in-building systems. A distributed antenna system with three nodes, each having two time delayed elements, was set up in a Qualcomm two story office building in San Diego. Wideband CDMA signal coverage was predicted by using a ray tracing tool. The prediction shows good signal coverage in both floors of the building using the three nodes mounted in the ceiling space between the first and second floors with each active element transmitting at -5 dBm. The prediction results are confirmed by measurements at numerous discrete points with a standard deviation of 3.3 dB. Measurements using various combinations of number of nodes and delay elements show significant time and path diversity advantages due to the three finger RAKE receiver in indoor radio environments. Trade-offs between diversity gain and self-interference due to uncaptured finger energy in fringe areas are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurements and modeling of CDMA PCS in-building systems with distributed antenna","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345186","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345186.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"737 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Measurements and modeling of CDMA PCS in-building systems with distributed antenna","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852152","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements and modeling of CDMA PCS in-building systems with distributed antenna","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027796S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"1","articleId":"345186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":345187,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Multipath power delay profiles for typical urban, hilly terrain and rural areas which are derived from those specified for the GSM system have been used to assess the robustness of the CDMA system against frequency-selective fading. The effect of interference on the system performance is also investigated for the three multipath environments. Furthermore, the authors evaluate the performance of a single path-lock correlation receiver and compare the results obtained with that of the Rake multipath combining receiver for a spreading bandwidth of 1.27 MHz. The effect of spreading bandwidth allocation on the diversity performance of the Rake system in the urban channel has also been investigated.

The conventional suboptimum receiver consisting of a bank of matched filters is often inefficient because interference is treated as noise. The optimum multi-user detector is too complex to be implemented at present. Four suboptimum detection techniques based on zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization with and without decision feedback (DF) are presented and compared. They combat both ISI and MAI. The computational complexity of all four equalizers is essentially the same and they are independent of the size of the data symbol alphabet. It is shown that all four equalizers considerably outperform the conventional receiver. The MMSE equalizers are superior to the corresponding ZF equalizers. Furthermore, the equalizers with DF perform better than the corresponding equalizers without DF. An algorithm termed channel sorting is introduced to reduce the impairing effect of error propagation on the equalizers with DF.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345192.pdf","startPage":"762","endPage":"766 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equalizers for multi-user detection in code division multiple access mobile radio systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Multiuser detection","Intersymbol interference","Multiple access interference","Multiaccess communication","Time varying systems","Multipath channels","Matched filters","Detectors","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","code division multiple access","multipath channels","intersymbol interference","decision feedback equalisers","time-varying channels","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-user detection","code division multiple access","mobile radio systems","CDMA","time-varying multipath channels","intersymbol interference","ISI","multiple access interference","suboptimum detection techniques","minimum mean square error equalization","decision feedback","computational complexity","data symbol alphabet size","MMSE equalizers","channel sorting algorithm","error propagation","zero forcing equalizers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Equalizers for multi-user detection in code division multiple access mobile radio systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852158","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalizers for multi-user detection in code division multiple access mobile radio systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042816S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"16","articleId":"345192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":345193,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Tang","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Zhenyu Tang","id":"37347653800"},{"name":"Shixin Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Shixin Cheng","id":"37276496700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1927-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1090-3038"}],"articleNumber":"345193","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Multiple access interference","Decorrelation","AWGN","Interference cancellation","Performance analysis","Base stations","Correlators","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","signal detection","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pre-decorrelating single user detection","CDMA systems","forward direction","centralized DS/CDMA systems","inverse crosscorrelation matrix","signature waveforms","multiple access interference cancellation","decorrelating multiuser detector","simulation results","performance analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a new scheme for single user detection in the forward direction of centralized DS/CDMA systems.

Good orthogonality between spreading codes with near perfect average power control is essential for adequate spectrum efficiency in conventional CDMA applications but good average power control is often difficult to maintain. interference cancellation code division multiple access (IC-CDMA) is a method proposed for third generation mobile systems which considerably improves the user capacity of a spread spectrum system. A significant advantage of IC-CDMA is that it does not require equal received powers thereby eliminating the need for complex power control algorithms. The system design was evaluated using a simulation toolset which supports direct DSP implementations. The toolset, based on a hierarchical block diagram approach, was used to evaluate the performance of IC-CDMA for various system configurations and channel conditions. The results obtained illustrate that IC-CDMA, with some restrictions, is more suitable for a cellular application than conventional CDMA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345195","startPage":"775","endPage":"779 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345195.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spread spectrum wireless LAN based on interference cancellation techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"A spread spectrum wireless LAN based on interference cancellation techniques","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4852161","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345195/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spread spectrum wireless LAN based on interference cancellation techniques","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037237S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","articleId":"345195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345196,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed canceller consists of a fractionally chip-spaced code-orthogonalizing filter (COF) and a differential detector. The COF adaptively makes its tap coefficients orthogonal to all other users' spreading codes by minimizing the mean squared error between the detected and decision signal. After the MAI cancellation, the differential detector removes fast phase variation in the desired carrier due to fading. The proposed adaptive interference canceller (AIC) only uses the desired spreading code and needs no information about other users. Thus, the AIC is practical for its simplicity and promising for future DS/CDMA mobile radio systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345196.pdf","startPage":"780","endPage":"784 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS/CDMA adaptive interference canceller on differential detection in fast fading channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference cancellation","Multiple access interference","Land mobile radio","Fading","Detectors","Mobile communication","Filters","Adaptive signal detection","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","demodulation","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","fading","telecommunication channels","code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive interference canceller","differential detection","fast fading channel","DS/CDMA","multiple-access interference canceller","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access","mobile radio communications","fractionally chip-spaced code-orthogonalizing filter","differential detector","tap coefficients","spreading codes","mean squared error","decision signal","detected signal","fading","carrier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"DS/CDMA adaptive interference canceller on differential detection in fast fading channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852162","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS/CDMA adaptive interference canceller on differential detection in fast fading channel","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03302S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"17","articleId":"345196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":345197,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Power control with no constraint on the maximum power level has been studied extensively in earlier work. Transmitter power is at a premium in radio systems such as cellular systems and PCS. There is a limit on the maximum transmitter power especially at the terminals (e.g. mobile units and handsets) since the power comes from a battery. In this paper we study power control that maximizes the minimum carrier to interference ratio (CIR), with a constraint on the maximum power. The optimal power vector solution lies on the boundary of the constrained power vector set and achieves a balance in the CIR's. Results indicate that the constraints do not induce any stability problems. A distributed scheme with favourable convergence properties and close to optimum performance is presented. Simulation results show that the algorithm tries to maximize the number of terminals served with CIR greater than or equal to the target CIR, while conserving power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained power control in cellular radio systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345205","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345205.pdf","startPage":"824","endPage":"828 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Constrained power control in cellular radio systems","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852171","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained power control in cellular radio systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032409S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"107","articleId":"345205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345209,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Based on a ray tracing simulation, the radio propagation is modelled for an arbitrary environment in which simulations for voice and for mixed data/voice services are performed. The results can be used for both, an optimization of a given installation, i.e. placing of a minimum number of base stations inside a building taking the traffic and service requirements into account, and for performance evaluation of the DECT system, i.e. reduction of handover blocking probability through an improved handover algorithm, or traffic capacity under given quality and interference scenario.

The authors present closed-form expressions for the upper bound on the bit error rate with optimum combining, for any number of antennas and interferers, with coherent detection of BPSK and QAM signals, and differential detection of DPSK. They also present bounds on the performance gain of optimum combining over maximal ratio combining. These bounds are asymptotically tight with decreasing BER, and results show that the asymptotic gain is within 2 dB of the gain as determined by computer simulation for a variety of cases at a 10/sup -3/ BER. The closed-form expressions for the bound permit rapid calculation of the improvement with optimum combining for any number of interferers and antennas, as compared with the cpu hours previously required by Monte Carlo simulation. Thus, these bounds allow calculation of the performance of optimum combining under a variety of conditions where it was not possible previously, including analysis of the outage probability with shadow fading and the combined effect of adaptive arrays and dynamic channel assignment in mobile radio systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345230","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345230.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345230","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","startPage":"942","endPage":"946 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Upper bounds on the bit error rate of optimum combining in wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Upper bounds on the bit error rate of optimum combining in wireless systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345230/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852196","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Upper bounds on the bit error rate of optimum combining in wireless systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025983S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"14","articleId":"345230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345231,"authors":[{"name":"Yawgeng Chau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze Institute of Technology, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yawgeng Chau","id":"37658706900"},{"name":"Ji-Ten Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze Institute of Technology, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ji-Ten Sun","id":"37657545900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1927-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1090-3038"}],"articleNumber":"345231","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rician channels","Diversity reception","Multiaccess communication","Binary phase shift keying","Fading","Upper bound","Satellite communication","Personal communication networks","Demodulation","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","land mobile radio","Rician channels","fading","mobile satellite communication","phase shift keying","error statistics","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal distributed detection diversity","direct-sequence CDMA","shadowed Rician fading land-mobile satellite channel","distributed decisions","BPSK","DS-CDMA","Chernoff upper bounds","bit error probability","performance evaluation","maximal ratio combining","Gaussian distributed signal"]}],"abstract":"Two diversity schemes with distributed decisions are analyzed for BPSK direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) in a shadowed Rician fading land-mobile satellite channel.

The need for microcell and even picocell systems will be greatly increased in the near future. One of the most important factors will then be to provide high traffic capacity and to provide an easy way of performing frequency planning for the system operator. In this paper we present results from system simulations based on the GSM recommendation phase two. We show that the use of power regulation in both up- and downlink in combination with discontinuous transmission (DTX) and slow frequency hopping makes it possible to decrease the frequency reuse distance below 3/9 whilst maintaining system performance. Results from simulations with different frequency reuse distances are presented. System characteristics such as capacity, quality and robustness are evaluated and compared to a fixed plan reference system without frequency hopping or DTX.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FH-GSM frequency hopping GSM","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345273","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345273.pdf","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1159 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"FH-GSM frequency hopping GSM","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852239","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FH-GSM frequency hopping GSM","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051992S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"31","articleId":"345273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":345280,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

Three major factors that affect access channel performance are collision, blocking, and frame erasure rate (FER). All three factors can cause retransmission which results in lower throughput and longer delay. An iterative method is presented to estimate the effective arrival rate in a system without combining. The access rate sequence generated by the iteration is monotone increasing and converges if the system is stable. Using this result, a stability condition is determined in terms of the arrival rate of new messages and the FER. We modify the standard slotted ALOHA analysis so that it applies to a system with combining. The study reveals the trade-off between the messages received per slot and the FER.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345280","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345280.pdf","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1192 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS/SS CDMA slotted access channel performance analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345280/","displayDocTitle":"DS/SS CDMA slotted access channel performance analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852246","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS/SS CDMA slotted access channel performance analysis","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02467S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"2","articleId":"345280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":345289,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This makes transmit antenna selection diversity possible to combat performance loss in slow fading channels. The best transmit antenna is selected on the basis of signal measurements in preceding receive time slots. Previously proposed selection algorithms have poor performance, if the signal measurements are corrupted by noise. The structure of the optimum selection algorithm for noisy coherent signal measurements is reviewed. It involves an adaptive linear predictor. The design of an optimum nonadaptive predictor is described and the error performance of a system with DECT-like parameters is given.

The problem is to detect the data sequence and at the same time estimate the channel parameters such that the output from the decoder is as reliable as possible. Maximum likelihood (ML) detection fulfils this goal but, unfortunately, it leads to non-recursive and computationally complex algorithms. The approach taken in the present paper is to use the trellis corresponding to the combined states of the encoder and the channel. A modified Viterbi algorithm is then used. Simulation results show that when the channel is time-invariant and noisy, data can be detected with only 0.5 [dB] loss compared to ML-detection with the channel known to the receiver. The algorithm also performs well when the channel is time-varying. Compared to algorithms performing channel detection and decoding separately, the new algorithm is more complex but the performance loss is lower.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345294.pdf","endPage":"1258 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous data detection and channel estimation with the Viterbi algorithm","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345294","startPage":"1254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous data detection and channel estimation with the Viterbi algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345294/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4852260","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous data detection and channel estimation with the Viterbi algorithm","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039613S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"1","articleId":"345294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":345296,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The first device is a chip matched filter, which performs square root raised cosine transmit/receive filtering, while the second implements complex correlations and coherent BPSK/QPSK demodulation. The coefficients of the chip matched filter are represented as canonic signed digits (CSD) in order to reduce chip size and allow sampling rates up to 100 MHz. The second ASIC contains six independent complex correlators for channel sounding and despreading. Four RAKE arms are used for data detection by coherently combining the signals from the strongest propagation paths. Special attention has been given to the tradeoff between chip area and system performance (bit error probability) through careful choice of word lengths for each processing stage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345309","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345309.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","startPage":"1326","endPage":"1330 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASIC implementation of a direct-sequence spread-spectrum RAKE-receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ASIC implementation of a direct-sequence spread-spectrum RAKE-receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345309/","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858668","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASIC implementation of a direct-sequence spread-spectrum RAKE-receiver","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108157S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"11","articleId":"345309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":345310,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A practical approach to implementing a microcell system overlaid with an existing macrocell system is proposed. There is no need to design the channel assignment and transmit power management for the microcell system by introducing the channel segregation, a self-organized dynamic channel assignment and the automatic transmit power control. The system channels are reused automatically between the macrocells and microcells. The interference from the macrocell to the microcell is compensated by slight increase of transmit power for the microcell system.

We propose a method for null-beam forming at the transmitting frequency that uses these parameters, which makes it possible to carry out adaptive null-beam forming both in receiving and transmitting.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345345","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345345.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345345","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","startPage":"1498","endPage":"1502 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitting null beam forming with beam space adaptive array antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Transmitting null beam forming with beam space adaptive array antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345345/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4864484","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitting null beam forming with beam space adaptive array antennas","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026068S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"8","articleId":"345345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":345346,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For this purpose a propagation model which incorporates the angular distribution of the rays in the vicinity of the mobile is postulated. Also included in the model is the interference from co-channel cells. With the aid of the model, a weight selection algorithm is derived. The proposed system is simulated with different numbers of mobiles per channel in each cell and different numbers of antenna elements in the arrays. Also varied is the cluster size. This is done to determine the optimal trade-off between reduced cluster size and multiple mobiles per channel in each cell. The results show that it is possible to increase capacity between two and twelve times depending on the number of antennas in the arrays and the spread of the local scattering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345349.pdf","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345349","startPage":"1517","endPage":"1521 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The spectrum efficiency of a base station antenna array system for spatially selective transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345349/","displayDocTitle":"The spectrum efficiency of a base station antenna array system for spatially selective transmission","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4864488","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The spectrum efficiency of a base station antenna array system for spatially selective transmission","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038113S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"25","articleId":"345349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345352,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

A full short circuit planar inverted-F antenna (FS-PIFA) is investigated, which concentrates the current near the antenna, and has a relatively higher gain directed away from the user's head thereby reducing the losses in the human body, which is important from the point of view of efficiency and possible health hazards. For design and analysis of the antenna including parts of the human body the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is employed, and measurements of average received power and spatial peak specific absorption rate, SAR, values were performed, to verify simulation results. Measurements of the antenna gain in realistic environments with a person showed a gain about 2 dB less than a half wavelength whip on the same telephone, while the local SAR was typically 0.1-0.2 mW/cm/sup 3/, a factor of ten smaller than present standards and handportables.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated antennas for hand-held telephones with low absorption","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345353","endPage":"1541 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345353.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","startPage":"1537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345353","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telephony","Absorption","Humans","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Antenna measurements","Wavelength measurement","Circuits","Hazards","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["health hazards","finite difference time-domain analysis","cellular radio","mobile antennas","telephone sets","antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated antennas","hand-held telephones","low absorption","high efficiency","limited power","full short circuit planar inverted-F antenna","human body","losses","health hazards","design","finite difference time domain method","average received power","spatial peak specific absorption rate","simulation results","antenna gain","realistic environments","half wavelength whip","standards","handportables","FDTD"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated antennas for hand-held telephones with low absorption","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4864492","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated antennas for hand-held telephones with low absorption","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037109S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"31","articleId":"345353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345354,"authors":[{"name":"C.G.

Though OQPSK shows a better performance over nonlinear channels than /spl pi//4-QPSK, the latter is preferred, since it allows for differential demodulation, which is an attractive combined channel estimation and demodulation technique on fast fading channels. In the present paper, we describe a receiver for the differential demodulation of differentially modulated OQPSK signals. The bit error rate of the new receiver is compared with /spl pi//4-DQPSK on AWGN and Rayleigh fading linear channels, with transmitter and receiver raised cosine pulse shaping being assumed in all cases. On these linear channels and a roll off factor r=0.5, a loss of less than 0.5 dB of DOQPSK with respect to /spl pi//4-DQPSK is found. Therefore, the advantage of OQPSK over /spl pi//4-DQPSK on non-linear channels will essentially be maintained with differential demodulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345354.pdf","startPage":"1542","endPage":"1546 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOQPSK-differential demodulation of filtered offset QPSK","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Quadrature phase shift keying","Land mobile radio","Channel estimation","Fading","Receivers","Bit error rate","AWGN","Rayleigh channels","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio","mobile radio","demodulation","quadrature phase shift keying","differential phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels","fading","Gaussian noise","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential demodulation","filtered offset QPSK","offset QPSK","OQPSK","digital mobile radio systems","performance","nonlinear channels","/spl pi//4-QPSK","channel estimation","fast fading channels","receiver","bit error rate","/spl pi//4-DQPSK","AWGN","Rayleigh fading linear channels","transmitter","raised cosine pulse shaping","roll off factor","loss","DOQPSK"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"DOQPSK-differential demodulation of filtered offset QPSK","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4864493","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOQPSK-differential demodulation of filtered offset QPSK","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03154S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"4","articleId":"345354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":345355,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.Y.

This family of modulations is based on the FQPSK processor. The main focus of this paper is to present the latest developments and results of FQPSK modulation with 4 signal states. FQPSK which is a constant envelope modulation has been shown to increase the spectral efficiency and capacity by up to 92% over GMSK which is the current modulation for the DECT European standard in mobile cellular communications. It also outperforms PI/4-DEQPSK which is the current modulation standard used in the USA, under IS-54, and Japan, in power efficiency, battery lifetime, and reduced radiation while maintaining equal capacity. To improve further the spectral efficiency of FQPSK, simple baseband processing and filtering strategies are applied. Such baseband processing leads to a spectral efficiency of 1.6 b/s/Hz, and has BER performance of 1*10-2 for a C/I of 18.5 dB in a hardlimited Rayleigh fading channel. To achieve higher spectral efficiency, FQPSK-4/spl times/4 which is a 16 state modulation is proposed. This modulation can be nonlinearly amplified, and is compatible with 16 QAM. FQPSK has been also shown to be compatible with OQPSK, GMSK, and can be demodulated with their receivers with less than 0.5 dB degradation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345358/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4864497","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"FQPSK, power and spectral efficient family of modulations for wireless communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FQPSK, power and spectral efficient family of modulations for wireless communication systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043095S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"3","articleId":"345358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":345360,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is shown that the TDD systems are simpler, can facilitate efficient power control, consume less power and can operate with simpler mobile unit receivers. In the proposed TDD method, both reverse and forward links use the same frequency band and thus have a highly correlated fading pattern. The reciprocity of fading patterns of forward and reverse links provides for a non-feedback power control technique to improve system performance under multipath fading. In systems where the multipaths are created artificially by using multiple antennas, such as indoor distributed antenna systems, the characteristic of the channel as seen by each antenna can be estimated at base station. The best situated antenna can then be selected and used for transmission, creating in effect a pre-selection diversity combining system at the base station. The function of power control is still carried out at mobile units. Computer simulation results show the performance of a power controlled two-path selection diversity to be within 4 dB of static channel performance at bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -4/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","startPage":"1572","endPage":"1576 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345360.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time division duplex transmission of direct sequence spread spectrum signals in multipath channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Time division duplex transmission of direct sequence spread spectrum signals in multipath channels","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4846880","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time division duplex transmission of direct sequence spread spectrum signals in multipath channels","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03897S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"6","articleId":"345360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":345361,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The implication of the results is that not only OFDM signalling increases the system sensitivity to nonlinear distortion and carrier synchronization errors, but it also turns out to offer no performance advantage on fading radio channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4846893","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing for mobile radio applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing for mobile radio applications","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054463S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"169","articleId":"345373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345374,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However a disadvantage of the modulation format is that each transmitted multitone symbol has a non-constant envelope, with large instantaneous power spikes possible. This can lead to non-linear effects in the modulator causing intermodulation distortion and spectral spreading. In this paper the use of a peak power limit (or clip level) is considered for each symbol which can help to maintain linearity. The impact of applying such a clip level is analysed in terms of the symbol error rate (SER) caused on each subchannel, both theoretically and through simulation.

SSEd companders are also verified to be free from any distortions through analysis and computer simulations both for single and dual tone signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345387","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345387.pdf","startPage":"1704","endPage":"1708 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Envelope detection in strict sense and its application to syllabic companders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345387/","displayDocTitle":"Envelope detection in strict sense and its application to syllabic companders","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4846907","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Envelope detection in strict sense and its application to syllabic companders","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065836S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"5","articleId":"345387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":345401,"authors":[{"name":"N.

An originating call also queues if on arrival it finds that the number of available channels is less than or equal to that of the reserved channels. Important performance measures of the system such as forced termination probability, and queue lengths are obtained.

One of the methods, OFDM (\"orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\"), has only been used for broadcasting of digital radio and television and has not previously been used in a multiaccess environment. As OFDM seems to be an attractive alternative to CDMA and TDMA, the authors investigate some methods to make it usable in a multiaccess system. In the downlinks (base to mobile) a transmission scheme, similar to that used in an ordinary broadcasting system, could be used. For the uplinks however, one can not expect the perfect synchronization needed to get the orthogonal carriers necessary for normal OFDM signalling. The authors present a hardware radio system which currently is being developed to test different approaches for multiaccess OFDM. The system will provide a reconfigure tool for the implementation of different synchronization methods, user multiplexing approaches and detection strategies. The system will be built around VME based SUN Sparc stations. The signal processing will be performed by dedicated FFT processors, general purpose digital signal processors and standard ICs for other time critical tasks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1994.345418","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1129/8028/00345418.pdf","startPage":"1843","endPage":"1845 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1994.345418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A system for test of multiaccess methods based on OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345418/","displayDocTitle":"A system for test of multiaccess methods based on OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852295","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A system for test of multiaccess methods based on OFDM","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00345418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032302S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1129","citationCount":"10","articleId":"345418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345421,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Simulation results for a 4.0 kW induction motor and detailed discussion are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1994.345432","pdfPath":"/iel2/1135/8029/00345432.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"725 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1994.345432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IFO control performance considering parameters detuning and rotor speed error","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"IFO control performance considering parameters detuning and rotor speed error","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4840144","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IFO control performance considering parameters detuning and rotor speed error","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00345432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045415S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"3","articleId":"345432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":345438,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Il Yong","affiliation":["Production Engineering Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Il Yong","id":"37651676400"},{"name":"Jong-Woo Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Woo Choi","id":"37336481400"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ki Sul","id":"37267508300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1993-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"345438","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vector control","Induction machines","Frequency estimation","Current measurement","Electrical resistance measurement","Frequency measurement","Load management","Robustness","Stators","Phase estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","machine control","rotors","stators","robust control","control system synthesis","digital control","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction machine","sensorless vector control","rotor angle","terminal voltage","terminal current","computer control","HF current injection","injected d-axis current","robust","stator resistance","parameter estimation","flux phase","flux estimation","performance"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a new approach to estimate the rotor angle of an induction machine from measured terminal voltages and currents using high frequency current injection for sensorless vector control. The proposed scheme is independent of load variation since the rotor angle is derived by using only the injected d-axis current, also it is robust to parameter variation because only the stator resistance is used. Besides, since the strategy depends on only the flux phase, not on the flux magnitude, the rotor angle deviation due to the error of the flux estimation is much less than other schemes. Therefore the performance of vector control at low speed region is considerably improved. The validity of the proposed scheme is confirmed by experimental results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1994.345438","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1135/8029/00345438.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"508 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1994.345438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless vector control of induction machine using high frequency current injection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345438/","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless vector control of induction machine using high frequency current injection","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4840116","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless vector control of induction machine using high frequency current injection","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00345438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037302S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"14","articleId":"345438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345440,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

For field oriented control it is necessary to know the instantaneous magnitude and position of the rotor flux. The magnitude and position of the rotor flux is approximated based on flux measurements in the direct FOC scheme and estimated in the indirect FOC scheme. In this paper a novel flux estimator, the neural network flux estimator, is presented. The neural network is able to estimate accurately the rotor flux magnitude or position (maximum absolute error is less than 0,03 p.u.) for line-start operation of an induction motor. Its ability to estimate flux response that lies outside of the neural network training data set is another one of its strengths. The authors' preliminary work indicates that neural network flux estimation may be a feasible alternative to other flux estimation methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345461/","accessionNumber":"4840127","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A flux estimator for field oriented control of an induction motor using an artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flux estimator for field oriented control of an induction motor using an artificial neural network","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00345461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058077S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"13","articleId":"345461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":345475,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Among various types of brushless DC motors, the salient-pole brushless motor is attractive from two standpoints: torque/current ratio; and feasibilities of sensorless drive and stable starting without a position sensor. Unlike the conventional cylindrical rotor motor, the salient-pole brushless motor produces additional reluctance torque, which improves the torque/current ratio. In addition to that, the winding inductance is a function of rotor position and a novel approach to rotor position estimation is possible without using a position sensor. The paper presents a sensorless drive of a 2.2 kW salient-pole brushless DC motor and emphasis is placed on stable starting by estimating initial rotor position before starting. To estimate initial rotor position, two types of pilot voltages from an inverter are provided. The pilot voltages are rectangular pulsewise DC voltages with different duties and the resultant current peaks are used to estimate the initial rotor position before starting. The proposed algorithm for initial rotor position identification is verified by simulations and experiments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4840101","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","displayDocTitle":"A novel starting method of sensorless salient-pole brushless motor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel starting method of sensorless salient-pole brushless motor","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00345475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025726S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"49","articleId":"345475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":345486,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Vibration monitoring of mechanical bearing frequencies is currently used to detect the presence of a fault condition. Since these mechanical vibrations are associated with variations in the physical air gap of the machine, the air gap flux density is modulated and stator currents are generated at predictable frequencies related to the electrical supply and vibrational frequencies. This paper takes the initial step of investigating the efficacy of current monitoring for bearing fault detection by correlating the relationship between vibration and current frequencies caused by incipient bearing failures. The bearing failure modes are reviewed and the characteristic bearing frequencies associated with the physical construction of the bearings are defined. The effects on the stator current spectrum are described and the related frequencies determined. This is an important result in the formulation of a fault detection scheme that monitors the stator currents. Experimental results which show the vibration and current spectra of an induction machine with different bearing faults are used to verify the relationship between the vibrational and current frequencies. The test results clearly illustrate that the stator current signature can be used to identify the presence of a bearing fault.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1994.345491","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1135/8029/00345491.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"116 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1994.345491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motor bearing damage detection using stator current monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345491/","displayDocTitle":"Motor bearing damage detection using stator current monitoring","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4840085","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motor bearing damage detection using stator current monitoring","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00345491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030099S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"37","articleId":"345491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345493,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Two approaches are compared: the current spectrum analysis and the apparent rotor resistance estimation. For the first approach the authors have developed several procedures based on different fault models of the machine. Their experience is used to approach the parameter estimation method from a theoretical point of view: the resistance variation of the balanced per-phase model is computed using the faulted machine model. It is possible to obtain, by the simulation, the expected resistance variation when some bars break in a specific machine. Moreover the numerical results can be generalized. Using a simplified model of a faulted machine a relationship is obtained, which correlates the apparent resistance variation with the number of broken bars. This relationship needs several assumptions and therefore it is an approximate one, but can be used to define the threshold level for the apparent resistance variation expected in the case of one broken bar. By this relationship it is possible to have an indication on the sensitivity of the parameter estimation approach. The superiority of the current spectrum approach over the parameter estimation approach is shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345493/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4840083","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Broken bar detection in induction machines: comparison between current spectrum approach and parameter estimation approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broken bar detection in induction machines: comparison between current spectrum approach and parameter estimation approach","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00345493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050492S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"46","articleId":"345493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":345496,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The paper discusses effects of this simplification on performance of vector controlled induction machines. Indirect stator, air gap and rotor flux oriented control of a current fed machine are dealt with, with the emphasis on indirect rotor flux oriented control. Models of vector controlled induction machines that account for the iron loss are derived and the mechanism of core loss influence on behaviour of the drives is highlighted. It is shown that detuning caused by neglecting the core loss will inevitably take place. The amount of detuning is investigated for steady-state operation for all the three types of vector control. A new decoupling circuit for indirect rotor flux oriented control is proposed. The circuit accounts for iron loss and eliminates detuning which is otherwise present.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345496/","accessionNumber":"4840080","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impact of iron loss on behaviour of vector controlled induction machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of iron loss on behaviour of vector controlled induction machines","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00345496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037698S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"13","articleId":"345496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":345500,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Underestimates lead to time pressures that may compromise full functional development and thorough testing of software. In contrast, overestimates can result in noncompetitive contract bids and/or over allocation of development resources and personnel. As a result, many models for estimating software development effort have been proposed. This article describes two methods of machine learning, which we use to build estimators of software development effort from historical data. Our experiments indicate that these techniques are competitive with traditional estimators on one dataset, but also illustrate that these methods are sensitive to the data on which they are trained. This cautionary note applies to any model-construction strategy that relies on historical data. All such models for software effort estimation should be evaluated by exploring model sensitivity on a variety of historical data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345828/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4913759","volume":"21","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Machine learning approaches to estimating software development effort","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine learning approaches to estimating software development effort","sourcePdf":"00345828.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022385S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"276","articleId":"345828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":345839,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

Such a scheme, implemented on the uplink ensures that all users' signals arrive at the base station with equal average power as they move within the satellite spot beam-an important requirement in a CDMA system. Because of the lengthy round-trip delay on a satellite link, closed-loop power control systems are only of marginal benefit. Therefore, an open-loop APC scheme is proposed to counteract the effects of shadowing and distance loss. A fairly general channel model, consisting of log-normal shadowing and Rician fading, is assumed. This can be applied to a specific two-state land mobile satellite channel model, involving shadowed intervals with Rayleigh fading and unshadowed intervals with Rician fading. It is found that the power control error can be approximated by a log-normally distributed random variable. To quantify the performance of the APC, the standard deviation of the power control error in decibels is analyzed as a function of the specular power-to-scatter power ratio, the measurement time and the vehicle velocity. To illustrate the usefulness of the results, we analyze the effect of the power control error on the system capacity of a CDMA mobile satellite link.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-loop power control error in a land mobile satellite system","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.345864","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8032/00345864.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.345864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345864/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"Open-loop power control error in a land mobile satellite system","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893290","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-loop power control error in a land mobile satellite system","sourcePdf":"00345864.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027333S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"81","articleId":"345864","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345865,"authors":[{"name":"Yu.T.

The formulas derived in this paper are suitable for various types of signature sequences and chip waveforms. The numerical results are presented for DS-SSMA using BPSK and QPSK with random signature sequences and three different chip waveforms: the rectangular, the cosine, and the root Nyquist filter (RNF) with rolloff rate, /spl beta/=0.4. The results show that the performance of a DS-SSMA system with complex random signature sequences is superior to a system using binary random signature sequences on Gaussian and Rician (K=10) channels, while on flat fading Rayleigh channels the performance for both systems is similar. In DS-SSMA, the RNF has the highest bandwidth efficiency of the three chip waveforms. The performance of DS-SSMA is also analyzed on the SMC using the Gaussian approximation (GA) method. Compared to the estimated results, GA gives a pessimistic approximation for binary random signature sequences on Gaussian and Rician channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.345869","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8032/00345869.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.345869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimated bit-error probability of DS-SSMA/MPSK with coherent detector on satellite mobile channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345869/","displayDocTitle":"Estimated bit-error probability of DS-SSMA/MPSK with coherent detector on satellite mobile channel","volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893295","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimated bit-error probability of DS-SSMA/MPSK with coherent detector on satellite mobile channel","sourcePdf":"00345869.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055524S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","articleId":"345869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":345871,"authors":[{"name":"I.

A noncoherent receiver structure for JFPM signals is introduced, and an exact expression for the probability of a bit error over AWGN channels is obtained. The results show that noncoherent JFPM perform better than M-ary DPSK and/or noncoherent M-ary FSK systems. The power spectral density and the spectral efficiency of JFPM are analyzed. Fractional out-of-band power containment bandwidths are obtained numerically for different JFPM formats. These analytical results show that the power spectral density of JFPM does not contain a discrete component and the same bandwidth efficiency can be obtained by using different JFPM formats.

Computer simulation clarifies that the pre-Viterbi-decoding maximal ratio combining method has better performance than other methods in Rician fading channels. The simulation results agree with the Pe (bit error probability) performance derived from the numerical analysis for slow fading using the approximate Pe performance of Viterbi decoding in AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) channels and the probability density function of Rician fading. Applying this diversity method to the multi-beam mobile satellite communication systems, a satellite beam diversity reception scheme is proposed. A computer simulation result shows that the proposed scheme decreases the packet error rate of the control signals to less than 1/100 around the satellite beam boundary.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.345872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8032/00345872.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.345872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-decision Viterbi decoding with diversity combining for multi-beam mobile satellite communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Soft-decision Viterbi decoding with diversity combining for multi-beam mobile satellite communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345872/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-decision Viterbi decoding with diversity combining for multi-beam mobile satellite communication systems","sourcePdf":"00345872.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038994S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"3","articleId":"345872","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":345873,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The paper addresses an in-depth analysis of these constellations, evaluating both geometrical performance measures and cochannel interference levels caused by extensive frequency reuse. The geometrical analysis yields the statistics for coverage, frequency of satellite hand-overs, and link absence periods. The interference analysis is based on a general model valid for all access techniques, which is here applied to the case of FDMA. The outage probability as a function of the specification on carrier-to-interference power ratio is evaluated for four selected constellations. Several techniques are introduced for interference reduction in non-GEO systems, in which the satellites coverage areas may intersect: spot turnoff, intraorbital plane frequency division, and interorbital plane frequency division. The effects of Rice fading have also been analyzed by means of an analytic approximated method.

Up to now, the improvement of bit error rate at the receiver side has been carried out through the bandwidth optimization of the IF filter, the decision feedback equalization (DFE), or simple two-state maximum likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE). This channel is inherently the intersymbol interference (ISI) channel due to the premodulation baseband filtering as well as the narrowband IF filtering. So the sequence estimation scheme using the Viterbi algorithm can be applied successfully, although the channel is not additive white Gaussian and maximum likelihood in the strict sense. In this paper, through computer simulations, we examine the actual BER improvement of the sequence estimation scheme with multiple-state trellis especially for MSK and GMSK signals. We mainly consider static AWGN and frequency nonselective Rician fading channels. Consequently, by adjusting the IF filter bandwidth, very large estimation gains are obtained compared to the conventional DFE or MLSE detector for AWGN and Rician fading channels. This scheme does not produce large demodulation delay and is implemented only by adding the signal processing part to the final stage of the receiver. This scheme seems to be very useful for any applications including satellite mobile channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.345875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8032/00345875.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.345875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032","startPage":"310","endPage":"315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of sequence estimation scheme of narrowband digital FM signals with limiter-discriminator detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of sequence estimation scheme of narrowband digital FM signals with limiter-discriminator detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345875/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893301","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of sequence estimation scheme of narrowband digital FM signals with limiter-discriminator detection","sourcePdf":"00345875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044442S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"9","articleId":"345875","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345876,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Rong Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Rong Chang","id":"37287470000"},{"name":"Bor-Chin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bor-Chin Wang","id":"37292891200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"345876","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Satellite broadcasting","Phase shift keying","Intersymbol interference","Multi-layer neural network","Adaptive equalizers","Multilayer perceptrons","Time division multiple access","Additive white noise","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication","satellite communication","adaptive equalisers","decision feedback equalisers","telecommunication channels","multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","time division multiple access","white noise","Gaussian noise","intersymbol interference","backpropagation","phase shift keying","adaptive signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital satellite channel","multilayer neural networks","adaptive decision feedback equalization","multilayer perceptron","M-ary PSK signal","TDMA satellite radio channel","intersymbol interference","ISI","additive white Gaussian noise","transmitter amplifiers","nonlinearities","transmitted signal sequence detection","complex PSK signal","complex-valued nonlinear MPSK satellite channel","computational complexity","modified back-propagation algorithm","convergence properties","delta-bar-delta rule","simulation results","QPSK satellite channels","bit error rate performance","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces an adaptive decision feedback equalization using the multilayer perceptron structure of an M-ary PSK signal through a TDMA satellite radio channel. The transmission is disturbed not only by intersymbol interference (ISI) and additive white Gaussian noise, but also by the nonlinearity of transmitter amplifiers. The conventional decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is not well-suited to detect the transmitted sequence, whereas the neural-based DFE is able to take into account the nonlinearities and therefore to detect the signal much better. Nevertheless, the applications of the traditional multilayer neural networks have been limited to real-valued signals. To overcome this difficulty, a neural-based DFE is proposed to deal with the complex PSK signal over the complex-valued nonlinear MPSK satellite channel without performing time-consuming complex-valued back-propagation training algorithms, while maintaining almost the same computational complexity as the original real-valued training algorithm. Moreover, a modified back-propagation algorithm with better convergence properties is derived on the basis of delta-bar-delta rule. Simulation results for the equalization of QPSK satellite channels show that the neural-based DFE provides a superior bit error rate performance relative to the conventional mean square DFE, especially in poor signal-to-noise ratio conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.345876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8032/00345876.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.345876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive decision feedback equalization for digital satellite channels using multilayer neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345876/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive decision feedback equalization for digital satellite channels using multilayer neural networks","volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893302","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive decision feedback equalization for digital satellite channels using multilayer neural networks","sourcePdf":"00345876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052117S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"31","articleId":"345876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345877,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Primarily considered for the noteworthy features of low power flux density emission and robustness to interference and multipath, CDMA is known to bear reduced bandwidth and power efficiency when compared to traditional TDMA and FDMA due to the intrinsic cochannel self-noise. Early attempts to increase the capacity of CDMA-based systems for commercial applications relied on voice activation and frequency reuse. More recently, practical solutions to implement (synchronous) orthogonal CDMA signaling are being developed independently in Europe and in the USA. This paper is focused on the comparative performance analysis of those two orthogonal CDMA schemes in the operating renditions of a mobile satellite communications system. In particular, the two CDMA systems are compared in the presence of that and frequency-selective multipath fading and a typical satellite transponder nonlinearity.

The power efficiency and spectrum efficiency of this system are investigated in a nonlinear amplified (NLA) environment. The bit error rate (BER) performance is evaluated in a noisy Rayleigh fading channel. We demonstrate that with the simplest threshold detectors (binary robust eye diagrams in I and Q channels), this system is 4-7 dB more power efficient than the US digital cellular and Japanese Handyphone standard /spl pi//4-QPSK (50%-100% more spectrally efficient than the recently adopted wireless local area network (LAN) standard GFSK and the European standard GMSK). The results indicate that the proposed DJ filtered FQPSK is a power and spectrally efficient modem/radio technique.

Based upon a metric which has been previously derived by the authors, we present analytical expressions and computer generated results for the performance of asymptotically optimal noncoherent detection over such channels. As a typical application of the developed theoretical analysis, we consider wideband telecommunication systems. Where time dispersion resulting in intersymbol interference (ISI) is one of the significant sources of system performance degradation. Numerical evaluation of the optimal noncoherent decoding algorithms, shows the proposed bounds to be an effective and efficient means of evaluating the performance of the noncoherent receivers under investigation. Using the derived bounds, performance evaluation results for modulation schemes such as /spl pi//4-shift DQPSK (differential quadrature phase shift keying), 8- and 16-DQAM (differential quadrature amplitude modulation), at very low bit-error rates (BER), which would otherwise pose impractically high computational loads when using Monte-Carlo error counting techniques, are readily obtained.

However, many problems are to be solved before the final operation of such networks. This paper deals with basic design problems of LEO/ICO-based networks. The topology of the satellite network is considered and estimates for the number of satellites necessary, orbits and number of communication channels per satellite are derived. The features and consequences of intersatellite links are discussed. The number of communication channels per link is derived with a more elaborate model. This includes the radio links from the satellites to mobile users and to gateways, as well as intersatellite links and terrestrial lines. We introduce a formal model for LEO/ICO based networks and propose a method for the evaluation of the link capacities, given the network topology and the traffic requirements. As an example, two constellations are investigated in detail. One of these constellations is the Iridium system proposed by Motorola, the other is the LEONET concept developed in an ESA study. Finally, the influence of unequal traffic distribution is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.345881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8032/00345881.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.345881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032","startPage":"371","endPage":"381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of system parameters for LEO/ICO-satellite communication networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of system parameters for LEO/ICO-satellite communication networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893307","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of system parameters for LEO/ICO-satellite communication networks","sourcePdf":"00345881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044239S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"76","articleId":"345881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345882,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.J. van Nee","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Traffic-Control Systems Group, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"R.D.J.","lastName":"van Nee","id":"37347315800"},{"name":"R.N. van Wolfswinkel","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Traffic-Control Systems Group, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"R.N.","lastName":"van Wolfswinkel","id":"37347318200"},{"name":"R.

The system can include a terrestrial segment and a space segment. The terrestrial trail segment, consisting of microcells and macrocells, provides high channel capacity by covering service areas with microcells. Overlaying macrocells cover spots that are difficult in radio propagation for microcells and provide overflow groups of channels for clusters of microcells. At the highest hierarchical level, communications satellites comprise a space segment. The satellite beams overlay clusters of terrestrial macrocells and provide primary access for satellite-only subscribers. Call attempts from cellular/satellite dual subscribers are first directed to the terrestrial cellular network, with satellites providing necessary overlay. At each level of the hierarchy, hand-off calls are given priority access to the channels. The mathematical structure is that of a multilayer hierarchical overflow system. An analytical model for teletraffic performance (including hand-off) is developed. Theoretical performance measures are calculated for users having different mobility characteristics. These show the carried traffic, traffic distribution, blocking, and forced termination probabilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.345885","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8032/00345885.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.345885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032","startPage":"406","endPage":"415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personal communication systems using multiple hierarchical cellular overlays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Personal communication systems using multiple hierarchical cellular overlays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345885/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893311","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personal communication systems using multiple hierarchical cellular overlays","sourcePdf":"00345885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051289S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"112","articleId":"345885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":345886,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Shiang Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Directorate General of Telecommunication Laboratories, Ministry of Transporation and Communications, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Min-Shiang Hwang","id":"37287615200"},{"name":"Wei-Pan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wei-Pan Yang","id":"37348568100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"345886","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Authentication","Public key cryptography","Communication system security","Telecommunication computing","Satellite communication","Information science","Data privacy","Telephony","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio","mobile satellite communication","data privacy","message authentication","cryptography","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conference key distribution","secure digital mobile communications","secure conference","privacy","authentication","public channel","secret key","mobile satellite communication","cryptography","protocol"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new service for digital mobile communication systems.

A modified packet demand assignment multiple access (PDAMA) protocol with better characteristics is proposed and analyzed. Using simulation with approximate analysis, the performance of the modified PDAMA is compared with that of a modified random-access protocol as well as the original PDAMA in terms of delay and throughput. For small packet arrival rate, the performance of the proposed access protocol is shown to be similar to that of the modified random-access protocol, and better than that of the PDAMA protocol. While the packet arrival rate increases, the performance of the proposed access protocol is improved greatly compared with that of the PDAMA protocol.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8032/00345888.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.345888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.345888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified PDAMA protocol for mobile satellite communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite communication","Access protocols","Delay","Throughput","Performance analysis","Mobile communication","Time division multiple access","Analytical models","Artificial satellites","Satellite ground stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile satellite communication","demand assigned multiple access","packet switching","delays","approximation theory","simulation","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified PDAMA protocol","mobile satellite communication systems","random multiple access protocol","reservation multiple-access protocols","simulation","approximate analysis","performance","modified random-access protocol","delay","throughput","packet arrival rate","packet demand assignment multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"A modified PDAMA protocol for mobile satellite communication systems","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893314","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified PDAMA protocol for mobile satellite communication systems","sourcePdf":"00345888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031029S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","articleId":"345888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":345889,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In all of these studies, uniform distribution of traffic load is assumed. In this paper, the performance of a low Earth-orbit satellite communication system which is designed to service to two kinds of users; i.e., voice users and data users is estimated. The distribution of population of these users is assumed to be nonuniform. According to the simulation results, it is shown that the nonuniformity in traffic affects the performance of the system by decreasing the signal quality at the satellite which has to service to populated areas and increasing it superfluously at the satellite with not so populated service area, in a given period of time. By modeling the satellites during their movements, the change in signal quality while experiencing a peak of traffic load in their route is also determined. A modified power control method based on the amount of traffic load of each satellite is also examined and is shown that this method can make some performance improvements in signal quality, which is limited by special features of low Earth-orbit satellite systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of an integrated voice/data system in nonuniform traffic low Earth-orbit satellite communication systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.345892","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8032/00345892.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.345892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance of an integrated voice/data system in nonuniform traffic low Earth-orbit satellite communication systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893318","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of an integrated voice/data system in nonuniform traffic low Earth-orbit satellite communication systems","sourcePdf":"00345892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049486S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"17","articleId":"345892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":345912,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper introduces compliant linkage, a new concept in the control and kinematic design of multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) mobile robots. As the name implies, compliant linkage provides compliance between the drive wheels or drive axles of a vehicle, to accommodate control errors which would otherwise cause wheel slippage. The concept of compliant linkage was implemented and tested on a 4-DOF vehicle built at the University of Michigan's Mobile Robotics Lab. Experimental results show that control errors are effectively absorbed by the linkage, resulting in smooth and precise motion. The dead-reckoning accuracy of the compliant linkage vehicle is substantially better than that reported in the literature for other MDOF vehicles; it was found equal to, or even better than that of comparable 2-DOF vehicles.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345935/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4914734","volume":"11","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Control and kinematic design of multi-degree-of freedom mobile robots with compliant linkage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control and kinematic design of multi-degree-of freedom mobile robots with compliant linkage","sourcePdf":"00345935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047607S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"97","articleId":"345935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":345937,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

MVP automatically synthesizes desirable camera views of a scene based on geometric models of the environment, optical models of the vision sensors, and models of the task to be achieved. The generic task of feature detectability has been chosen since it is applicable to many robot-controlled vision systems. For such a task, features of interest in the environment are required to simultaneously be visible, inside the field of view, in focus, and magnified as required. In this paper, we present a technique that poses the vision sensor planning problem in an optimization setting and determines viewpoints that satisfy all previous requirements simultaneously and with a margin. In addition, we present experimental results of this technique when applied to a robotic vision system that consists of a camera mounted on a robot manipulator in a hand-eye configuration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor systems","Robot sensing systems","Robot vision systems","Machine vision","Robotics and automation","Solid modeling","Cameras","Optical sensors","Layout","Geometrical optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot vision","image sensors","planning (artificial intelligence)","feature extraction","constraint handling","computational geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine vision planner","model-based vision sensor planning system","robotic vision","camera views","geometric models","optical models","feature detectability","hand-eye configuration"]}],"doi":"10.1109/70.345939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/8034/00345939.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.345939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The MVP sensor planning system for robotic vision tasks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The MVP sensor planning system for robotic vision tasks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345939/","volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4914738","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The MVP sensor planning system for robotic vision tasks","sourcePdf":"00345939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055424S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"107","articleId":"345939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":345940,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

The problem can be summarized as follows: given information about the environment as well as information about the task that the vision system is to accomplish, develop strategies to automatically determine sensor parameter values that achieve this task with a certain degree of satisfaction. With such strategies, sensor parameters values can be selected and can be purposefully changed in order to effectively perform the task at hand. The focus here is on vision sensor planning for the task of robustly detecting object features. For this task, camera and illumination parameters such as position, orientation, and optical settings are determined so that object features are, for example, visible, in focus, within the sensor field of view, magnified as required, and imaged with sufficient contrast. References to, and a brief description of, representative sensing strategies for the tasks of object recognition and scene reconstruction are also presented. For these tasks, sensor configurations are sought that will prove most useful when trying to identify an object or reconstruct a scene.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/8034/00345940.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.345940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.345940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=345940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of sensor planning in computer vision","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Optical sensors","Object recognition","Layout","Image reconstruction","Machine vision","Sensor systems","Robustness","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image sensors","planning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision sensor planning","computer vision","sensor parameter selection","object feature detection","focussing","object recognition","scene reconstruction","sensor configurations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/345940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"A survey of sensor planning in computer vision","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4914739","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of sensor planning in computer vision","sourcePdf":"00345940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074353S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"292","articleId":"345940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":345941,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.H.

This issue of deadlocks has not been addressed in many previously proposed multicast algorithms. We also show that deadlocks on consumption channels can be avoided by using multiple classes of consumption channels and restricting the use of consumption channels by multicast messages. In addition, we present a new multicast routing algorithm, column-path, which uses the well-known e-cube algorithm for multicast routing. Therefore, this algorithm could be implemented in the existing multicomputers with minimal hardware support. We present a simulation study of the performance of Hamilton-path based multicast algorithms with the proposed column-path algorithm. Our simulations indicate that the simplistic scheme of sending one copy of a multicast message to each of its destinations exhibits good performance and that the new column-path algorithm offers higher throughput compared to the Hamilton-path based algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 6th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/999/8037/00346103.pdf","startPage":"722","endPage":"729","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 6th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1994.346103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1994.346103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8037","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On multicast wormhole routing in multicomputer networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Intelligent networks","Multicast algorithms","System recovery","Broadcasting","Hypercubes","Unicast","Multicast communication","Parallel machines","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor interconnection networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast wormhole routing","multicomputer networks","deadlocks","consumption channels","multicast algorithms","column-path","e-cube algorithm","minimal hardware support","simulation study","Hamilton-path based multicast algorithms","column-path algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/346103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"On multicast wormhole routing in multicomputer networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4818498","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On multicast wormhole routing in multicomputer networks","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00346103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038229S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"999","citationCount":"28","articleId":"346103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":346105,"authors":[{"name":"M.Z.

This limiting factor is more predominant in distributed systems such as clusters of homogeneous or heterogeneous workstations. However, excessive communication overhead can be reduced by redundantly executing some of the tasks of a parallel program on which other tasks critically depend. We study the problem of duplication-based static scheduling of parallel programs on parallel and distributed systems. Previous duplication-based scheduling algorithms assumed the availability of unlimited number of homogeneous processors. We consider more practical scenarios: when the number of processors is limited, and when the system consists of heterogeneous computers. For the first scenario, we propose an algorithm which minimizes the execution of a parallel program by controlling the level of duplication according to the number of processors available. For the second scenario, we design an algorithm which simultaneously exploits duplication and processor heterogeneity to minimize the total execution time of a parallel program.

We show that vectorization can nevertheless more than quadruple the performance on our modeled supercomputer. Pushing several patterns at a time through the network (batch mode) exposes an extra degree of parallelism which allows us to improve the performance by an additional factor of 4.

Although many methods exist for nested loop partitioning, most of these perform poorly when parallelizing nested loops with irregular dependencies. We apply the results of classical convex theory and principles of linear programming to iteration spaces and show the correspondence between minimum dependence distance computation and iteration space tiling. The cross-iteration dependencies are analyzed by forming an Integer Dependence Convex Hull (IDCH). A simple way to compute minimum dependence distances from the dependence distance vectors of the extreme points of the IDCH is presented. Using these minimum dependence distances the iteration space can be tiled. Iterations in a tile can be executed in parallel and the tiles can be executed with proper synchronization. We demonstrate that our technique gives much better speedup and extracts more parallelism than the existing techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1994.346179","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 6th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 6th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/999/8037/00346179.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1994.346179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum dependence distance tiling of nested loops with non-uniform dependences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/346179/","displayDocTitle":"Minimum dependence distance tiling of nested loops with non-uniform dependences","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4818421","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum dependence distance tiling of nested loops with non-uniform dependences","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00346179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024248S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"999","citationCount":"18","articleId":"346179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":346184,"authors":[{"name":"Shyh-Chang Lin","affiliation":["Genetic Algorithm Research and Applications Group, Case Center and Department of Computer Science, Michigan State University, USA"],"lastName":"Shyh-Chang Lin","id":"37653678200"},{"name":"W.F.

These approaches are evaluated on a graph partitioning problem. Our experiments showed, first, that the sequential GA's used are not as effective as parallel GA's for this graph partition problem. Second, for coarse-grain GA's, the results indicate that using a large number of nodes and exchanging individuals asynchronously among them is very effective. Third, GA's that exchange solutions based on population similarity instead of a fixed connection topology get better results without any degradation in speed. Finally, we propose a new coarse-grained GA architecture, the Injection Island GA (iiGA).

A major difficulty with these methods is acquiring and trading the requisite feature points, which are generally specific joints such as knees or angles. This requires previous recognition and/or part segmentation of the actor. We show that the recognition of walking or any repetitive motion activity can be accomplished on the basis of bottom up processing, which does not require the prior identification of specific parts, or classification of the actor. In particular, we demonstrate that repetitive motion is such a strong cue, that the moving actor can be segmented, normalized spatially and temporally, and recognized by matching against a spatiotemporal template of motion features. We have implemented a real-time system that can recognize and classify repetitive motion activities in normal gray-scale image sequences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MNRAO.1994.346251","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on Motion of Non-rigid and Articulated Objects","pdfPath":"/iel2/1000/8038/00346251.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNRAO.1994.346251","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on Motion of Non-rigid and Articulated Objects","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low level recognition of human motion (or how to get your man without finding his body parts)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Low level recognition of human motion (or how to get your man without finding his body parts)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/346251/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4824212","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-12 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low level recognition of human motion (or how to get your man without finding his body parts)","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00346251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037323S","chronDate":"11-12 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1000","citationCount":"118","articleId":"346251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":346253,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

Several visualization methods have been developed to address this problem, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. This paper describes a system named XmdvTool which integrates several of the most common methods for projecting multivariate data onto a two-dimensional screen. This integration allows users to explore their data in a variety of formats with ease. A view enhancement mechanism called an N-dimensional brush is also described. The brush allows users to gain insights into spatial relationships over N dimensions by highlighting data which falls within a user-specified subspace.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346302","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1007/8039/00346302.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"XmdvTool: integrating multiple methods for visualizing multivariate data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/346302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"XmdvTool: integrating multiple methods for visualizing multivariate data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4812262","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"XmdvTool: integrating multiple methods for visualizing multivariate data","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00346302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037859S","chronDate":"17-21 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1007","citationCount":"172","articleId":"346302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":346331,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

This paper is concerned with interpolation methods that are equivalent to convolving the samples with a reconstruction filter; this covers all commonly used schemes, including trilinear and cubic interpolation. We first outline the formal basis of interpolation in three-dimensional signal processing theory. We then propose numerical metrics that can be used to measure filter characteristics that are relevant to the appearance of images generated using that filter. We apply those metrics to several previously used filters and relate the results to isosurface images of the interpolations. We show that the choice of interpolation scheme can have a dramatic effect on image quality, and we discuss the cost/benefit tradeoff inherent in choosing a filter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346331","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1007/8039/00346331.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"107","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evaluation of reconstruction filters for volume rendering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"An evaluation of reconstruction filters for volume rendering","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4812233","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/346331/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evaluation of reconstruction filters for volume rendering","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00346331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028279S","chronDate":"17-21 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1007","citationCount":"125","articleId":"346331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":346332,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Tao","affiliation":["NSF Engineering Research Center for Computational Field Simulation, Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"lastName":"Hai Tao","id":"37652845200"},{"name":"R.J.

Most data sets in scientific visualization, whether created by measurement or simulation, are usually voluminous. The goal of data management is to reduce the storage space and the access time of these data sets to speed up the visualization process. A new progressive transmission scheme using spline biorthogonal wavelet bases is proposed in this paper. By exploiting the properties of this set of wavelet bases, a fast algorithm involving only additions and subtractions is developed. Due to the multiresolutional nature of the wavelet transform, this scheme is compatible with hierarchical-structured rendering algorithms. The formula for reconstructing the functional values in a continuous volume space is given in a simple polynomial form. Lossless compression is possible, even when using floating-point numbers. This algorithm has been applied to data from a global ocean model. The lossless compression ratio is about 1.5:1. With a compression ratio of 50:1, the reconstructed data is still of good quality. Several other wavelet bases are compared with the spline biorthogonal wavelet bases. Finally the reconstructed data is visualized using various algorithms and the results are demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive transmission of scientific data using biorthogonal wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '94","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346332","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1007/8039/00346332.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/346332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Progressive transmission of scientific data using biorthogonal wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4812232","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive transmission of scientific data using biorthogonal wavelet transform","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00346332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048212S","chronDate":"17-21 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1007","citationCount":"14","articleId":"346332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":346407,"authors":[{"name":"S.-S.

The networks were optimized to minimize both learning and prediction error. The optimal neural process models were then used for recipe synthesis to generate the proper deposition conditions to obtain specific film properties.

One such feature and three appropriate architectures are the focus of this paper.

Using a protein with three anti-cancer drugs in our model, our algorithm can find a binding structure with a complicated energy computation within a couple of hours and the experimental results indicate that the solutions are reasonable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TAI.1994.346464","startPage":"404","endPage":"410","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence.

Further speedups are possible by customizing parallel formulations to the architecture of the neural network. The paper addresses the issue of customizing parallel formulations of the backpropagation learning algorithm to a given neural network architecture on multiprocessors with hypercube-like communication topology. We introduce a new parallel formulation called rectangular checkerboarding which adapts to the network architecture and can provide performance gains for non-uniform neural networks, where the number of nodes vary across the layers. Algebraic analysis shows that each instance of rectangular checkerboarding (using a specific rectangular processor grid) is optimal for an important family of network architectures. Experiments on CM-5 show that customizing to network architecture can provide significant (/spl sim/50%) performance gains for many interesting non-uniform neural network architectures, which are currently used in important applications. We also introduce the staircase framework, which can use different processor grids for different layers of a neural network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TAI.1994.346497","startPage":"181","endPage":"189","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence.

The method is based upon a search technique using genetic algorithms. Traditional structural optimization techniques consider it continuous search space, and consequently lead to unrealistic solutions because structural members are not available in continuously varying sizes. A practical method should consider only the discrete values associated with commonly available materials. On the other hand, most modern structural optimization techniques, even when they consider a discrete search space, suffer a lack of generality, and tend to be limited to a certain kind of structure. Genetic algorithms remedy these two problems since they can deal with discrete search spaces and they are general enough to be easily extended to any kind of structure without substantial modifications. Our results show the genetic algorithm can provide very good solutions, often surpassing other complex and specialized techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence.

The average shift was believed to be attributed to the inhomogeneity of channel potential due to the discreteness of channel dopants, and the logarithmic dependence of subthreshold current. Microscopic dopant distribution also gave rise to asymmetry in drain current upon interchanging the source and the drain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1088/8045/00347215.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"708","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1993.347215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1993.347215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8045","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=347215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional \"atomistic\" simulation of discrete random dopant distribution effects in sub-0.1 /spl mu/m MOSFET's","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doping","MOSFET circuits","Threshold voltage","Fluctuations","Microscopy","Power supplies","Subthreshold current","Silicon","Geometry","Charge carrier density"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulated gate field effect transistors","semiconductor device models","doping profiles","semiconductor doping","diffusion in solids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional atomistic simulation","discrete random dopant distribution","sub-0.1 micron MOSFETs","fluctuation","threshold voltage","drift-diffusion","channel potential inhomogeneity","subthreshold current","drain current","0.1 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/347215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional \"atomistic\" simulation of discrete random dopant distribution effects in sub-0.1 /spl mu/m MOSFET's","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4811074","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional \"atomistic\" simulation of discrete random dopant distribution effects in sub-0.1 /spl mu/m MOSFET's","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00347215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032073S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","isNumber":"8045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1088","citationCount":"80","articleId":"347215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":347221,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Thin but undepleted SOI is used as the substrate, which gives low junction capacitance and no body effect. Furthermore floating body effects causes a reduction of subthreshold slope at high drain bias. This lowers the high-V/sub DS/ threshold to be used, which increases the current drive without significant increase in the off-current. This technology was applied to a high performance 512 Kb SRAM. Access time of 3.5 ns at 1 V was obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1088/8045/00347275.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOI for a 1-volt CMOS technology and application to a 512 Kb SRAM with 3.5 ns access time","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1993.347275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1993.347275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=347275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/347275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","displayDocTitle":"SOI for a 1-volt CMOS technology and application to a 512 Kb SRAM with 3.5 ns access time","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4805287","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SOI for a 1-volt CMOS technology and application to a 512 Kb SRAM with 3.5 ns access time","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00347275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041758S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","isNumber":"8045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1088","citationCount":"28","articleId":"347275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":347276,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Two pull-down transistors and two access transistors are fabricated employing two separate gate formations. A pair of split word-lines is stacked over pull-down transistors. That permits large cell ratio in small cell area and independent optimization of pull-down and access transistors. Threshold voltage of access transistors is lowered to improve cell stability. Top gate thin film polysilicon transistor and Vcc plate are used to make cell node capacitor and improve soft error immunity.

Another new technique, which stabilizes the one-electron stored state, is ultra-thin (4 nm) poly-Si film for the active region, in which an array of 10-nm grains are naturally formed. In the fabricated poly-Si TFTs a single electron is systematically stored (or \"written\") with every 15-V gate-voltage increase, and the number of stored electrons is counted (or \"read\") by the quantized threshold-voltage shift.

We report here on RSCE in transistors which have very shallow or flat channel profiles, where such broadening cannot be the mechanism. It is shown that for several different dopings and process sequences, both RSCE and anomalous body effects can be traced back to transient enhanced diffusion (TED) of the channel profile induced by source/drain implantation. A new mechanism for RSCE is proposed, in which the surface recombination of interstitials under the gate gives rise to an impurity flux to the surface, which raises the threshold. A coupled defect/impurity diffusion model allows all short channel effects on threshold to be accurately predicted.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1993.347345","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1088/8045/00347345.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1993.347345","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","startPage":"311","endPage":"314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explanation of reverse short channel effect by defect gradients","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=347345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Explanation of reverse short channel effect by defect gradients","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/347345/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4805217","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explanation of reverse short channel effect by defect gradients","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00347345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054725S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","isNumber":"8045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1088","citationCount":"54","articleId":"347345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":347361,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The resulting 40 nm gate length n-MOSFETs operate quite normally at room temperature. Even in the sub-50 nm region, short-channel effects-V/sub th/ shift and S-factor degradation-are suppressed very well. The impact ionization rate falls significantly as Vd falls below 1.5 V.

Limits on active power are pushing the power supply voltage, V/sub DD/, downward, while increased MOSFET count is creating pressure to increase threshold-voltage, V/sub T/, to keep passive power (sub-threshold leakage) from growing. A conflict between the needs for lower V/sub DD/ and higher V/sub T/ thus arises. Power constraints alone, independent of other potential limitations, will lead to maximum performance at the 100-nm lithographic scale of approximately two to three times that of 0.5-/spl mu/m, 3.3 V CMOS technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1993.347386","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1088/8045/00347386.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1993.347386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8045","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=347386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultimate CMOS ULSI performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultimate CMOS ULSI performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/347386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4805176","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultimate CMOS ULSI performance","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00347386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021517S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","isNumber":"8045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1088","citationCount":"20","articleId":"347386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":347393,"authors":[{"name":"E.F.

In this work we investigate the leverage of SiGe HBTs for analog circuits by optimizing the Ge-profile for a high /spl beta/V/sub A/ product and high f/sub T/ under the constraint of breakdown voltage and effective strain of the SiGe layer. Analytical calculations of /spl beta/, V/sub A/, and f/sub T/ of SiGe-HBTs as a function of Ge profile predict the largest performance advantage over Si BJTs for the most steeply graded Ge profile. SiGe-HBT transistors are fabricated with /spl beta/V/sub A/ products of 6160 V, BV/sub CEO/ of 3.5 V and f/sub max/ of 46 GHz, and compared to Si-BJTs fabricated with the same process. Digital performance is benchmarked by an ECL ring oscillator delay of 17.2 psec. The leverage for analog technology is demonstrated by fabrication of a 1 GHz SiGe-HBT 12 bit Digital to Analog Convertor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1088/8045/00347396.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"74","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1993.347396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1993.347396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8045","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=347396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of SiGe HBT technology for high speed analog and mixed-signal applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon germanium","Germanium silicon alloys","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Delay","Analog circuits","Digital circuits","Constraint optimization","Capacitive sensors","Performance analysis","Ring oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterojunction bipolar transistors","bipolar integrated circuits","linear integrated circuits","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","semiconductor materials","Ge-Si alloys","digital-analogue conversion","integrated circuit technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SiGe HBT technology","high speed analog circuits","mixed-signal circuits","optimization","Ge-profile","breakdown voltage","effective strain","cut off frequency","ECL ring oscillator","fabrication","Digital to Analog Convertor","46 GHz","1 GHz","12 bit","SiGe"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/347396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of SiGe HBT technology for high speed analog and mixed-signal applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4805166","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of SiGe HBT technology for high speed analog and mixed-signal applications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00347396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054294S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","isNumber":"8045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1088","citationCount":"54","articleId":"347396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":347399,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

To clarify the relation between the degradation and oxide damage such as interface-states and oxide charges, the charge-pumping (CP) technique, transconductance (G/sub m/) measurements and cell endurance measurements are performed. In the degradation, a reduction of electron injection into the floating gate and a reduction of the G/sub m/ should be considered separately. The reduction of electron injection into the floating gate is found to be caused mainly by the interface-states located in the drain overlap region, not by charges trapped in the oxide. These interface-states are created during the initial step of program operation. On the contrary, a reduction of G/sub m/ is caused mainly by interface-states located around the drain edge. These are created during the final step of program operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/347407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4805155","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Degradation mechanism of flash EEPROM programming after program/erase cycles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation mechanism of flash EEPROM programming after program/erase cycles","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00347407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033284S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 1993","isNumber":"8045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1088","citationCount":"53","articleId":"347407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":347408,"authors":[{"name":"Y.S.

Four types of MMIC transceiver components-low noise amplifiers, power amplifiers, mixers, and voltage controlled oscillators-were processed on the same PHEMT wafer, and all were fabricated using a common gate recess process. High performance and high producibility for all four MMIC components was achieved through the optimization of the device epitaxial structure, a process with wide margins for critical process steps and circuit designs that allow for anticipated process variations, resulting in significant performance margins. We obtained excellent results for the Ka-band power amplifier: greater than 26 dBm output power at center frequency with 4.0% standard deviation over the 3-in. wafer, 2-GHz bandwidth, greater than 20 pet-cent power-added efficiency, over 8 dB associated gain, and over 10 dB linear gain. The best performance for the Ka-band LNA was over 17 dB gain and 3.5 dB noise figure at Ka-band.

The treatment of the ferrite material is based on the equation of motion of the magnetization vector. Magnetic losses are also included in the equation of motion by means of Gilbert's approximation of the phenomenological Landau-Lifschitz damping term. The discretization scheme is based on central finite-differences and linear interpolation. This scheme allows the fully explicit nature of the FDTD method to be maintained. This extension of the FDTD method to magnetized ferrites is applied to the full-wave analysis of ferrite-loaded waveguides. The dispersion curves are calculated by using a recently proposed 2D-FDTD formulation for dispersion analysis which has been adapted to the present problem. The results for both the phase and attenuation constants of various transversely and longitudinally magnetized ferrite-loaded waveguides are compared with the exact values and with those obtained by means of Schelkunoff's method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8052/00348095.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.348095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.348095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8052","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=348095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD analysis of magnetized ferrites: application to the calculation of dispersion characteristics of ferrite-loaded waveguides","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Magnetic analysis","Ferrites","Magnetic materials","Equations","Magnetization","Vectors","Magnetic losses","Damping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","finite difference time-domain analysis","ferrites","ferrite-loaded waveguides","magnetic leakage","magnetisation","waveguide theory","dispersion (wave)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD analysis","magnetized ferrites","dispersion characteristics","ferrite-loaded waveguides","finite-difference time-domain method","ferrite material","magnetization vector","equation of motion","magnetic losses","Gilbert approximation","Landau-Lifschitz damping term","discretization scheme","linear interpolation","full-wave analysis","2D-FDTD formulation","dispersion analysis","phase constants","attenuation constants"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/348095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"FDTD analysis of magnetized ferrites: application to the calculation of dispersion characteristics of ferrite-loaded waveguides","volume":"43","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893700","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD analysis of magnetized ferrites: application to the calculation of dispersion characteristics of ferrite-loaded waveguides","sourcePdf":"00348095.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051565S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"60","articleId":"348095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":348096,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Chen","affiliation":["High Frequency Electronics Laboratory, the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"lastName":"Qiang Chen","id":"37290090500"},{"name":"V.F.

First, the recently reported dispersive boundary condition (DEC) is modified thereby enabling the absorbing boundary to be located near to the main field area; second, an exact source plane field distribution itself produced by the FDTD algorithm is adopted to improve numerical accuracy. This leads to a reduction in computer memory requirements. As an example, a full-wave 3D FDTD analysis of a slotline is performed on a 33 MHz PC486. The dispersion characteristic of the slotline is presented up to 1000 GHz this agrees well with that of closed form formula. When compared with previous slotline solutions, frequency range results are extended by an octave and less than 9 percent of the computer memory previously required is demanded. The unique and highly efficient combination of the two strategies presented here could be applied to other microwave waveguide component analyses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three dimensional finite-difference time-domain slotline analysis on a limited memory personal computer","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.348096","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8052/00348096.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.348096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8052","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=348096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/348096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"Three dimensional finite-difference time-domain slotline analysis on a limited memory personal computer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893701","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three dimensional finite-difference time-domain slotline analysis on a limited memory personal computer","sourcePdf":"00348096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025506S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"5","articleId":"348096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":348102,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Yan Zhu","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"lastName":"Ning Yan Zhu","id":"37266820300"},{"name":"F.M.

We now extend this work using an inflation technique to estimate all or some of the orthogonal eigenvectors of the given matrix. Based on these results, we form a cost function for the finite data case and derive a Newton-based adaptive algorithm. The inflation technique leads to a highly modular and parallel structure for implementation. The computational requirement of the algorithm is O(N/sup 2/), N being the size of the covariance matrix. We also present a rigorous convergence analysis of this adaptive algorithm. The algorithm is locally convergent and the undesired stationary points are unstable. Computer simulation results are provided to compare its performance with that of two adaptive subspace estimation methods proposed by Yang and Kaveh (1988) and an improved version of one of them, for stationary and nonstationary signal scenarios. The results show that the proposed approach performs identically to one of them and is significantly superior to the remaining two.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.348123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"401","endPage":"411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.348123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8053","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8053/00348123.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive estimation","Symmetric matrices","Adaptive algorithm","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Neural networks","Cost function","Covariance matrix","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","adaptive estimation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","parallel algorithms","convergence of numerical methods","covariance matrices","parameter estimation","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigensubspace","adaptive estimation","minimum eigenvector","minimum eigenvalue","symmetric positive definite matrix","neural network","inflation technique","orthogonal eigenvectors","cost function","finite data","Newton-based adaptive algorithm","parallel structure","modular structure","computational requirement","covariance matrix","convergence analysis","adaptive algorithm","unstable stationary points","computer simulation results","adaptive subspace estimation methods","nonstationary signal","stationary signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive estimation of eigensubspace","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/348123/","volume":"43","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4909108","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive estimation of eigensubspace","sourcePdf":"00348123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027489S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"63","articleId":"348123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":348125,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The transformation is typically chosen to be the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), although other transformations, such as the cosine transform (DCT), the Hartley transform (DHT), or the Walsh-Hadamard transform, have also been proposed in the literature. The resulting algorithms are generally called DFT-LMS, DCT-LMS, etc. This preprocessing improves the eigenvalue distribution of the input autocorrelation matrix of the LMS filter and, as a consequence, ameliorates its convergence speed. In this paper, we start with a brief intuitive explanation of transform-domain algorithms. We then analyze the effects of the preprocessing performed in DFT-LMS and DCT-LMS for first-order Markov inputs. In particular, we show that for Markov-1 inputs of correlation parameter /spl rho//spl isin/[0,1], the eigenvalue spread after DFT and power normalization tends to (1+/spl rho/)l(1-/spl rho/) as the size of the filter gets large, whereas after DCT and power normalization, it reduces to (1+/spl rho/). For comparison, the eigenvalue spread before transformation is asymptotically equal to (1+/spl rho/)/sup 2//(1-/spl rho/)/sup 2/. The analytical method used in the paper provides additional insight into how the algorithms work and is expected to extend to other input signal classes and other transformations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.348125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8053/00348125.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.348125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8053","startPage":"422","endPage":"431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transform-domain adaptive filters: an analytical approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=348125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transform-domain adaptive filters: an analytical approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/348125/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4909110","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transform-domain adaptive filters: an analytical approach","sourcePdf":"00348125.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034909S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"126","articleId":"348125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":348126,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This problem has important applications in, for instance, radar direction finding and underwater source localization. The so-called deterministic and stochastic maximum likelihood (ML) methods are the main focus of this paper. A performance analysis is carried out assuming a finite number of samples and that the array is composed of a sufficiently large number of sensors. Several thousands of antennas are not uncommon in, e.g., radar applications. Strong consistency of the parameter estimates is proved, and the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimation error is derived. Unlike the previously studied large sample case, the present analysis shows that the accuracy is the same for the two ML methods. Furthermore, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimation error coincides with the deterministic Cramer-Rao bound. Under a certain assumption, the ML methods can be implemented by means of conventional beamforming for a large enough number of sensors. We also include a simple simulation study, which indicates that both ML methods provide efficient estimates for very moderate array sizes, whereas the beamforming method requires a somewhat larger array aperture to overcome the inherent bias and resolution problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8053/00348129.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.348129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.348129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8053","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=348129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of direction finding with large arrays and finite data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Sensor arrays","Parameter estimation","Radar applications","Maximum likelihood estimation","Covariance matrix","Estimation error","Array signal processing","Signal analysis","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","radar signal processing","underwater sound","covariance matrices","maximum likelihood estimation","sonar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction finding","performance analysis","large arrays","finite data","parameter estimation","sensors array","radar direction finding","underwater source localization","stochastic maximum likelihood methods","deterministic maximum likelihood methods","antennas","radar applications","asymptotic covariance matrix","estimation error","accuracy","ML methods","deterministic Cramer-Rao bound","beamforming","simulation study","array sizes","array aperture","narrowband signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/348129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of direction finding with large arrays and finite data","volume":"43","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4909114","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of direction finding with large arrays and finite data","sourcePdf":"00348129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062897S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"49","articleId":"348129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":348131,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method does not require nonlinear search, is easy to implement, and yields consistent estimates for the parameters. The resulting algorithms are theoretically tolerant to a large class of noises including additive stationary non-Gaussian noise and any Gaussian noise.

We propose a partially adaptive beamforming technique for correlated interference rejection in broadband signal environments. The beamformer output mean squared error is decomposed into an interference mean squared error term and an additional signal cancellation term that is due to the presence of correlated interference. Both mean squared errors depend on the adaptation space. The partially adaptive beamforming technique proposed here chooses an adaptation space which results in little signal cancellation while maintaining satisfactory interference cancellation. It is shown that, for a given interference scenario, a partially adaptive beamformer can be designed such that maximum interference cancellation is achieved without any signal cancellation. In practice, an approximate design procedure is provided to accommodate a set of likely interference scenarios. Analysis of the feasibility of this approach is presented. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated through examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.348132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8053","startPage":"506","endPage":"515","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8053/00348132.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partially adaptive beamforming for correlated interference rejection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/348132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Partially adaptive beamforming for correlated interference rejection","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4909117","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"43","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partially adaptive beamforming for correlated interference rejection","sourcePdf":"00348132.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048096S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","articleId":"348132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":348133,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A digital source is transmitted through a continuous channel (the propagation medium), and several measurements are performed at the receiver, either by means of several sensors, or by oversampling the received signal compared to the emission rate. Given only these observations, the baseband equivalents of the corresponding channels have to be recovered. An orthogonality property between \"signal\" and \"noise\" subspaces is exploited to build some quadratic form whose minimization yields the desired estimates up to a scale factor. This is in the same spirit as recent works by Tong et al. (see Proc. 25th Asilomar Conf., p.856-860, 1991) but requires fewer computations.

The infrastructure provides reliability as well as uninterrupted service when a PARCTAB moves from cell to cell. The PARCTAB and a supporting infrastructure has been operational since March 1993 at the Computer Science Lab at Xerox PARC. The system currently comprises thirty cells and twenty-five PARCTABs and will expand in the near future. There are three types of software components in the PARCTAB system: gateways, agents, and applications. Gateways implement a datagram service for sending and receiving packets using IR signals. Each tab is represented by an agent. An agent tracks the location of its tab and provides location independent reliable remote procedure calls. The protocols enforce security, preventing, for example, an unauthorized application from taking control of a tab.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/348175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Oct 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4817657","conferenceDate":"14-15 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"The PARCTAB mobile computing system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The PARCTAB mobile computing system","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00348175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037215S","chronDate":"14-15 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"918","citationCount":"55","articleId":"348175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":348214,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

The architecture and the learning algorithm to modify weights of the proposed neural model are elucidated. Three applications of this dynamic neural network, namely (i) functional approximation, (ii) control of unknown nonlinear dynamic systems, and (iii) coordination and control of multiple systems, are described through computer simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1993.348214","startPage":"913","endPage":"921 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Control and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/1046/8055/00348214.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Control and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.1993.348214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive tracking in nonlinear systems using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Biological system modeling","Control system synthesis","Biology computing","Computer networks","Neurons","Computer architecture","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear control systems","neural nets","adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive tracking","nonlinear systems","dynamic neural network structure","collective computation","functional approximation","unknown nonlinear dynamic systems","multiple systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/348214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive tracking in nonlinear systems using neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4818147","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive tracking in nonlinear systems using neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00348214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029784S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1993","isNumber":"8055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1046","citationCount":"2","articleId":"348214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":348268,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

First, we use a combination of a neural network and a simple algorithm, where the neural network is responsible for ranking the current states while the algorithm decides the control action (+10N or -10N) applied. Simulation results show that this method converges at a faster rate than previous researchers' schemes. In the next approach, the ability of artificial neural networks (ANN) to generate nonlinear mapping has been utilized to supplement classical control techniques, to perhaps achieve better performance. We present a hybrid controller consisting of a neural network and classical control technique. The neural network was trained to predict nonlinearities in the system. Having this prediction, a two term control law was designed where one term cancels the nonlinear effects: enabling us to use linear control theory (e.g. pole placement, optimal control, etc.) to obtain the second term. To check the applicability of our method, we tested this scheme on the bilinear model of a paper making machine as well. In these cases, our simulation studies revealed that improvements to the behavior of these systems could be achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1993.348269","startPage":"331","endPage":"336 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Control and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/1046/8055/00348269.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Control and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.1993.348269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based controllers for non-linear systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Artificial neural networks","Optimal control","Two-term control","Control theory","State feedback","Testing","Paper making machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear systems","neural nets","two-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based controllers","nonlinear systems","inverted pendulum","cart-pole system","artificial neural networks","linear control theory","pole placement","optimal control","bilinear model","paper making machine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/348269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based controllers for non-linear systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4810666","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based controllers for non-linear systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00348269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050427S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1993","isNumber":"8055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1046","citationCount":"3","articleId":"348269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":348270,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

However, in this scheme the input power factor is less than unity and varies with the rectifier operating point due to the presence of the input LC filter. Furthermore, the response to transient conditions is slow and large current oscillations may occur due to the resonance of the filter. In this paper an online neural network (NN) controller, proposed to waveshape the input line currents, forces unity power factor operation and damps the low frequency resonance of the input filter. The proposed controller is insensitive to load/parameter variations thus resulting in a robust system.

However, the output power induced in the photovoltaic modules is influenced by an intensity of solar cell radiation, temperature of the solar cells and so on. Therefore, to maximize the efficiency of the renewable energy system, it is necessary to track the maximum power point of the input source. In this paper, a new maximum power point tracker (MPPT) using fuzzy set theory is proposed to improve energy conversion efficiency. A fuzzy algorithm based on linguistic rules describing the operator's control strategy is applied to control the step-up converter for the MPPT. Fuzzy logic control based on coarse and fine mode has been incorporated in order to reduce not only the time required to track the maximum power point but also the fluctuation of power. The MPPT algorithm is implemented by a 16 bit single chip 80C196KB microcontroller. Simulation and experimental results show that performance of the fuzzy controller in a maximum power tracking of a photovoltaic array is better than that of controller based upon the hill climbing method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC'94","pdfPath":"/iel5/1115/8058/00349703.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"403 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC'94","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1994.349703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1994.349703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8058","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=349703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new maximum power point tracker of photovoltaic arrays using fuzzy controller","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Photovoltaic cells","Fuzzy control","Power generation","Temperature","Renewable energy resources","Fuzzy set theory","Energy conversion","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solar cell arrays","solar cells","fuzzy set theory","fuzzy control","power convertors","microcontrollers","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point tracker","photovoltaic arrays","fuzzy controller","output power","solar cell radiation","solar cell temperature","fuzzy set theory","energy conversion efficiency","linguistic rules","step-up converter","fine mode control","coarse mode control","power fluctuation","16 bit single chip 80C196KB microcontroller","simulation","boost converter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/349703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"A new maximum power point tracker of photovoltaic arrays using fuzzy controller","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4811191","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new maximum power point tracker of photovoltaic arrays using fuzzy controller","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00349703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033147S","chronDate":"20-25 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1115","citationCount":"52","articleId":"349703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":349711,"authors":[{"name":"A.F. de Souza","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Power Electronics Laboratory, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"A.F.","lastName":"de Souza","id":"37346669500"},{"name":"I.

Speed-related harmonics which arise from rotor slotting and eccentricity are analyzed using digital signal processing. These current harmonics exist at any nonzero speed and are independent of time-varying parameters such as stator winding resistance. A spectral estimation technique combines multiple current harmonics to determine the rotor speed with more accuracy and less sensitivity to noise than analog filtering methods or the fast Fourier transform. An on-line initialization routine determines machine-specific parameters required for slot harmonic calculations. This speed detector, which has been verified at frequencies as low as 1 Hz, can provide robust, parameter-independent information for parameter tuning or as an input to a sensorless flux observer for a field-oriented drive. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated over a wide range of inverter frequencies and load conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless speed measurement using current harmonic spectral estimation in induction machine drives","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC'94","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1994.349756","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC'94","pdfPath":"/iel5/1115/8058/00349756.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"15 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1994.349756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8058","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=349756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/349756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless speed measurement using current harmonic spectral estimation in induction machine drives","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4811138","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless speed measurement using current harmonic spectral estimation in induction machine drives","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00349756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027438S","chronDate":"20-25 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1115","citationCount":"10","articleId":"349756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":349898,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This extra information prompted us to investigate the genetic algorithms (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) methods to solve the gene ordering problem, even though they are not the best methods available to solve the TSP. Comparing the two heuristics on the gene mapping problem, we find that the GA method always converges to a good solution more quickly than the SA method. The best solution produced by the GA method is always superior to the best solution produced by the SA method. The GA method is able to do well on this problem since it is able to take advantage of the extra information mentioned above to construct good local maps that can then be used to construct good global maps.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.349920","startPage":"385","endPage":"390 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

In the GA, the chromosome consists of an array of side-chain torsion angles(/spl chi/), and the fitness is only calculated from overlap among each atom's van der Waals radius under the assumption of fixed main-chain atoms. The GA was incrementally used in the simulation. No van der Waals contact was observed in the predicted structures. This process automatically conforms most of the large side-chains in the hydrophobic core exactly the same in comparison with physical methods such as X-ray crystallography. This approach shows other solutions than the native tertiary conformation in some small side-chain positions.

To use these methods, we had to choose a fixed number of parameters and a rigid form for the learning rule. In this article, we propose to use genetic programming to find not only the values of rule parameters but also the optimal number of parameters and the form of the rule. Experiments on classification tasks suggest genetic programming finds better learning rules than other optimization methods. Furthermore, the best rule found with genetic programming outperformed the well-known backpropagation algorithm for a given set of tasks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.349932","startPage":"324","endPage":"327 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

The breeder genetic programming (BGP) method has Occam's razor in its fitness measure to evolve minimal size multilayer perceptrons. In this paper, we apply the method to synthesis of sigma-pi neural networks. Unlike perceptron architectures, sigma-pi networks use product units as well as summation units to build higher-order terms. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on benchmark problems. Simulation results on noisy data suggest that BGP not only improves the generalization performance, but it can also accelerate the convergence speed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.349933","pdfPath":"/iel2/1125/8059/00349933.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"323 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

Recently, interest in MGAs has grown because, for some problems, they are able to find solutions with fewer evaluations than genetic algorithms with larger population sizes. This paper introduces two heuristic-based MGAs which quickly find solutions to constraint satisfaction problems. Both of these algorithms outperform a well-known algorithm, the iterative descent method, on most instances of the N-queens problem. We compare these three algorithm on the basis of the mean number of evaluations needed to find solutions to several instances of the N-queens problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/349934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Jun 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4818656","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 1994","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Solving small and large scale constraint satisfaction problems using a heuristic-based microgenetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving small and large scale constraint satisfaction problems using a heuristic-based microgenetic algorithm","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00349934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065091S","chronDate":"27-29 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1125","citationCount":"38","articleId":"349934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":349938,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

A two-stage algorithm speed-up is achieved through: (1) a distributed genetic search for hidden-layer unit construction, along with the appropriate input to hidden-layer weights; and (2) a 'dynamic pocket algorithm' for learning the hidden-to-output layer weights.

GAME is target at the development and execution of complex sequential, concurrent or parallel applications, based on the genetic algorithm (GA) paradigm. Its object-oriented design and implementation provide the required levels of abstraction to describe and configure applications for a broad range of domains. GAME addresses the basic requirements involved in the design cycle of a GA application; it offers a set of genetic-oriented data structures, objects and straightforward programming interfaces that permit the implementation of a variety of GAs and parallel GAs. The underlying infrastructure provides the mechanisms for problem independent manipulation of data structures, monitoring, and execution on a virtual computing environment supporting multiple parallel computation models. Applications are constructed from parameterised libraries containing algorithms and genetic operators modules. GAME is highly customisable and its libraries can be easily expanded with the inclusion of new parameterised modules. Novice users can rapidly configure and execute pre-defined applications by simply setting up few parameters. Programmers can create new applications by combining pre-defined algorithms and genetic operators, or by directly programming new algorithms using the set of C++ classes provided. A graphic interface and monitoring facilities are also available in GAME.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.349945","startPage":"840","endPage":"845 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

We compare FIFO, EDLF, SRTF and genetic algorithms for solving this problem. The objective of the scheduling algorithm is to dynamically schedule as many tasks as possible such that each task meets its execution deadline, while minimizing the total delay time of all of the tasks. We present a MicroGA that uses a small population size of 10 chromosomes, running for 10 trials using a rather high mutation rate with a sliding window of 10 tasks. The steady-state GA was determined to be better than the generational GA for our MicroGA. We also present a parallel MicroGA model designed for parallel processors. The parallel MicroGA works best when migration is used to move tasks from one processor to another to even out the load as much a possible. Test cases show that the sequential MicroGA model and the parallel MicroGA model produced superior task schedules compared to other algorithms tested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.349947","pdfPath":"/iel2/1125/8059/00349947.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"833 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

An action network and an internal model of the environment are incorporated into the recurrent neural network, and lookahead planning is performed while configuring the action network through learning in the internal model. In addition, the lookahead planning results are used in the learning process of the action network. In other words, the two networks undergo co-evolution. A genetic algorithm is applied to the construction of the neural network and to the learning of weights. The effectiveness of this model is evaluated by applying it to the game of \"tic-tac-toe,\" and the following conclusions are obtained: (i) By performing lookahead planning using an internal model of the environment, it is possible to reduce the number of trial cycles required for learning from a real environment. (ii) The internal model should only be switched in when the learning process has progressed beyond a certain level. (iii) It is possibly more effective to perform learning in the internal model by learning algorithms than by memorizing input-output correspondences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.349959","startPage":"764","endPage":"769 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

However, unfortunately, almost all of the research in this area has so far only dealt with the collision avoidance problem in which moving obstacles are not included in the workspace of a robot manipulator. In this paper, it is shown that path planning and the collision avoidance planning problem of a robot manipulator whose workspace includes moving obstacles can be solved successfully by using a genetic algorithm. Following a brief explanation of Simple GA, the new concept of pseudo-potential is introduced in order to detect the possibility of collision with moving obstacles in the future steps. This concept is utilized in order to evaluate a fitness function of a chromosome which represents a path connecting the starting point with the goal in the workspace of a robot manipulator and construct an appropriate collision avoidance planning. A computer simulation dealing with the collision avoidance problem of two robot manipulators confirms the effectiveness of our approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.349970","startPage":"714","endPage":"719 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

Evolutionary computation and methods make it possible to design hardware that works in unknown and non-stationary environments without explicit design knowledge. In the proposed system, hardware specifications, which produce circuit behaviors, are automatically generated as HDL programs according to the grammar defined as in a rewriting system and then evolve through production genetic algorithms (PGAs), also proposed here. The PGAs introduce new chromosome representation and genetic operators to create self-genesis mechanisms in hardware design similar to living systems.

We compare one operator GAs, using only selection, and two operators GAs by selection and crossover with respect to the expected quality and speed of the convergence. First, we analyse the case of two individuals, that is the minimum population size, by a Markov chain. We show the boundary in the fitness assignment cube where crossover improves the absorption probability to the optimum. We also show that crossover always speeds up convergence. Second, we analyse the larger population case by numerically solving the difference equations. We show a boundary where the crossover speeds up convergence.

If a fuzzy system has a number of inputs, the number of membership functions and rules will be exploded. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the number of membership functions. One method to do so is to make a hierarchical structure of fuzzy inference units that have a few inputs. However the hierarchical structure cannot be made without considering the relationship among inputs. The proposed method is based on the Genetic Algorithm with a strategy that favors systems with fewer rules and membership functions, and obtains the optimal structure. The proposed method is applied to multi-dimensional function approximation problems in order to show the effectiveness.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.349991","startPage":"601","endPage":"606 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

The standard approach for optimizing these criteria has been to alternate optimizations between the variables which represent fuzzy memberships of the data to various clusters, and those prototype variables which determine the geometry of the clusters. The approach suggested here first re-parameterizes the criteria into functions of the prototype variables alone. The prototype variables are then coded as binary strings so that genetic algorithms can be applied. An overview of the approach and two simple numerical examples are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/349993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Jun 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4812339","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of fuzzy clustering criteria using genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of fuzzy clustering criteria using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00349993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047554S","chronDate":"27-29 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1125","citationCount":"40","articleId":"349993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":349995,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The non-stationary penalty is a function of the generation number; as the number of generations increases so does the penalty. Therefore, as the penalty increases it puts more and more selective pressure on the GA to find a feasible solution. The ideas presented in this paper come from two basic areas: calculus-based nonlinear programming and simulated annealing. The non-stationary penalty methods are tested on four NP test cases and the effectiveness of these methods are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

The existing way of handling such problem allows constraint violation at the expense of some penalty and meets some difficulties of choosing penalty parameter which affects directly numerical result and possible premature convergence. In order to improve this situation, a genetic algorithm for 0-1 programming with linear constraints is proposed. The basic line of this algorithm is that the constraints are to be satisfied by every trial point in the genetic algorithm. By using nonbinary code, the genetic operators are different from classical genetic algorithm. Computational results are compared with those of conventional method and possibility of parallel processing is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.349999","startPage":"559","endPage":"564 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.
