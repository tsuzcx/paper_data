For example, we know that there are definite and cannot do in this direction. For example, we know that there are definite limits to what can be accomplished by frequency selection. We know that directional selectivity is of substantial value, particularly when the pre-dominant interference comes from a direction other than that of the desired signal, and we can calculate pretty well the gain to be expected from a given design. The object of this note is to analyze another arrangement which provides for high-frequency selection plus low-frequency balancing after detection. The broad idea of balancing out the interference is old, but I know of no general analysis of the arrangement. Furthermore the principle of balance has recently acquired fresh interest due to the system disclosed by Armstrong in which high-frequency selectivity and low-frequency balancing are essential features. Armstrong's scheme is treated in more detail in the latter part of this paper. The conclusions of this study are entirely negative, that is, no appreciable gain is to be expected from balancing arrangements. This is quite in agreement with the conclusion drawn over ten years ago by John Mills as a result of a rather extended experimental study made for the Bell System.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July 1928","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1928","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1670079/","volume":"16","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1928","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Reduction of Atmospheric Disturbances","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Reduction of Atmospheric Disturbances","sourcePdf":"01670079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025878S","chronDate":"July 1928","isNumber":"34988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5547934","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1670079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1928","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1670149,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

The phenomena of high-frequency transmission lines are discussed with respect to the effect of the low attenuation per wavelength and the influence of the termination on standing waves and radiation, for both an antenna and a transmission line. The single-wire transmission line is effective when properly terminated. It is the easiest method of feeding the Hertz antenna. The adjustment may be divided into two parts. The frequency which makes the Hertz antenna a pure resistance termination must first be determined. The proper point of connection between the line and antenna must then be found to make the terminating resistance equal to the characteristic impedance of the line. When so terminated, experiment and theory show that radiation from the feeder will be small and that the feeder will act efficiently. Theoretical and experimental curves to show the nature of a horizontal Hertz antenna are shown, since they influence the behavior of the line under changing conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1670181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct. 1929","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1929","publicationDate":"Oct. 1929","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","volume":"17","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Single-Wire Transmission Lines for Short-Wave Antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Wire Transmission Lines for Short-Wave Antennas","sourcePdf":"01670181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02645S","chronDate":"Oct. 1929","isNumber":"34992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5547934","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1670181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1929","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1670211,"authors":[{"name":"F.W.

Carson's proof of the extention of Rayleigh's reciprocity theorem to a general electromagnetic system was limited to u= 1 and to sources consisting of ponderomotive forces on the electricity. A new proof is given under more general conditions, I, YJ, cr being merely restricted to be scalars and the impressed forces are of the electric type introduced by Heaviside and Abraham. These may be regarded as impressed charges and currents, including ether displacement current. The theorem is finally stated in terms of volume and surface integrals, and thus combines the viewpoints of both Lorentz and Carson. The reciprocity relations in a mechanical system are reviewed. The interconnection of electrical and mechanical systems is next considered and a \"transduction coefficient\" is defined. This concept is useful in formulating mechanical problems in electric-circuit form. An example of symmetrical transductance(copper coil in steady magnetic field) is given. The subject of units is taken up and it is proposed that in order to bring the mechanical quantities into agreement with the electrical ones when the latter are expressed in \"practical\" units, the mechanical quantities be expressed in \"mechanical-volts,\" amperes, etc., i.e., in \"practical-electric units of the mechanical quantities.\" A table for converting the principal mechanical quantities from c.g.s. to practical-electrical units is given.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1929.221771","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547934/34999/01670358.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1929.221771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reciprocity in Electromagnetic, Mechanical, Acoustical, and Interconnected Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1670358","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June 1929","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1929","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1670358/","displayDocTitle":"Reciprocity in Electromagnetic, Mechanical, Acoustical, and Interconnected Systems","volume":"17","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1929","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reciprocity in Electromagnetic, Mechanical, Acoustical, and Interconnected Systems","sourcePdf":"01670358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0221S","chronDate":"June 1929","isNumber":"34999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5547934","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1670358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1929","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1670359,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

In the first part, the fundamental mathematical expressions for the three types of modulation are derived. They are expressed in three different forms: as amplitude equations, side band equations and modulation vector equations. The amplitude equations indicate the envelope of the radio-frequency directly. The side band equations refer to the number, amplitude, and phase of the side bands produced by modulation. In the modulation vector equations, corresponding side bands are combined in pairs to form a \"modulation vector.\" This is a r-f magnitude, rotating with the angular velocity of the carrier and its amplitude is simultaneously being changed at an audio rate. The main results derived from a discussion of these equations are: In phase and frequency modulation an infinite number of side bands is produced. Amplitude modulation produces but one pair of side bands. In amplitude modulation the modulation vector, representing the first pair of side bands is in phase with the carrier. In phase and frequency modulation, it is 90 degrees out of phase with respect to the carrier. Frequency modulation is equivalent to a phase modulation in which the phase shift is inversely proportional to the audio frequency. By means of the modulation vector, a new vector diagram of the phase modulation is given. In the second part, amplitude modulation is considered in which undesired phase or frequency modulation or a combination of the two takes place simultaneously.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35019","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547934/35019/01670876.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1931.222283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1931.222283","startPage":"2145","endPage":"2176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude, Phase, and Frequency Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 1931","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1931","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1670876/","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude, Phase, and Frequency Modulation","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 1931","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude, Phase, and Frequency Modulation","sourcePdf":"01670876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032862S","chronDate":"Dec. 1931","isNumber":"35019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5547934","citationCount":"23","articleId":"1670876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1931","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1670955,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

The various forms of this method are described and reasons developed for the choice of the particular form now in common use. The apparatus in general use is described in detail. In this system three spaced antennas are connected to three separate receivers. The output of each is rectified. The d-c outputs of all three receivers are combined in a common resistor, the drop in which is used to actuate means for controlling a locally generated tone which may be transferred to the receiving operator over a wire circuit. Since fading is not simultaneous in all three of the spaced antennas, a material reduction in the effects of fading is obtained. An aperiodic form of directive receiving antenna is described. Polar diagrams showing its directivity are presented.

Assume also that in a network composed of such larger modules, no delay is encountered on the interconnections linking two gates internal to a module and a delay of one time unit is encountered on interconnections linking two gates in different modules .

We will consider a special class of state assignments called SST assignments which were first derived by Liu [1] and later extended by Tracey [2]. In these assignments all variables which must change in a given transition are allowed to change simultaneously without critical races. The best universal bound known so far has been developed by Liu and requires 2so-1 state variables, where S0 = [log2n], n being the number of states, and [x] being the least integer > x. We shall show how this bound can be substantially improved. We further show that, by generalizing the state assignment to allow multiple codings for states, the bounds can be still further improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1671300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1969","publicationDate":"June 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","volume":"C-18","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Universal Single Transition Time Asynchronous State Assignments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal Single Transition Time Asynchronous State Assignments","sourcePdf":"01671300.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043964S","chronDate":"June  1969","isNumber":"35036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1671300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1671320,"authors":[{"name":"T.D.

While the choice of which classes of transgeneration units to consider is ultimately up to the user, a number of such units are suggested herein.

This problem may be divided into two parts: find appropriate modules; and develop efficient synthesis techniques for logic networks using a minimum number of modules. In this paper a new type of universal logic modules (ULM's) called the Q-type is presented. The Q-type ULM's are superior to the existing ULM's in the sense that they require fewer input/output terminals when n\u22656 where n is the number of input variables of the ULM. Various techniques for synthesizing a logic network with a small number of ULM's are discussed. A much simpler type of modules, which is suitable to realize any symmetric or partially symmetric function and can be used as auxiliary building blocks for realizing any given logic function, is presented. A special kind of ULM's, called serially controlled ULM's which has only n+ 3 input/ output terminals, is also presented. For a ULM of this kind the signals for specifying the logic function to be realized are serially applied to one of its input terminals.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1970.222879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35043/01671472.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1970.222879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal Logic Modules and Their Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1671472/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1970","displayDocTitle":"Universal Logic Modules and Their Applications","volume":"C-19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal Logic Modules and Their Applications","sourcePdf":"01671472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0565S","chronDate":"Feb.  1970","isNumber":"35043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"51","articleId":"1671472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1671474,"authors":[{"name":"A.

On the other hand, all the methods considered apply to higher dimensional spaces and even to general metric spaces. Advantages of these methods include determinacy, easy interpretation of the resulting clusters, conformity to gestalt principles of perceptual organization, and invariance of results under monotone transformations of interpoint distance. Brief discussion is made of the application of cluster detection to taxonomy and the selection of good feature spaces for pattern recognition. Detailed analyses of several planar cluster detection problems are illustrated by text and figures.

The matrix transformation formulation is based largely on noting the use of lexicographic positional digit notation in keeping track of the few parameters describing the final N by N matrix. The algorithm includes the generation of the fast Fourier transform, fast Hadamard transform, fast Walsh transform, fast Kronecker matrix transform, and an infinite class of transformations unnamed but potentially useful in generalized spectral analysis as well as coding, bandwidth reduction, and feature selection.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1971.223202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35055/01671795.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1971.223202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35055","startPage":"133","endPage":"141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom and Modular Structure in Matrix Multiplication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1671795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom and Modular Structure in Matrix Multiplication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1671795/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1971","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-20","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1971","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom and Modular Structure in Matrix Multiplication","sourcePdf":"01671795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0278S","chronDate":"Feb.  1971","isNumber":"35055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1671795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1671798,"authors":[{"name":"H.S.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for detection of faults in one-dimensional arrays are obtained. A procedure for deriving efficient tests for one-dimensional arrays is presented. Sufficient conditions for the testability of two-dimensional arrays and procedures for constructing tests for some arrays are obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35058/01671879.pdf","startPage":"524","endPage":"535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1971.223286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1971.223286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35058","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1671879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection in Iterative Logic Arrays","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fault detection, iterative arrays, one-dimensional arrays, test derivation, two-dimensional arrays."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault detection, iterative arrays, one-dimensional arrays, test derivation, two-dimensional arrays."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1671879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1971","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection in Iterative Logic Arrays","volume":"C-20","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1971","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection in Iterative Logic Arrays","sourcePdf":"01671879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062451S","chronDate":"May  1971","isNumber":"35058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1671879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1671882,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

The study used simulated ship images in which the outline of the ship was randomly filled with black and white cells to give a low-resolution high-contrast image of the ship such as might be obtained by a high-resolution radar. The estimates were made using polynomials of invariant moments formed by transformations of the original spatial moments, e. g., density-invariant moments, central moments, rotation-invariant moments, etc. The transformations to invariant moments were chosen using physical reasoning. The best moments for the polynomials were chosen using linear regression. The performance of the method of moments on these low-resolution images was found to be comparable to that of a human photointerpreter and to certain heuristic techniques that would be more difficult to implement than the method of moments.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1971.223408","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1095","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35062/01672001.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1971.223408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Ship Photo Interpretation by the Method of Moments","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Automatic photo interpretation, comparison with human, invariant moments, linear regression, method of moments, ship images."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic photo interpretation, comparison with human, invariant moments, linear regression, method of moments, ship images."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672001/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1971","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Ship Photo Interpretation by the Method of Moments","volume":"C-20","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1971","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Ship Photo Interpretation by the Method of Moments","sourcePdf":"01672001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047625S","chronDate":"Sept.  1971","isNumber":"35062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"69","articleId":"1672001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1672003,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

Teh primary advantage of the approach is the direct but nonparametric evaluation of measurement subsets, for the M class problem.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1971.223410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35062/01672003.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1971.223410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35062","startPage":"1100","endPage":"1103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Direct Method of Nonparametric Measurement Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1672003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Direct Method of Nonparametric Measurement Selection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept. 1971","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-20","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1971","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Direct Method of Nonparametric Measurement Selection","sourcePdf":"01672003.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035892S","chronDate":"Sept. 1971","isNumber":"35062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"490","articleId":"1672003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":1672021,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

Alternatively, the multipliers could be stored in a ROM in each cell. This makes each cell bigger, and the cells are no longer identical copies of one another. We consider a third possibility in this note. In each pass the multipliers are generated from the values of the multipliers used in the previous pass.

Algorithms are presented for handling arithmetic assignment statements, DO loops and IF statement trees. The height of the parse trees of arithmetic expressions is reduced by distribution of multiplication over addition as well as the use of associativity and commutativity. DO loops are analyzed in terms of their index sets and subscript forms. Some general underlying assumptions about machine organization are also given. In terms of several measures which are defined, the results of experimental analyses are presented. About 20 Fortran IV programs consisting of nearly 1000 source cards were analyzed. Evidence is given that for very simple Fortran programs 16 processors could be effectively used operating simultaneously in a parallel or pipeline fashion. Thus, for medium or large size Fortran programs, machines consisting of multiples of a basic 16 processor unit could be used.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35066/01672094.pdf","startPage":"1293","endPage":"1310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1972.223501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1972.223501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1672094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Number of Operations Simultaneously Executable in Fortran-Like Programs and Their Resulting Speedup","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Arithmetic expression evaluation, DO loop analysis, Fortran program measurement, parallel processing, program speedup, tree height reduction."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arithmetic expression evaluation, DO loop analysis, Fortran program measurement, parallel processing, program speedup, tree height reduction."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 1972","displayDocTitle":"On the Number of Operations Simultaneously Executable in Fortran-Like Programs and Their Resulting Speedup","volume":"C-21","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1972","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Number of Operations Simultaneously Executable in Fortran-Like Programs and Their Resulting Speedup","sourcePdf":"01672094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042S","chronDate":"Dec. 1972","isNumber":"35066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"136","articleId":"1672094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1672096,"authors":[{"name":"Se June Hong","affiliation":["Systems Products Division, IBM, Corporation, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Se June Hong","id":"37613451200"},{"name":"A.M.

Cost is defined as the number of AND-OR inputs required in the two-level implementation of each memory element input equation separately ( i.e., the cost is not reduced initially by the existence of common terms between equations). An algorithm has been developed that considers implicitly all distinct state-assignment schemes for a given state table, thus ensuring that the state assignment that results in the least \"cost\" combinational network is selected.

By properly specifying a set of easily detectable topological features, it is possible to convert automatically the handwritten characters into stylized forms and to classify them into primary classes with similar topological configurations. Final recognition is accomplished by a secondary stage that performs local analysis on the characters in each primary category. The recognition system consists of two stages: global recognition, followed by local recognition. Automatic character stylization results in pattern clustering which simplifies the classification tasks considerably, while allowing a high degree of generality in the acceptable writing format. Simulation of this scheme on a digital computer has shown only 6 percent misrecognition.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1972.223581","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35068/01672174.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1972.223581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"776","endPage":"785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of Handwritten Characters by Topological Feature Extraction and Multilevel Categorization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1672174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July 1972","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of Handwritten Characters by Topological Feature Extraction and Multilevel Categorization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672174/","volume":"C-21","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1972","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of Handwritten Characters by Topological Feature Extraction and Multilevel Categorization","sourcePdf":"01672174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050441S","chronDate":"July 1972","isNumber":"35068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1672174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1672177,"authors":[{"name":"J.O.

Various gate level implementations for the majority detection circuits are also presented, although the self-checking capability of the checker does not depend on their particular implementation since they are exhaustively tested by code inputs. The self-testing checkers for k-out-of-2k codes are discussed in the most detail since the totally self-checking checkers for 1-out-of-n and arbitrary m-out-of-n codes are constructed by first translating the code to a k-out-of-2k code via a totally self-checking translator.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1973.223705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35074/01672298.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1973.223705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Totally Self-Checking Check Circuits for m-Out-of-n Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March 1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1973","displayDocTitle":"Design of Totally Self-Checking Check Circuits for m-Out-of-n Codes","volume":"C-22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1973","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Totally Self-Checking Check Circuits for m-Out-of-n Codes","sourcePdf":"01672298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021163S","chronDate":"March 1973","isNumber":"35074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"305","articleId":"1672298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1672301,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

First, within the fixed structure of a Hamming single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC/DED) code, an improvement can be obtained in circuit cost and operational speed over more conventional code implementations. Second, the mechanics of error correction in a fault-tolerant computer may be carried out via conventional hardware means or by use of the existing system facilities, such as the combination of the microprogram unit, local store, and the arithmetic-logic unit. These improvements may be obtained by the use of Rotational Coding schemes in conjunction with a technique calied \"lookaside correction.\" This paper first shows a generalized algorithm for specifying the parity check matrix of Rotational Codes. The structure implemented by the parity check matrix in this paper is not merely encoding and decoding circuitry, but translates between Rotational Code forms and byte-parity encoded forms. The unique feature of these translators is that use of the Rotational Code permits the error correction to be performed on only a subset of the data word bits, and only if a single-error condition has been detected. The correction mechanism may be either a hardware logic circuit or firmware. The paper concludes with a comparison of the circuit requirements and correctional speed of the Hamming (72, 64) single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting code, as it normally would be implemented, and a Rotational Code translator also operating on 64 data bits and 8 check bits.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1973.223708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35074/01672301.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1973.223708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lookaside Techniques for Minimum Circuit Memory Translators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March 1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1973","displayDocTitle":"Lookaside Techniques for Minimum Circuit Memory Translators","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","volume":"C-22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1973","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lookaside Techniques for Minimum Circuit Memory Translators","sourcePdf":"01672301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089504S","chronDate":"March 1973","isNumber":"35074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1672301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1672304,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The circuits used to achieve these functions can be considered to form an independent functional block, called a data manipulator. A basic organization applicable to both sequential and parallel processors is then suggested. The main deviation of a parallel processor orgaization from the conventional Von Neumann organization is seen to be in the bit-slice (bis) manipulating functions. A comprehensive set of bis manipulating functions from the categories of permuting, replicating, spacing and masking is given. Implementation of the last category, the masking functions, is usually through a mask register by defining its content (mask pattern). It is found that for many operations the required mask patterns are periodic and/or monotonic. The upper bounds of generating these patterns are found. The techniques and designs of two data manipulators for the first three categories of DMF's (permuting, replicating, spacing) are given. Periodic and monotonic mask patterns are also used to help in implementing some of these functions.

First we make what we call structural forecasts, and then we calculate the absolute dollar-volume forecasts. Structural forecasts describe the technology and function of a software project, but not its size. We allocate resources (costs) over the project's life cycle from the structural forecasts. Judgment, technical knowledge, and econometric research should combine in making the structural forecasts. A methodology based on a 25 X 7 structural forecast matrix that has been used by TRW with good results over the past few years is presented in this paper. With the structural forecast in hand, we go on to calculate the absolute dollar-volume forecasts. The general logic followed in \"absolute\" cost estimating can be based on either a mental process or an explicit algorithm. A cost estimating algorithm is presented and five tradition methods of software cost forecasting are described: top-down estimating, similarities and differences estimating, ratio estimating, standards estimating, and bottom-up estimating. All forecasting methods suffer from the need for a valid cost data base for many estimating situations. Software information elements that experience has shown to be useful in establishing such a data base are given in the body of the paper. Major pricing pitfalls are identified. Two case studies are presented that illustrate the software cost forecasting methodology and historical results. Topics for further work and study are suggested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June 1974","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"C-23","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1974","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"The Cost of Developing Large-Scale Software","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Cost of Developing Large-Scale Software","sourcePdf":"01672595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026712S","chronDate":"June 1974","isNumber":"35085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"119","articleId":"1672595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1672606,"authors":[{"name":"G.K.

One application of these circuits is in the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) of a computer with data encoded in an error-detecting code. While there is no code simpler than duplication which detects single errors in logical operations such as AND and OR, it is shown that there exist partially self-checking networks to perform these operations.

A method is presented for labeling the lines of a network. Procedures are described for obtaining a minimal labeling, i.e., one corresponding to a minimal set of tests, for fanout-free circuits and for a restricted class of circuits with fanout. Using these procedures, a branch-and-bound algorithm is developed for selecting an optimal (or near-optimal) set of q test points in fanout-free networks. Some difficulties associated with test point placement in general networks are pointed out. It is shown that the labeling approach is also applicable to the problem of selecting and placing control logic.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Control logic, fault detection, improving diagnosability, placement algorithms, test points."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control logic, fault detection, improving diagnosability, placement algorithms, test points."]}],"doi":"10.1109/T-C.1974.224021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35086/01672614.pdf","startPage":"727","endPage":"735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1974.224021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test Point Placement to Simplify Fault Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1672614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Test Point Placement to Simplify Fault Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672614/","volume":"C-23","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1974","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July 1974","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test Point Placement to Simplify Fault Detection","sourcePdf":"01672614.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034435S","chronDate":"July 1974","isNumber":"35086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"70","articleId":"1672614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1672628,"authors":[{"name":"C.V.

First, the notion of a logical algorithm is introduced as a finite state automaton described by transition and output matrix. The technical realizations of such algorithms is then uniformly described as time-discrete, space-discrete, and time-space-discrete systems, and the transition of an algorithm from state-to-state (or space node-to-space node) can be explicitly formulated in a very concise way. An application of this formalism to the state reduction problem is shown. Thus the paper extends the APL-based design of logical networks beyond the area of combinational networks as developed first by Iverson.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1974.224053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35088/01672646.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1974.224053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35088","startPage":"897","endPage":"906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Formalism for Description and Synthesis of Logical Algorithms and their Hardware Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1672646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Formalism for Description and Synthesis of Logical Algorithms and their Hardware Implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept. 1974","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-23","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1974","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Formalism for Description and Synthesis of Logical Algorithms and their Hardware Implementation","sourcePdf":"01672646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045973S","chronDate":"Sept. 1974","isNumber":"35088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","articleId":"1672646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1672647,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Memory access requirements for an array processor are discussed in general terms and a set of common requirements are defined. The ability to meet these requirements is shown to depend on the number of independent memory units and on the mapping of the data in these memories. Next, the need to align these data for processing is demonstrated and various alignment requirements are defined. Hardware which can perform this alignment function is discussed, e.g., permutation, indexing, switching or sorting networks, and a network (the omega network) based on Stone's shuffle-exchange operation [1] is presented. Construction of this network is described and many of its useful properties are proven. Finally, as an example of these ideas, an array processor is shown which allows conflict-free access and alignment of rows, columns, diagonals, backward diagonals, and square blocks in row or column major order, as well as certain other special operations.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1975.224157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35092/01672750.pdf","startPage":"1145","endPage":"1155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1975.224157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Access and Alignment of Data in an Array Processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 1975","displayDocTitle":"Access and Alignment of Data in an Array Processor","volume":"C-24","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672750/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Access and Alignment of Data in an Array Processor","sourcePdf":"01672750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081241S","chronDate":"Dec. 1975","isNumber":"35092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"795","articleId":"1672750","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1672762,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

Variations of single-transition time (STT) state assignments are shown to be applicable to the problem of assigning memory addresses to a memory representation of an asynchronous network. Design algorithms are developed which allow the implementation of an asynchronous sequential network as a READ-ONLY memory. Two operating modes are considered: normal asynchronous operation and a self-clocked mode in which sequential outputs are allowed on a single-input change, thus providing a means of implementing functions normally achieved with synchronous (clocked) networks. In addition the practical timing constraints of the proposed methods are considered.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35093/01672778.pdf","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1975.224185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1975.224185","startPage":"195","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Asynchronous Sequential Networks Using Read-Only Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb. 1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672778/","displayDocTitle":"Design of Asynchronous Sequential Networks Using Read-Only Memories","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-24","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 1975","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Asynchronous Sequential Networks Using Read-Only Memories","sourcePdf":"01672778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026203S","chronDate":"Feb. 1975","isNumber":"35093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1672778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1672780,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

The capability of the structure is demonstrated in examples of LIM data transfer and sorting arrays.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1975.224206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35094/01672799.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1975.224206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Level Emitter-Function Logic Structures for Logic-in-Memory Computers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1672799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March 1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672799/","displayDocTitle":"Two-Level Emitter-Function Logic Structures for Logic-in-Memory Computers","volume":"C-24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1975","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Level Emitter-Function Logic Structures for Logic-in-Memory Computers","sourcePdf":"01672799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061131S","chronDate":"March 1975","isNumber":"35094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1672799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1672801,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

This paper provides a solution to the above problem. It is known that a test set derived for the detection of some fault may fail this purpose in the presence of an additional fault. This phenomenon is called masking among faults, and is of great importance in the derivation of a test set which detects all multiple-faults. This paper investigates the masking relations among faults in a combinational logic circuit. For this purpose a transform for the circuit is defined and a model for fault analysis is constructed. This transform and model reduce the number of faults which have to be considered in order to achieve the detection of all multiple-faults. An algebraic procedure yields the derivation of the masking relations. A problem which arises, namely the existence of a set of faults forming a loop of masking relations is considered. An application is presented: starting with a test set derived under the single-fault assumption it is shown how to extend this test set so that it detects all multiple-faults. All of the results in this paper are valid for general multiple-output circuits. For simplicity in the exposition, the single-output case is examined.","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1975.224249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35096/01672842.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1975.224249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35096","startPage":"476","endPage":"482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Masking in Combinational Logic Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1672842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fault Masking in Combinational Logic Circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672842/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1975","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1975","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Masking in Combinational Logic Circuits","sourcePdf":"01672842.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032923S","chronDate":"May 1975","isNumber":"35096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","articleId":"1672842","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1672843,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The hardware advances allow practical implementation of more sophisticated and complex systems which have fewer components, but which may present severe test and maintenance problems due to their complexity. As a result, the use of built-in test (BIT) hardware in place of software becomes increasingly attractive. The Navy funded Advanced Avionics Fault Isolation System (AAFIS) concept utilizes BIT logic for cost-effective fault detection and fault isolation to a digital subsystem and to the faulty module therein. Added logic, available at low cost with advanced microelectronics, is used to perform test pattern generation in each subsystem and to code over the test sequence the outputs and test points on each subsystem module. The coded test response is compared to a predetermined constant. The OR of resulting module pass-fail signals indicates subsystem faults, while identification of a module fail signal provides isolation to a faulty module. Practical coding techniques are presented, with tradeoff of speed, test effectiveness and logic requirements for each. BIT logic design and simulation results verify high fault detection and moderate added logic for BIT.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Advanced Fault Isolation System for Digital Logic","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/T-C.1975.224251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35096/01672844.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1975.224251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35096","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1672844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1975","displayDocTitle":"An Advanced Fault Isolation System for Digital Logic","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-24","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","publicationDate":"May 1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Advanced Fault Isolation System for Digital Logic","sourcePdf":"01672844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042091S","chronDate":"May 1975","isNumber":"35096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"57","articleId":"1672844","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1672847,"authors":[{"name":"M.Y.

It has long been known that this model is pessimistic since there are instances, termed compensating module failures, where a majority of the modules fail but the network is nonfailed. A different module reliability model based on lead reliability is proposed which has the classical NMR reliability model as a special case. Recent results from the area of test generation are employed to simplify the module reliability calculation under the lead reliability model. First a fault equivalent technique, based on functional equivalence of faults, is developed to determine the effect of compensating module failures on system reliability. This technique can increase the predicted mission time (the time the system is to operate at or above a given reliability) by at least 40 percent over the classical model prediction for simple networks. Since the fault equivalent technique is too complex for modeling of large circuits a second, computational simpler technique, based on fault dominance, is derived. It is then shown to yield results comparable to the fault equivalent technique. A more complex example circuit analyzed by the fault dominance model shows at least a 75 percent improvement in mission time due to modeling compensating module failures. A commercialy available 31 gate integrated circuit chip is also modeled to demonstrate the applicability of the technique to large circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1672849/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1975","volume":"C-24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1975","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Modeling of Compensating Module Failures in Majority Voted Redundancy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Modeling of Compensating Module Failures in Majority Voted Redundancy","sourcePdf":"01672849.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034961S","chronDate":"May 1975","isNumber":"35096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","articleId":"1672849","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1672855,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

Previous studies using the continuous-time analysis only models a portion of the CPCH process. We assume that a packet arrival process is Poisson distributed and the service time of each packet is geometrically distributed. The study focuses on examining the number of packet arrivals in each CPCH access slot.

Therefore, receiver algorithms for cancellation of cochannel interference have recently attracted much interest. At the mobile terminal, algorithms can usually rely only on one received signal delivered by a single receive antenna. In this letter, a low-complexity single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) algorithm for real-valued modulation formats referred to as mono interference cancellation (MIC) is introduced which is well suited for practical applications.

The computational complexity of finite impulse response (FIR) filters used in the IF processing block is dominated by the number of adders (subtracters) employed in the multipliers. This paper presents a method to implement FIR filters for SDR receivers using minimum number of adders. We use an arithmetic scheme, known as pseudo floating-point (PFP) representation to encode the filter coefficients. By employing a span reduction technique, we show that the filter coefficients can be coded using considerably fewer bits than conventional 24-bit and 16-bit fixed-point filters. Simulation results show that the magnitude responses of the filters coded in PFP meet the attenuation requirements of wireless communication standard specifications.

Local decisions made by local sensors, possibly in the presence of faults, are transmitted to a fusion center through fading channels. Classification performance could be degraded due to the errors caused by both sensor faults and fading channels. Integrating channel decoding into the distributed fault-tolerant classification fusion algorithm, we obtain a new fusion rule that combines both soft-decision decoding and local decision rules without introducing any redundancy. The soft decoding scheme is utilized to combat channel fading, while the distributed classification fusion structure using error correcting codes provides good sensor fault-tolerance capability. Asymptotic performance of the proposed approach is also investigated. Performance evaluation of the proposed approach with both sensor faults and fading channel impairments is carried out.

A space-time modulation technique that can be seen as two-dimensional spreading is introduced. It provides full transmit diversity for every user, and accommodates N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n times the number of users as a single-antenna code-division multi-access (CDMA) scheme, where N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n is the number of transmit antennas. Thus multiple access is provided through spatial as well as code dimensions. In addition, the scheme forms groups of users that are orthogonal to each other. This feature translates into simplified detection strategies without loss of performance. The main detector structure of interest is a two-stage interference canceller because of its low complexity compared to other joint detectors. We will demonstrate that in conjunction with an unequal power allocation scheme, this receiver provides full diversity and suffers from only a small performance loss compared to the full-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) receiver. In a single-user multiple antenna system, the same spreading scheme and unequal power allocation yields a new approach to designing full-rate, full-diversity space-time codes having good performance with successive interference cancellers","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1673084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/35109/01673084.pdf","startPage":"1726","endPage":"1734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1673084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time multiplexing for mimo multiuser downlink channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673084/","displayDocTitle":"Space-time multiplexing for mimo multiuser downlink channels","volume":"5","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9067234","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1673084/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time multiplexing for mimo multiuser downlink channels","sourcePdf":"01673084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077312S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"35109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"35109","articleId":"1673084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1673086,"authors":[{"name":"Taewon Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/35109/1673086/1673086-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taewon Hwang received the B.S. degree in Electronics Engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea in 1993, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1995 and 2005, respectively.

A new general method to build a factor graph which takes into account both the code constraints and the channel behavior is proposed and the a posteriori probabilities of the information symbols, necessary to implement maximum a posteriori (MAP) symbol detection, are derived by using the sum-product algorithm. With respect to the case of a LDPC code transmitted on a memoryless channel, the derived factor graphs have additional factor nodes taking into account the channel behavior and not the code constraints. It is shown that the function associated to the generic factor node modeling the channel is related to the basic branch metric used in the Viterbi algorithm when MAP sequence detection is applied or in the BCJR algorithm implementing MAP symbol detection. This fact suggests that all the previously proposed solutions for those algorithms can be systematically extended to LDPC codes and graph-based detection. When the sum-product algorithm works on the derived factor graphs, the most demanding computation is in general that performed at factor nodes modeling the channel. In fact, the complexity of the computation at these factor nodes is in general exponential in a suitably defined channel memory parameter. In these cases, a technique for complexity reduction is illustrated. In some particular cases of practical relevance, the above mentioned complexity becomes linear in the channel memory. This does not happen in the same cases when detection is performed by using the Viterbi algorithm or the BCJR algorithm, suggesting that the use of factor graphs and the sum-product algorithm might be computationally more appealing. As an example of application of the described framework, the cases of noncoherent and flat fading channels are considered","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1673087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/35109/01673087.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1673087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35109","startPage":"1757","endPage":"1766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On LDPC codes over channels with memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On LDPC codes over channels with memory","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9067237","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1673087/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On LDPC codes over channels with memory","sourcePdf":"01673087.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119665S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"35109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"35109","articleId":"1673087","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1673088,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-P.E.

Thus in this paper, we will propose an adaptive algorithm that account for CSI imperfections and practical operating conditions explicitly, namely imperfect channel estimation at receiver, delayed quantized feedback to transmitter and a spatially correlated continuous fading channel. A metric for the SINR of each eigenmode under the above practical conditions is identified and this metric is used in the adaptive signaling to ensure a robust adaptive algorithm.

For noncoherent DF, the approximation suggests a different optimal location for the relay in DF than for the relay in amplify-and-forward (AF). A set of tight bounds of diversity order for coherent and noncoherent DF with multiple relays is also provided, and comparison between DF and AF suggests that DF with more than one relay loses about half of the diversity order of AF","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/35109/01673090.pdf","startPage":"1785","endPage":"1794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1673090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1673090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation and demodulation for cooperative diversity in wireless systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Relays","Diversity reception","Detectors","Piecewise linear techniques","Maximum likelihood detection","Wireless communication","Maximum likelihood decoding","Error probability","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","diversity reception","error statistics","maximum likelihood estimation","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative diversity","wireless systems","maximum likelihood demodulation","cooperative wireless communication systems","piecewise-linear combining","decode-and-forward","BER","amplify-and-forward"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Modulation and demodulation for cooperative diversity in wireless systems","volume":"5","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1673090/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9067240","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation and demodulation for cooperative diversity in wireless systems","sourcePdf":"01673090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047874S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"35109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"350","xplore-issue":"35109","articleId":"1673090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1673091,"authors":[{"name":"F.

SMC methods are traditionally built on the techniques of sequential importance sampling (SIS) and resampling. In this paper, we apply the SMC methodology to the problem of symbol detection in a differentially encoded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system over a frequency selective fading channel. We first propose the periodical termination of differential phase trellis at predetermined indices. It is seen that accelerated weight degeneracy and impoverished trajectory diversity - problems that are encountered in traditional SMC methods - are mitigated. Using these observations, a novel SMC framework that circumvents resampling is then developed. The effect of varying termination periods on the performance of the non-resampling detector is investigated. We also present results which show that periodic termination helps to retard weight degeneracy. The performance of traditional and non-resampling SMC detectors for a convolutional-coded OFDM system is compared and simulation results suggest that the non-resampling detector performs better than its traditional counterpart. We also consider a low-density parity check (LDPC)-coded OFDM system and simulation results suggest the near bound performance of the proposed non-resampling SMC detector","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1673096","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/35109/01673096.pdf","startPage":"1846","endPage":"1856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1673096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A non-resampling sequential monte carlo detector for coded OFDM systems based on periodic termination of differential phase trellis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673096/","displayDocTitle":"A non-resampling sequential monte carlo detector for coded OFDM systems based on periodic termination of differential phase trellis","volume":"5","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9067246","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1673096/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A non-resampling sequential monte carlo detector for coded OFDM systems based on periodic termination of differential phase trellis","sourcePdf":"01673096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057836S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"35109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"35109","articleId":"1673096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1673097,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.D.

Considering a mobile wireless communications system with two transmit antennas, we form a 4D signal constellation as Cartesian product of two 2D rectangular signal sets, a 4D point being transmitted by the first antenna as two concatenated 2D points in two consecutive channel uses. The 2D symbols transmitted by the second antenna are not independent, but so chosen as to form, together with the symbols transmitted by the first antenna, the entries of a 2 times 2 orthogonal matrix. This can be done in four different ways, resulting in four sets of 2 times 2 orthogonal matrices. To obtain a higher data rate, the union of two of them forms a super-orthogonal signal set. With 2 times 2 orthogonal matrices, we then label the state transitions of a trellis diagram describing the operation of the encoder. We perform simulations using a model that takes into account the Doppler effect as well as the effect of spatial antenna correlation at both the base station (BS) and at the mobile station (MS). The frame error rate (FER) and the bit error rate (BER) performance results show an excellent behaviour of our proposed super-orthogonal ST trellis code, which clearly outperforms all known simple ST trellis codes of same spectral efficiency using 16QAM or 16PSK","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super-orthogonal space-time codes with rectangular constellations and two transmit antennas for high data rate wireless communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1673097","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/35109/01673097.pdf","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1673097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673097/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"Super-orthogonal space-time codes with rectangular constellations and two transmit antennas for high data rate wireless communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1673097/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9067247","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-orthogonal space-time codes with rectangular constellations and two transmit antennas for high data rate wireless communications","sourcePdf":"01673097.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071807S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"35109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"35109","articleId":"1673097","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1673099,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/35109/1673099/1673099-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hong-Chuan Yang (S'00, M'03) was born inL iaoning, China.

The motivation behind this work is that each user adopting a signaling scheme better matched to his own channel condition proves to improve the individual link performance but the resultant co-channel interference mitigation problem is scarcely addressed thus far. By exploiting the algebraic structure of orthogonal code, it is shown that the V-BLAST detector in the considered dual-signaling environment allows for an attractive group-wise implementation: at each iteration a group of symbols, transmitted either from an OSTBC station or from an antenna of an SM terminal, are jointly detected. The group detection property, resulting uniquely from the use of orthogonal codes, potentially improves the dual-mode signal separation efficiency, especially when the OSTBC terminals are dense in the cell. The embedded structure of the channel matrix is also exploited for deriving a computationally efficient detector implementation. Flop count evaluations and numerical examples are used for illustrating the performance of the proposed V-BLAST based solution","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1673101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/35109/01673101.pdf","startPage":"1896","endPage":"1909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1673101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group-wise V-BLAST detection in multiuser space-time dual-signaling wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673101/","displayDocTitle":"Group-wise V-BLAST detection in multiuser space-time dual-signaling wireless systems","volume":"5","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9067251","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1673101/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group-wise V-BLAST detection in multiuser space-time dual-signaling wireless systems","sourcePdf":"01673101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081433S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"35109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"35109","articleId":"1673101","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1673103,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/35109/1673103/1673103-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yunfei Chen (SM'02-M'06) received his B.E. and M.

The effect of estimation errors on the performance of the combiner is evaluated and illustrated by numerical examples.

Routing is based on a link cost factor, which is defined using the quality of service (QoS) metric selected as a ratio of the remaining energy of the nodes and end-to-end delay times the distance from the base station (BS). Initially in OEDSR, the nodes are either in idle or sleep mode, but once an event is detected, the nodes near the event become active and start forming sub-networks. Formation of the inactive network into a sub-network saves energy because only a portion of the network is active in response to an event. Subsequently, the sub-networks organize themselves into clusters with cluster heads (CHs). The data from the CHs are sent to the BS via relay nodes that are located outside the sub-networks in a multi-hop manner by using the proposed routing protocol. This routing protocol improves the lifetime of the network and the scalability. GloMoSim results indicate that the OEDSR protocol results in lower average end-to-end delay, fewer collisions and less energy consumed when compared with DSR, AODV, and Bellman Ford routing protocols","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/11076/35110/01673167.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"335","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2006.1673167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSC.2006.1673167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35110","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OEDSR: Optimized Energy-Delay Sub-network Routing in Wireless Sensor Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Routing protocols","Quality of service","Delay","Wireless application protocol","Costs","Base stations","Event detection","Relays","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","routing protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OEDSR","optimized energy-delay sub-network routing protocol","wireless sensor network","link cost factor","quality of service metric","end-to-end delay","base station","sleep mode","inactive network","cluster heads","relay nodes","GloMoSim","AODV routing protocol","Bellman Ford routing protocol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"OEDSR: Optimized Energy-Delay Sub-network Routing in Wireless Sensor Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1673167/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9075789","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OEDSR: Optimized Energy-Delay Sub-network Routing in Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Ft.

Motivated by the real-time solution to the robotic problems, dynamic system solvers in the form of recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been developed and employed.

A possible approach to solve this issue is through intelligent use of the nodes' past experiences of the network traffic conditions and making predictions on the future network traffic conditions based on the experiences. Delay is a typical routing metric. In this paper, we present a scheme for predicting mean per-packet one-hop delays using neural network approaches. The predicted one-hop delays are then used by the nodes to participate in routing information diffusion. By experiments, we prove the feasibility of predicting mean delays as a time series using either tapped-delay-line Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network or tapped-delay-line Radial Basis Function (RBF) network. Two types of inputs for prediction are used: a) the mean delay time series itself only, b) the mean delay time series together with the corresponding traffic loads. The advantages and limitations of these neural network approaches are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2006.1673218","startPage":"625","endPage":"630","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/11076/35110/01673218.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSC.2006.1673218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Prediction for Intelligent Routing in Wireless Networks Using Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Wireless networks","Neural networks","Routing protocols","Telecommunication traffic","Delay effects","Network topology","NASA","Communication system control","Multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","radial basis function networks","radio networks","routing protocols","telecommunication computing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay prediction","intelligent routing","wireless networks","neural networks","wireless routing protocols","routing information diffusion","network traffic conditions","mean per-packet one-hop delays","tapped-delay-line multilayer perceptron network","MLP network","tapped-delay-line radial basis function network","RBF network","mean delay time series"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Delay Prediction for Intelligent Routing in Wireless Networks Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1673218/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2006","accessionNumber":"9085955","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Prediction for Intelligent Routing in Wireless Networks Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Ft.

Most of the past works have emphasized feature extraction and classification using classical methods for these works. The main goal in feature extraction is presented data in lower dimension. One of the popular methods in feature extraction is principle component analysis (PCA). This method and similar methods rely mostly on powerful classification algorithms to deal with redundant and irrelevant features. In this paper we introduced particle swarm optimization (PSO) as a simple, general, and powerful framework for selecting good subsets of features, leading to improved detection rates. We used PCA for feature extraction and support vector machines (SVMs) for classification. The goal is to search the PCA space using PSO to select a subset of eigenvectors encoding important information about the target concept of interest. Another object in this paper is to increase speed of convergence by using PSO to find the best feature. We have tested the framework in mind on challenging application like face detection.

An IP flow is a unidirectional series of IP packets of a given protocol, traveling between a source and destination, within a certain period of time. Based on \"flow\" concept, we developed a flow-based aggregation technique that dramatically reduces the amount of monitoring data and handles high amounts of statistics and packet data. FSSAS sets up flow-based statistical feature vectors and reports to a neural network classifier. The neural classifier uses back-propagation networks to classify the score metric of each flow. FSAS can detect both bandwidth type DOS and protocol type DOS. Moreover, flow here could be any set of packets sharing certain common property as \"flow key\". FSAS configures flow flexibly to provide security from network level to application level (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP...), and different aggregation schemes, such as server-based, client-based flow. This novel IDS has been evaluated by using DARPA 98 data and CONEX test-bed data. Results show the success in terms of different aggregation schemes for both datasets","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/11076/35110/01673246.pdf","startPage":"786","endPage":"791","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2006.1673246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSC.2006.1673246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35110","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flow-based Statistical Aggregation Schemes for Network Anomaly Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Intrusion detection","Neural networks","Internet","Traffic control","Protocols","Monitoring","Statistics","Data security","Fluid flow measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","IP networks","neural nets","security of data","statistical analysis","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow-based statistical aggregation schemes","network anomaly detection","IP flow","unidirectional series","IP packets","monitoring data","packet data","flow-based statistical feature vectors","neural network classifier","back-propagation networks","score metric","bandwidth type DOS","protocol type DOS","flow key","IP","TCP","UDP","HTTP","FTP","server-based flow","client-based flow","IDS","DARPA 98 data","CONEX test-bed data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flow","Aggregation","Neural Network Classifier","Network Intrusion Detection System"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Flow-based Statistical Aggregation Schemes for Network Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1673246/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9085978","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flow-based Statistical Aggregation Schemes for Network Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Ft.

In the presence of colored interference and noise with known statistical properties, waveform optimization for active sensors such as radar can significantly increase the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio needed for much improved target detection. However, the so-obtained optimal waveforms can result in significant modulus variation, poor range resolution, and/or high peak sidelobe levels. To mitigate these problems, we can constrain the waveform optimization problem by restricting the sought-after waveform to be similar to a desired waveform, which is known to have, for example, constant modulus as well as reasonable range resolution and peak sidelobe level. One example of the desired waveform is the widely used linear frequency modulated waveform or chirp.

In our approach, the Gabor wavelets are used to extract facial features, then a doubly nonlinear mapping kernel PCA (DKPCA) is proposed to perform feature transformation and face recognition. The conventional kernel PCA nonlinearly maps an input image into a high-dimensional feature space in order to make the mapped features linearly separable. However, this method does not consider the structural characteristics of the face images, and it is difficult to determine which nonlinear mapping is more effective for face recognition. In this paper, a new method of nonlinear mapping, which is performed in the original feature space, is defined. The proposed nonlinear mapping not only considers the statistical property of the input features, but also adopts an eigenmask to emphasize those important facial feature points. Therefore, after this mapping, the transformed features have a higher discriminating power, and the relative importance of the features adapts to the spatial importance of the face images. This new nonlinear mapping is combined with the conventional kernel PCA to be called \"doubly\" nonlinear mapping kernel PCA. The proposed algorithm is evaluated based on the Yale database, the AR database, the ORL database and the YaleB database by using different face recognition methods such as PCA, Gabor wavelets plus PCA, and Gabor wavelets plus kernel PCA with fractional power polynomial models.

This paper presents a new algorithm in such a paradigm, based on the adaptive decision of appropriate downsampling directions/ratios and quantization steps, in order to achieve higher coding quality with low bit rates with the consideration of local visual significance. The full-resolution image can be restored from the DCT coefficients of the downsampled pixels so that the spatial interpolation required otherwise is avoided. The proposed algorithm significantly raises the critical bit rate to approximately 1.2 bpp, from 0.15-0.41 bpp in the existing downsample-prior-to-JPEG schemes and, therefore, outperforms the standard JPEG method in a much wider bit-rate scope. The experiments have demonstrated better PSNR improvement over the existing techniques before the critical bit rate. In addition, the adaptive mode decision not only makes the critical bit rate less image-independent, but also automates the switching coders in variable bit-rate applications, since the algorithm turns to the standard JPEG method whenever it is necessary at higher bit rates","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive downsampling to improve image compression at low bit rates","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.877415","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/35118/01673434.pdf","startPage":"2513","endPage":"2521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.877415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35118","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673434/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive downsampling to improve image compression at low bit rates","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1673434/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9052295","pubMedId":"16948298","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive downsampling to improve image compression at low bit rates","sourcePdf":"01673434.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141463S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"35118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"35118","articleId":"1673434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1673442,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Lyul Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/35118/1673442/1673442-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yung-Lyul Lee received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1985 and 1987, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Taejon, Korea, in 1999.","He has been an Associate Professor with the School of Computer engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, since 2001.

We develop, analyze, and apply a new finite mixture model based on a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution. The generalized Dirichlet distribution has a more general covariance structure than the Dirichlet distribution and offers high flexibility and ease of use for the approximation of both symmetric and asymmetric distributions. We show that the mathematical properties of this distribution allow high-dimensional modeling without requiring dimensionality reduction and, thus, without a loss of information. This makes the generalized Dirichlet distribution more practical and useful. We propose a hybrid stochastic expectation maximization algorithm (HSEM) to estimate the parameters of the generalized Dirichlet mixture. The algorithm is called stochastic because it contains a step in which the data elements are assigned randomly to components in order to avoid convergence to a saddle point. The adjective \"hybrid\" is justified by the introduction of a Newton-Raphson step. Moreover, the HSEM algorithm autonomously selects the number of components by the introduction of an agglomerative term.

In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive despeckling filter and derive a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for the radar cross section (RCS). We first employ a logarithmic transformation to change the multiplicative speckle into additive noise. We model the RCS using the recently introduced heavy-tailed Rayleigh density function, which was derived based on the assumption that the real and imaginary parts of the received complex signal are best described using the alpha-stable family of distribution. We estimate model parameters from noisy observations by means of second-kind statistics theory, which relies on the Mellin transform. Finally, we compare the proposed algorithm with several classical speckle filters applied on actual SAR images. Experimental results show that the homomorphic MAP filter based on the heavy-tailed Rayleigh prior for the RCS is among the best for speckle removal","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.877362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/35118/01673449.pdf","startPage":"2686","endPage":"2693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.877362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR image filtering based on the heavy-tailed Rayleigh model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673449/","displayDocTitle":"SAR image filtering based on the heavy-tailed Rayleigh model","volume":"15","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9052308","pubMedId":"16948313","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1673449/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR image filtering based on the heavy-tailed Rayleigh model","sourcePdf":"01673449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083516S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"35118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"35118","articleId":"1673449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1673450,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Recently, the research of image denoising has been focused on the wavelet domain. Compared to the classical nonlinear filters, it is based on a global multiscale analysis of images. Apparently, the wavelet transform can be embedded in a moving window. Thus, a moving window-based local multiscale analysis is obtained. In this paper, based on the Haar wavelet, a class of nonorthogonal multichannel filter bank with its corresponding wavelet shrinkage called Lee shrinkage is derived.

The same motivations also drive the design of multispectral filter arrays (MSFA), in which more than three spectral bands are used. Although considerable research has been reported to optimally reconstruct the full-color image using various demosaicking algorithms, studies on the intrinsic properties of these filter arrays as well as the underlying design principles have been very limited. Given a set of representative spectral bands, the design of an MSFA involves two issues: the selection of tessellation mechanisms and the arrangement/layout of different spectral bands. We develop a generic MSFA generation method starting from a checkerboard pattern. We show, through case studies, that most of the CFAs currently used by the industry can be derived as special cases of MSFAs generated using the generic algorithm. The performance of different MSFAs are evaluated based on their intrinsic properties, namely, the spatial uniformity and the spectral consistency.

The exposure system is placed within an anechoic chamber and incorporates continuous online monitoring of basal and stimulated catecholamine release from cultured bovine adrenal-medullary chromaffin cells, which are well-established models of neural-type cells. The cells are immobilized inside a cell-perfusion apparatus (CPA) and are continuously superfused with temperature-controlled balanced salt solution, with the entire CPA placed within a mini exposure chamber (MEC) constructed out of a MW-absorbing material. All relevant equipment for carrying out the experiments is shielded from the MW field by being housed in an aluminum conductor box located behind the MEC. Detailed distributions of the electric field and the specific absorption rate (SAR) at the location of the cells within the MEC were computed using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. FDTD computations were also used for optimizing the exposure system, so that the highest intensity of electric field could be delivered under dynamic temperature control and with an acceptable degree of field homogeneity (to within 30%) over the entire frequency range of 1-6 GHz.

Depending on the open-loop stability assumption, the global stability analysis and stabilization problems are considered. In the (local) analysis problem, the objective is the determination of estimates of the basin of attraction of the system. Considering the stabilization problem, the goal is to design a set of gains in order to enlarge the basin of attraction of the closed-loop system. Based on the modelling of the system presenting nested saturations as a linear system with dead-zone nested nonlinearities and the use of a generalized sector condition, linear matrix inequality (LMI) stability conditions are formulated.

The signal of interest is modeled as originating from a patch of cortex and is represented using a set of basis functions. Each cortical patch has its own set of bases, which allows representation of arbitrary source activity within the patch. This is in contrast to previously proposed cortical patch models which assume a specific distribution of activity within the patch. We present a procedure for designing bases that minimize the normalized mean squared representation error, averaged over different activity distributions within the patch. Extension of existing algorithms to the basis function framework is straightforward and is illustrated using linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) spatial filtering and maximum-likelihood signal estimation/generalized likelihood ratio test (ML/GLRT). The number of bases chosen for each patch determines a tradeoff between representation accuracy and the ability to differentiate between distinct patches. We propose choosing the minimum number of bases that satisfy a constraint on the normalized mean squared representation accuracy. A mismatch analysis for LCMV and ML/GLRT is presented to show that this is an appropriate strategy for choosing the number of bases. The effectiveness of the patch basis model is demonstrated using real and simulated evoked response data. We show that significant changes in performance occur as the number of basis functions varies, and that very good results are obtained by allowing modest representation error","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/35124/01673616.pdf","startPage":"1740","endPage":"1754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2006.873743","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2006.873743","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673616","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Brain modeling","Maximum likelihood estimation","Inverse problems","Electroencephalography","Spatial resolution","Signal processing algorithms","Filtering algorithms","Testing","Neuroimaging","Hemodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","magnetoencephalography","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","physiological models","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cortical patch basis model","spatially extended neural activity","cortex","basis functions","arbitrary source activity representation","normalized mean squared representation error","basis function framework","linearly constrained minimum variance spatial filtering","maximum-likelihood signal estimation","generalized likelihood ratio test","normalized mean squared representation accuracy","mismatch analysis","patch basis model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cortical bases","cortical patches","extended sources","maximum-likelihood","MEG inverse problem","minimum variance beamformer"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Anisotropy","Brain Mapping","Cerebral Cortex","Computer Simulation","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electroencephalography","Evoked Potentials","Humans","Magnetoencephalography","Models, Neurological"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Cortical patch basis model for spatially extended neural activity","accessionNumber":"9039801","pubMedId":"16941830","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1673616/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cortical patch basis model for spatially extended neural activity","sourcePdf":"01673616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131997S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"35124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"35124","articleId":"1673616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1673617,"authors":[{"name":"K.

One of the major difficulties of the scalar-type MEG/EEG beamformer is the determination of accurate dipole orientation, which is essential to an effective spatial filter. This paper presents a new beamforming technique which exploits a maximum contrast criterion to maximize the ratio of the neuronal activity estimated in a specified active state to the activity estimated in a control state. This criterion leads to a closed-form solution of the dipole orientation.

Many sensing circuits depend on accumulating charge on a capacitor as the sensing method. Reset noise is the noise that occurs when the capacitor is reset prior to the charge accumulation cycle. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors which determine reset noise, and how this noise may be mitigated. The purpose of this paper is to show how capacitive reset noise can be reduced during the reset cycle. We present and analyze three circuits that implement the basic methods for directly reducing capacitive reset noise. In addition, we present a time-domain technique for analyzing the time-varying statistics of these circuits. This technique makes use of Itocirc calculus to obtain solutions to the time-varying stochastic differential equations.

The model provides information about the spectral properties of the distortion noise, which allows the analytical characterization of the signal-to-noise distortion ratio at the input of the demodulator. Oversampling, filtering, uniform, and optimal nonuniform quantization effects are taken into account. The optimal automatic gain control working point is evaluated for each parameter configuration. The differences from the results obtained by the classical pseudo-quantization noise model are highlighted showing that, due to the spectral characteristics, the gain introduced by oversampling is generally a few decibels lower than what foreseen by the classical theory. Moreover, the impact of these effects on the OFDM receiver performance degradation is evaluated and the validity of simplified approximations is discussed","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/35125/01673643.pdf","startPage":"1741","endPage":"1748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2006.875170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2006.875170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint clip and quantization effects characterization in OFDM receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","OFDM","Distortion","Analog-digital conversion","Signal to noise ratio","Information analysis","Signal analysis","Demodulation","Filtering","Gain control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","automatic gain control","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","quantisation (signal)","radio receivers","signal sampling","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clipping effect","thermal noise","analog-to-digital conversion","spectral properties","distortion noise","analytical characterization","signal-to-noise distortion ratio","oversampling quantization","filtering effect","OFDM receivers","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","uniform quantization","optimal nonuniform quantization","automatic gain control","pseudoquantization noise model","performance degradation","digital communication","nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantization","digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion","digital communication","nonlinear distortion","overflow"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Joint clip and quantization effects characterization in OFDM receivers","volume":"53","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1673643/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9042998","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint clip and quantization effects characterization in OFDM receivers","sourcePdf":"01673643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066612S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"35125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"35125","articleId":"1673643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1673644,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The 3MPLL also adaptively tracks and estimates the magnitude, phase angle, and frequency of the input signal; thus, its operation as a nonlinear state estimator. Characteristics of the 3MPLL including its mathematical equations as well as steady-state and dynamic responses are discussed in this paper. Comparisons are made between the proposed 3MPLL and conventional single-phase PLL (1PLL) and three-phase PLL (3PLL) systems. Advantages of the proposed system over the conventional methods and systems are also discussed. Structural simplicity and robustness of the 3MPLL system are its further features which make it desirable. In addition to the conventional applications of the 3PLL in the general area of power systems, the proposed 3MPLL can also be used for other applications which require smooth and adaptive synthesis of the instantaneous symmetrical components.

As opposed to parts I and II of this paper, where OOCs with cross-correlation lambda=1 were considered, we consider generalized OOCs with 1leslambdalesw, where w is the weight of the corresponding codes. To enhance the performance of such systems, we propose the use of an optical and logic gate receiver, which, in an ideal case, e.g., in the absence of any noise source, except the optical multiple-access interference, is optimum. Using some basic laws on probability, we present direct and exact solutions for OOCs with lambda=1,2,3,...,w, with the optical and logic gate as receiver. Using the exact solution, we obtain empirical solutions that can be easily used in optimizing the design criteria of such systems. From our optimization scheme, we obtain some fresh insight into the performance of OOCs with lambdages1.

In this paper, a multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD) technique is proposed for M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) STBCs. The new scheme can greatly narrow the 3-dB performance gap by extending the observation interval for differential decoding. The technique uses maximum-likelihood sequence detection instead of traditional symbol-by-symbol detection, and is carried out on the slow, flat Rayleigh fading channel. A generalized decision metric is derived for an observation interval of arbitrary length. It is shown that for a moderate number of symbols, MSDD provides approximately 1.5 dB performance improvement over conventional differential detection. In addition, a closed-form pairwise error probability and approximate bit-error probability (BEP) are derived for multiple-symbol differential binary PSK STBC. Results show that the theoretical BEP matches simulation results well.

We first address the average throughput of systems with a homogeneous average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and obtain its asymptotic expression. Compared with the exact throughput expression, the asymptotic one, which is applicable to a broader range of fading channels, is more concise and easier to get insights. Furthermore, we confirm the accuracy of the asymptotic results by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. For a system with heterogeneous SNRs, normalized-SNR-based scheduling needs to be used for fairness. We also investigate the asymptotic average throughput of the normalized-SNR-based scheduling, and prove that the average throughput in this case is less than that in the homogeneous case with a power constraint.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/35126/01673689.pdf","startPage":"1514","endPage":"1514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.878808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.878808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35126","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Throughput Analysis for Channel-Aware Scheduling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Peak to average power ratio","Redundancy","Processor scheduling","Performance analysis","Scheduling algorithm","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Numerical simulation","Power engineering computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Throughput Analysis for Channel-Aware Scheduling","volume":"54","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Throughput Analysis for Channel-Aware Scheduling","sourcePdf":"01673689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100283S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","isNumber":"35126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1673689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1673716,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Li","affiliation":["Microelectronics Reliability Engineering, Center for Reliability Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/35127/1673716/1673716-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaojun Li received the B.S. degree in physics and the M.S. degree in semiconductor device and physics from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in microelectronics reliability engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2004 and 2005, respectively.","His research work focused on deep submicrometer CMOS VLSI circuit reliability modeling, simulation, and design.

This paper used a simple SRAM circuit as an example to demonstrate how to apply SPICE to circuit reliability modeling, simulation, analysis, and design. The SRAM circuit, implemented with a commercial 0.25-mum technology, consists of functional blocks of 1-bit six-transistor cell, precharge, read/write control, and sense amplifier. The SRAM operation sequence of \"write 0, read 0, write 1, read 1\" was first simulated in SPICE to obtain the terminal voltage and current stress profiles of each transistor. Then, normalized lifetimes of all transistors in terms of each failure mechanism were calculated with the corresponding accelerated lifetime models. These lifetime values were sorted to single out the most damaged transistors. Finally, the selected transistors were substituted with failure equivalent circuit models, and SPICE simulations were performed again to characterize the circuit performance, functionality, and failure behaviors. The simulation shows that the 0.25-mum technology, hot-carrier injection (HCI), and time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) had significant effects on SRAM-cell stability and voltage-transfer characteristics, while negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) mainly degraded the cell transition speed when the cell state flipped. This illustrative SRAM simulation work proves that, with SPICE and the failure equivalent circuit models, circuit designers can better understand the damage effects of HCI/TDDB/NBTI on the circuit operation, quickly estimate the circuit lifetime, make appropriate performance/reliability tradeoffs, and formulate practical design guidelines to improve the circuit reliability","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/35127/01673716.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2006.876568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2006.876568","startPage":"235","endPage":"246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM circuit-failure modeling and reliability simulation with SPICE","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673716/","displayDocTitle":"SRAM circuit-failure modeling and reliability simulation with SPICE","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1673716/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"9039591","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM circuit-failure modeling and reliability simulation with SPICE","sourcePdf":"01673716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074187S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"35127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"35127","articleId":"1673716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1673724,"authors":[{"name":"A.

ASC addresses this problem with a softwarelike programming interface to hardware design (FPGAs) while keeping the performance of hand-designed circuits at the same time. ASC improves productivity by letting the programmer optimize the implementation on the algorithm level, the architecture level, the arithmetic level, and the gate level, all within the same C++ program. The increased productivity of ASC is applied to the hardware acceleration of a wide range of applications. Traditionally, hardware accelerators are tediously handcrafted to achieve top performance. ASC simplifies design-space exploration of hardware accelerators by transforming the hardware-design task into a software-design process, using only \"GNU compiler collection (GCC)\" and \"make\" to obtain a hardware netlist.

The proposed approach obtains the minimum cost quantum circuits for Miller gate, half adder, and full adder, which are better than previous results. This cost is minimum for any circuit using the set of quantum gates in this paper, where the control qubit of 2-qubit gates is always basis binary. In addition, the minimum quantum cost in the same manner for Fredkin, Peres, and Toffoli gates is proven. The method can also find the best conversion from an irreversible function to a reversible circuit as a byproduct of the generality of its formulation, thus synthesizing in principle arbitrary multi-output Boolean functions with quantum gate library. This paper constitutes the first successful experience of applying formal methods and satisfiability to quantum logic synthesis","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.858352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/35128/01673740.pdf","startPage":"1652","endPage":"1663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.858352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal synthesis of multiple output Boolean functions using a set of quantum gates by symbolic reachability analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673740/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal synthesis of multiple output Boolean functions using a set of quantum gates by symbolic reachability analysis","volume":"25","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9037705","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1673740/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal synthesis of multiple output Boolean functions using a set of quantum gates by symbolic reachability analysis","sourcePdf":"01673740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076867S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"35128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"35128","articleId":"1673740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1673746,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Dramatic improvement over traditional floorplanning methods is achieved by the explicit construction of strictly legal layouts for every partition block at every level of a cutsize-driven top-down hierarchy. By scalably incorporating legalization into the hierarchical flow, post hoc legalization is successfully eliminated. For large floorplanning benchmarks, an implementation, called partitioning to optimize module arrangement (PATOMA), generates solutions with half the wirelength of state-of-the-art floorplanners in orders of magnitude less run time. Experiments on standard Gigascale Systems Research Center benchmarks compare PATOMA to the Capo macro placer, the Traffic floorplanner, and to both the default and high-effort modes of the Parquet 4.0 floorplanner. With all blocks hard, PATOMA's average wirelength is comparable to the high-effort mode of Parquet 4.0 floorplanner and Capo, while PATOMA runs significantly faster. With all blocks soft, PATOMA produces wirelength 9% shorter on average than that of Parquet's default mode, and PATOMA runs seven times faster. For a new set of benchmarks with a mix of 500 to 2000 hard and soft blocks, PATOMA produces results with wirelengths roughly half of Parquet's, with a speedup of almost 200times","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.859519","startPage":"1719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/35128/01673746.pdf","endPage":"1732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.859519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673746/","displayDocTitle":"Fast floorplanning by look-ahead enabled recursive bipartitioning","volume":"25","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1673746/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9037711","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast floorplanning by look-ahead enabled recursive bipartitioning","sourcePdf":"01673746.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118364S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"35128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"35128","articleId":"1673746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1673747,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Although the compaction obtains an optimal area, it may not be good for meeting other objectives such as minimizing the total wire length, which is the first-order objective. It is not known in the literature how to place blocks to obtain an optimal wire length. This paper first shows that the problem can be formulated by linear programming. Thereafter, instead of using the general, but slow, linear programming, this paper proposes an efficient minimum-cost flow-based approach to solve it. This approach guarantees to obtain the minimum total wire length in polynomial time and meanwhile keep the minimum area by distributing white space smarter for a given floorplan topology. This paper also shows that the approach can be easily extended to handle constraints such as fixed frame (fixed area), input-output (IO) pins, preplaced blocks, boundary blocks, range placement, alignment and abutment, rectilinear blocks, soft blocks, one-dimensional cluster placement, and bounded net delay, without loss of optimality. Practically, the algorithm is so efficient that it finishes in less than 0.4 s for all Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) benchmarks of block placement. It is also very effective. Experimental results show that the wire length of very compact floorplans can even be improved by 4.2%.

While it is conceptually understood that a thermal equivalent circuit can be constructed to characterize the temperature gradients across the chip, direct and iterative solutions of the corresponding three-dimensional (3-D) equations are often intractable for a full-chip analysis. Integrated circuit (IC)-specific multigrid (MG) techniques for fast chip level thermal steady-state and transient simulation are proposed. This approach avoids an explicit construction of the matrix problem that is intractable for most full-chip problems. Specific MG treatments are proposed to cope with the strong anisotropy of the full-chip thermal problem that is created by the vast difference in material thermal properties and chip geometries. Importantly, this paper demonstrates that only with careful thermal modeling assumptions and appropriate choices for grid hierarchy, MG operators, and smoothing steps across grid points can a full-chip thermal problem be accurately and efficiently analyzed. This paper further speeds up the large thermal transient simulations by incorporating reduced-order thermal models that can be efficiently extracted under the same MG framework. The experiments carried out in this work have shown that the proposed methodology provides sufficient efficiency in both runtime and memory usage","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/35128/01673750.pdf","startPage":"1763","endPage":"1776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.858276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.858276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35128","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1673750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IC thermal simulation and modeling via efficient multigrid-based approaches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Temperature","Power system reliability","Power system modeling","Energy consumption","Packaging","System-on-a-chip","Integrated circuit reliability","Equivalent circuits","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","equivalent circuits","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit reliability","temperature control","thermal analysis","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IC thermal simulation","integrated circuit modeling","multigrid-based approaches","power consumption","packaging density","thermal equivalent circuit","temperature gradients","thermal steady-state simulation","material thermal properties","chip geometries","thermal modeling","grid hierarchy","MG operators","smoothing steps","thermal transient simulations","reduced-order thermal models","temperature control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated circuit thermal factor, integrated circuits, simulation, temperature control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1673750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"IC thermal simulation and modeling via efficient multigrid-based approaches","volume":"25","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1673750/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9037715","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IC thermal simulation and modeling via efficient multigrid-based approaches","sourcePdf":"01673750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089337S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"35128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"35128","articleId":"1673750","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1673751,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Gang Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Center, City University, Hong Kong, China","EM Academy, University of Zhejiang, Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/35128/1673751/1673751-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Gang Wang (M'04) was born in Guangdong, China.

First, a rigorous Gram-Schmidt row sampling is developed to replace the row sampling algorithm in IES/sup 3/, leading to a more stable algorithm. Second, to further enhance the efficiency of column sampling, a new scheme based on the idea of locating the interpolation points is presented. Error analyses indicate that the proposed schemes have higher accuracies than the original sampling in IES/sup 3/, especially when the number of sampled points is small. The IES/sup 3/ that uses one of these improved algorithms is called improved multilevel matrix QR factorization (IMLMQRF). These IMLMQRFs are applied in the magnetoquasistatic analysis of printed circuits on multilayered lossy medium for extractions of inductances and resistances.

Microprogram optimization is one way to increase efficiency and can be crucial in some applications. Optimization, in this context refers to a reduction/minimization of control store and/or execution time of microprograms. The numerous strategies are classified under four broad categories: word dimension reduction, bit dimension reduction, state reduction, and heuristic reduction. The various techniques are presented, analyzed, and compared. Unfortunately, the results of the survey are not too positive. The reason is that much of the work on optimization has been devoted to obtaining the absolute minimum solutions rather than \"good engineering reductions.\" Whether the reduction is being performed with respect to the word dimension, the bit dimension or the number of states existing techniques to obtain the optimum solution use exhaustive enumeration. Thus, the effort involved is prohibitive and there are no guarantees that significant reductions can be obtained. It is thus doubtful that an optimum solution can be justified even when the microcode produced is frequently executed. Heuristic reduction techniques do not guarantee an optimum solution but can provide some reduction with little effort. For the majority of the techniques studied, much further work remains to be done before any practical applications can be foreseen. Some methods however constitute steps in the right directions. Directions for future research are briefly outlined in the conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1976.1674537","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35143/01674537.pdf","startPage":"962","endPage":"973","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1976.1674537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microprogram Optimization: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1674537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1976","displayDocTitle":"Microprogram Optimization: A Survey","volume":"C-25","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microprogram Optimization: A Survey","sourcePdf":"01674537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046349S","chronDate":"Oct.  1976","isNumber":"35143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"51","articleId":"1674537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1674539,"authors":[{"name":"Dasgupta","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"38044444500"},{"name":"Tartar","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tartar","id":"38054443800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1674539","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Horizontal microprograms, microinstruction, optimization, parallelism, straight-line microprograms."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Horizontal microprograms, microinstruction, optimization, parallelism, straight-line microprograms."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1674539","doi":"10.1109/TC.1976.1674539","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","abstract":"We consider the problem of automatic identification of parallel microoperations in a given straight-line microprogram.

It is assumed that a fault can change the behavior of the basic cell of the array in an arbitrary way, as long as the cell remains a combinational circuit. It is further assumed that any number of cells can be faulty at any time. In this way, testing an array is equivalent to verifying the correctness of its truth table. That could be done exhaustively through the application of a set of tests whose size is exponential in N, the number of cells in the array. The procedure presented in this paper generates a test set whose size is constant (i.e., independent of the number N of cells in the array). Conditions (on the structure of the basic cell) for the application of this procedure are presented. A practical example illustrating the application of this procedure is presented. Bounds for the size of the derived test set are presented and it is shown how to modify the basic cell of an arbitrary array in order to test it with a constant number of tests.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1674660/","volume":"C-25","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1976","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Truth-Table Verification of an Iterative Logic Array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Truth-Table Verification of an Iterative Logic Array","sourcePdf":"01674660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037453S","chronDate":"June  1976","isNumber":"35148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"50","articleId":"1674660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1674662,"authors":[{"name":"Akers","affiliation":["Electronics Laboratory, General Electric Company Limited, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Akers","id":"37311955300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1674662","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fault diagnosis, fault test generation, logic networks, logic systems, stuck-at faults."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis, fault test generation, logic networks, logic systems, stuck-at faults."]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a logic system specifically designed for fault test generation. The system allows the user to impose a set of initial constraints on the elements of a logic network by indicating those values which an element may (or may not) assume for the test under consideration. He can be as vague or as specific as he wants in imposing these constraints. A set of logic tables is then used to automatically propagate the effects of these constraints throughout the network. As a result of this logic propagtion, the necessary values of the elements in the network become much more precisely (if not completely) defined. The tables also indicate whether or not the generated test (which may include a number of unspecified values) is sufficient to detect the given fault. If several different tests will suffice, the choices remaining are clearly indicated. In the case of a redundant lead (untestable fault), propagation through the tables automatically results in a logical inconsistency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Logic System for Fault Test Generation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1976.1674662","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35148/01674662.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1976.1674662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1674662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1674662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1976","displayDocTitle":"A Logic System for Fault Test Generation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-25","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"June 1976","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Logic System for Fault Test Generation","sourcePdf":"01674662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024474S","chronDate":"June  1976","isNumber":"35148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"20","articleId":"1674662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1674663,"authors":[{"name":"Muth","affiliation":["Brown Boveri and Cie, AG, Mannheim, Germany","Institute for Information Processing, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"lastName":"Muth","id":"38053066900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1674663","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":130,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Circuit testing, D-algorithm, diagnosis, many-valued model, sequential circuit, single and multiple faults, test generation."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit testing, D-algorithm, diagnosis, many-valued model, sequential circuit, single and multiple faults, test generation."]}],"abstract":"A nine-valued circuit model for test generation is introduced which takes care of multiple and repeated effects of a fault in sequential circuits.

Then it is shown that all minimal solutions of such a cost function always can be found among the following: minimal networks with a minimal number of gates as the first objective and a minimal number of connections as the second objective; minimal networks with a minimal number of connections as the first objective and a minimal number of gates as the second objective; and minimal networks which are associated with the above two types of minimal networks. All three of these types of minimal networks of NOR gates, as an example, are calculated by logical design programs based on integer programming, for all functions of 3 or less variables and also some functions of 4 variables which require 5 or less NOR gates. According to the computational results, for the majority of the functions the first type of minimal networks is identical to the second type, and for no function were networks of the third type found to exist.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35151/01674714.pdf","startPage":"893","endPage":"907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1976.1674714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1976.1674714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1674714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimization of Logic Networks Under a Generalized Cost Function","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Branch-and-bound method, emitter-coupled logic (ECL), generalized cost function, implicit enumeration method, integer programming, integrated circuit, integrated injection logic (IIL), logical design, minimization of the number of connections, minimization of the number of gates, NAND gates, NOR gates."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Branch-and-bound method, emitter-coupled logic (ECL), generalized cost function, implicit enumeration method, integer programming, integrated circuit, integrated injection logic (IIL), logical design, minimization of the number of connections, minimization of the number of gates, NAND gates, NOR gates."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1674714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1976","displayDocTitle":"Minimization of Logic Networks Under a Generalized Cost Function","volume":"C-25","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimization of Logic Networks Under a Generalized Cost Function","sourcePdf":"01674714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029253S","chronDate":"Sept.  1976","isNumber":"35151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1674714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1674718,"authors":[{"name":"Orcutt","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Naperville, IL, USA","Digital Systems Laboratory, Stanford Electronics Laboratories, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Orcutt","id":"37088046029"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1674718","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bit reversal, bitonic sorting, data routing, Illiac IV, parallel computation, perfect shuffle, permutations."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit reversal, bitonic sorting, data routing, Illiac IV, parallel computation, perfect shuffle, permutations."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1674718","abstract":"Much research has recently been done on processor interconnection schemes for parallel computers.

The values are then iteratively adjusted, and the probabilities are reinforced or weakened, in a manner dependent on the values and probabilities at neighboring points. For example, a point p's probability of being on a side is reinforced if p and its neighbors have similar slopes, and our estimate of p's slope can be improved by (say) averaging with these slopes. Similarly, p's probability of being an angle is reinforced if appropriate slope or curvature differences exist between p and its neighbors, and our estimate of p's curvature can be improved by taking the neighbors' slopes into account. A set of such reinforcement and adjustment rules is formulated, and examples are given of their effects on various types of shapes.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1977.1674746","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1977.1674746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35152","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35152/01674746.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Curve Segmentation by Relaxation Labeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1674746/","displayDocTitle":"Curve Segmentation by Relaxation Labeling","volume":"C-26","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1977","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1977","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Curve Segmentation by Relaxation Labeling","sourcePdf":"01674746.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023809S","chronDate":"Oct.  1977","isNumber":"35152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1674746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1674762,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao","affiliation":["IBM, Corporation, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Hsiao","id":"37336090700"},{"name":"Patel","affiliation":["IBM, Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Patel","id":"37339351600"},{"name":"Pradhan","affiliation":["IBM, Corporation, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA","University of Regina, Regina, Canada"],"lastName":"Pradhan","id":"37276263100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1674762","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Address generator, binary counter, error-correcting codes, fault-tolerant computing, linear-feedback shift register."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Address generator, binary counter, error-correcting codes, fault-tolerant computing, linear-feedback shift register."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1674762","abstract":"A novel technique for address generation is presented in this correspondence.

The hardware has the further feature that both the sine and the cosine of the argument are calculated simultaneously.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1977.1674791","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35154/01674791.pdf","startPage":"1283","endPage":"1286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1977.1674791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Hardware for Sine-Cosine Function","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1977","displayDocTitle":"Digital Hardware for Sine-Cosine Function","volume":"C-26","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1674791/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1977","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Hardware for Sine-Cosine Function","sourcePdf":"01674791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041383S","chronDate":"Dec.  1977","isNumber":"35154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1674791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1674795,"authors":[{"name":"Roth","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

In particular, the method is suitable for fast evaluation of mathematical functions in hardware.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1977.1674900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35159/01674900.pdf","startPage":"667","endPage":"680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1977.1674900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Hardware-Oriented Method for Evaluation of Functions and Computations in a Digital Computer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1674900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1977","displayDocTitle":"A General Hardware-Oriented Method for Evaluation of Functions and Computations in a Digital Computer","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","volume":"C-26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1977","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Hardware-Oriented Method for Evaluation of Functions and Computations in a Digital Computer","sourcePdf":"01674900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037628S","chronDate":"July  1977","isNumber":"35159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"57","articleId":"1674900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1674901,"authors":[{"name":"Trivedi","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA","Department of Computer Science, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Trivedi","id":"37273190200"},{"name":"Ercegovac","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA","Department of Computer Science, School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ercegovac","id":"37065690100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1674901","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":114,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1674901","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Computer arithmetic, division, multiplication, on-line algorithms, pipelining, radix, redundancy."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer arithmetic, division, multiplication, on-line algorithms, pipelining, radix, redundancy."]}],"abstract":"In this paper, on-line algorithms for division and multiplication are developed.

Such lattices arise from problems in pattern classification, in nonlinear regression, in defining logical equations, and a number of related areas. When viewed as the partitioning of a vector space, each point in the lattice corresponds to a subregion of the space which is relatively homogeneous with respect to classification or range of a dependent variable. Optimality is defined in terms of a general cost function which includes the following: 1) min-max path length (i. e., minimize the maximum number of nodes traversed in making a decision); 2) minimum number of nodes in the tree; and 3) expected path length. It is shown that an optimal tree can be recursively constructed through the application of invariant imbedding (dynamic programming). An algorithm is detailed which embodies this recursive approach. The algorithm allows the assignment of a \"don't care\" label to elements of L.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35161/01674938.pdf","startPage":"905","endPage":"916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1977.1674938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1977.1674938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1674938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algorithm for Constructing Optimal Binary Decision Trees","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Decision trees, dynamic programming, logic optimization, nonlinear regression, pattern recognition."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision trees, dynamic programming, logic optimization, nonlinear regression, pattern recognition."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1674938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1977","displayDocTitle":"An Algorithm for Constructing Optimal Binary Decision Trees","volume":"C-26","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1977","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algorithm for Constructing Optimal Binary Decision Trees","sourcePdf":"01674938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023369S","chronDate":"Sept.  1977","isNumber":"35161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"63","articleId":"1674938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1674939,"authors":[{"name":"Narendra","affiliation":["Honeywell Systems and Research Center, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA","Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Narendra","id":"38054520600"},{"name":"Fukunaga","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Fukunaga","id":"37286994600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1674939","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":744,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2844},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Branch and bound, combinatorial optimization, feature selection, recursive computation."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Branch and bound, combinatorial optimization, feature selection, recursive computation."]}],"abstract":"A feature subset selection algorithm based on branch and bound techniques is developed to select the best subset of m features from an n-feature set.

Like a conventional retry, an ADR is a re-execution of an operation that initially fails to produce an error-free result. Unlike a conventional retry, an ADR uses an alternate representation of the initial data. The choice of the alternate data representation and the design of the processing circuits combine to insure that even an error due to a permanent fault is not repeated during retry. Error correction is provided at a hardware cost comparable to that of a conventional retry capability.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Alternate-data retry (ADR)","availability","error correction","fault neutralization","morphic circuits","recoverable","self-checking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternate-data retry (ADR)","availability","error correction","fault neutralization","morphic circuits","recoverable","self-checking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675044","doi":"10.1109/TC.1978.1675044","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35166/01675044.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1978.1675044","startPage":"106","endPage":"112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Correction by Alternate-Data Retry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error Correction by Alternate-Data Retry","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1978","volume":"C-27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 1978","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Correction by Alternate-Data Retry","sourcePdf":"01675044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027128S","chronDate":"Feb.  1978","isNumber":"35166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"34","articleId":"1675044","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1675046,"authors":[{"name":"Perkins","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science Research Laboratories, General Motors Corporation, Warren, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Perkins","id":"38055161700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675046","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":223,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":332},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"A vision system has been developed which can determine the position and orientation of complex curved objects in gray-level noisy scenes.

A typical code which has found wide application is the binary Hamming code. This code corrects single bit errors. With the advent of large-scale integration (LSI) storage array technology, the likelihood of errors which exceed the correction and detection capability of such a code is significant. A serious and heretofore unanswered question is the error detection capability of a given code which is implemented and decoded for single error correction, particularly when a storage array chip or card carrying multiple bits from the codeword has failed. In order to identify this capability, a new reliability parameter called package detectability is defined. This paper also presents a method for computing package detectability. The analysis has been performed on a number of codes in order to optimize the packaging for maximum detectability. In addition, a class of distance 3 codes with maximal b-bit package detectability is given.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1978.1675072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35167/01675072.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1978.1675072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and Generation of Error Correcting Codes for Package Failures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1978","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and Generation of Error Correcting Codes for Package Failures","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","volume":"C-27","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1978","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and Generation of Error Correcting Codes for Package Failures","sourcePdf":"01675072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046866S","chronDate":"March  1978","isNumber":"35167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"30","articleId":"1675072","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1675075,"authors":[{"name":"Parker","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Company, Loveland, CO, USA"],"lastName":"Parker","id":"37065716500"},{"name":"McCluskey","lastName":"McCluskey","id":"37086976672"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675075","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Multinominal Markov processes","output porbabilities","regular expressions","sequential circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multinominal Markov processes","output porbabilities","regular expressions","sequential circuits"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a number of methods for finding sequential circuit output probabilities using regular expressions.

Effectiveness studies for arithmetic error codes have shown their value for concurrent detection of faults in arithmetic processors, data transmission subsystems, and main storage units in fault-tolerant computers. In this paper, it is shown that the same class of codes is also quite effective for detecting storage errors in both shift-register and magnetic-recording mass memories. Some of the results are more general and deal with properties of arithmetic error codes in detecting unidirectional failures. For example, it is shown that a low-cost arithmetic error code with check modulus A = 2N - 1 can detect any unidirectional failure which affects fewer than N bits. The use of arithmetic error codes for checking of mass memories is further justified since it eliminates the need for hard-core or self-checking code translators and reduces the number of different

It allows errors to be detected upon occurrence without testing, whether the error is caused by a permanent or intermittent fault. However, there are relatively few codes for which efficient self-checking checkers have been designed. In this paper we present procedures for designing efficient self-checking checkers for m-out-of-n codes (i.e., codes where each valid code word consists of m bits with value 1 and n \u2013 m bits with value 0). Codes for arbitrary values of m and n are considered. Realizations which require significantly less logic than previously known realizations are presented for all cases except n = 2m and m = 1. These checkers are totally self-checking for all single and unidirectional multiple stuck-type faults. They are also very easy to test compared with previously presented realizations. Saving in logic complexity and testing complexity of 70 to 97 percent is demonstrated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35170/01675138.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TC.1978.1675138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1978.1675138","startPage":"482","endPage":"490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Design of Self-Checking Checker for any m-Out-of-n Code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675138/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Design of Self-Checking Checker for any m-Out-of-n Code","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-27","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"June 1978","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Design of Self-Checking Checker for any m-Out-of-n Code","sourcePdf":"01675138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045716S","chronDate":"June  1978","isNumber":"35170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"59","articleId":"1675138","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1675139,"authors":[{"name":"Smith","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA","Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Smith","id":"37277158600"},{"name":"Metze","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Metze","id":"37318790500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675139","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":197,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675139","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Error-detecting codes","fault-secure networks","path sensitization","self-checking networks","self-testing networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error-detecting codes","fault-secure networks","path sensitization","self-checking networks","self-testing networks"]}],"abstract":"Strongly fault secure logic networks are defined and are shown to include totally self-checking networks as a special case.

Fault detection can be achieved by comparing some statistic of the circuit under test, e.g., the frequency of logic ones at an output, with the value of that statistic previously determined for the fault-free circuit. In this paper, we show that random compact testing can efficiently detect failures in both combinational and sequential circuits. Although this testing method cannot guarantee detection of all faults, it provides a simple way to detect the vast majority of failures in most circuits. The effects of failures inside combinational circuits are modeled in relation to the statistical property measured by the test and a general evaluation of the testing efficiency is obtained. The probability of detection is shown to increase with the test length and to be dependent upon test parameters such as the statistics of the input sequence. For sequential circuits, the uncertainty of the initial state necessitates an initialization step, which is a long sequence of random inputs. The length of such an initialization sequence is circuit dependent, but for most circuits, proper initialization can be achieved in a few seconds. Most failures inside the memory elements are easily detected, even with short tests. Random compact testing can also detect most of the failures inside the excitation logic and the output circuitry. There, as for combinational circuits, its efficiency is largely dependent upon the test length.

Of the three main subsystems, image preprocessing, single character recognition, and contextual postprocessing, the last two will be considered in detail. A multiple-channel/multiple-choice approach is taken in designing the overall system. The character images produced by the image preprocessing subsystem are fed into three parallel single character recognition (SCR) channels. Each channel classifies the raster image according to one of the three character types: capital letter, small letter, or numeral. A second degree polynomial classifier is required in order to satisfy the multifont requirements of address reading. Each SCR channel outputs a rank-ordered list of potential character meanings for the character type being processed and a channel-specific figure of confidence. This figure of confidence serves a twofold purpose. First, it is used to determine the number of alternatives in the rank-ordered list, and secondly, it is used by the subsequent contextual postprocessor in calculating a word-specific discriminant function designed to discriminate between four different kinds of words: numeric, all upper case, all lower case, and lower case with upper case initial.

This multiplier operates in time 0(n), where n is the maximum of the lengths of the multiplier and multiplicand, both of which are fixed point, expressed in binary notation. It is a logical circuit consisting of 2n modules, each being only slightly more complex than a full adder; instead of three inputs and two outputs, each module has five inputs and three outputs. A logical circuit realization is given for the modules. But perhaps the most significant aspect of this design is the property that the input is required only bit-sequentially and the output is generated bit-sequentially, both at the rate of one bit per time step, least significant bit first.

It is used as a basis for analyzing various types of interconnection networks that have been discussed in the literature. The networks are evaluated in terms of the lower and upper bounds on the time required for each of the networks discussed to simulate the other networks. SIMD machine algorithms are presented as proofs of the upper time bounds on these simulation tasks. These simulations are used to demonstrate techniques for proving the correctness of SIMD machine algorithms, i.e., analyzing the simultaneous flow of N data items among N processors. Processor address masks, a concise notation for activating and deactivating processors, are used in the algorithms. The methods used to prove the lower bounds and to construct (and prove correct) simulation algorithms to show the upper bounds can be generalized and applied to the analysis of other networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1979","volume":"C-28","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1979","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Model of SIMD Machines and a Comparison of Various Interconnection Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model of SIMD Machines and a Comparison of Various Interconnection Networks","sourcePdf":"01675280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041315S","chronDate":"Dec.  1979","isNumber":"35177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"114","articleId":"1675280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1675284,"authors":[{"name":"Vlasenko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Vlasenko","id":"37087337609"},{"name":"Rao","affiliation":["University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Rao","id":"37089046241"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675284","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Discrete transforms","fast algorithms","Kronecker products"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete transforms","fast algorithms","Kronecker products"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Matrix Treatment of Discrete Transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675284","doi":"10.1109/TC.1979.1675284","startPage":"934","endPage":"938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35177/01675284.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1979.1675284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35177","abstract":"An unified matrix treatment is developed for some discrete transforms such as Haar (HT), rationalized Haar (RHT), rapid (RT), modified Wash\u2013Hadamard (MWHT), Hadamard\u2013 Haar (HHT)r, and rationalized Hadamard\u2013Haar (RHHT)r.

In this paper we consider the same problem except that one processor has limited memory capacity. Although this problem is NP-complete, techniques based on the Gomory\u2013Hu tree from network flow theory can be applied to instances of the problem to obtain a reduction in complexity. A new technique based on a graph called the inclusive cut graph is shown to be an even more powerful tool. These two techniques can solve some instances of the problem completely; still others are reduced sufficiently to be susceptible to enumerative techniques. In the worst case, the techniques yield no reduction in problem size.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675348/","volume":"C-28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1979","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Assignment of Tasks in a Distributed Processor System with Limited Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assignment of Tasks in a Distributed Processor System with Limited Memory","sourcePdf":"01675348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089638S","chronDate":"April  1979","isNumber":"35180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"82","articleId":"1675348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1675363,"authors":[{"name":"Despain","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Despain","id":"37344362400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675363","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":779},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"A new method of deriving very fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms is described.

The overall architecture of the computer as well as the organization of its individual components are discussed. Several key concepts which are vital to database management are incorporated in the design and organization of the components. The concepts of tracks-in-parallel read-out and logic-per-some-track processing are provided in an on-line database store for the purpose of achieving high-volume content-addressability. The use of auxiliary information about the database for access precision and control has resulted in the design of a structure memory, an array of content-addressable memory and processor pairs, for large collections of indices. The choice of technologies for the implementation of these components is considered in terms of their cost and performance. Modified moving-head disk technology is chosen in order to support the very large on-line database store. Emerging technologies such as magnetic bubbles and CCD's are chosen for the structure memory on the basis of their matching performance with the on-line database store and their capability for parallel-in-blocks-and-serial-within-block processing. Five other important components are also disdissed in the paper. Their role in the database computer and relationship with the structure memory and on-line database store are delineated.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1979.1675381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35182/01675381.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1979.1675381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DBC\u2014A Database Computer for Very Large Databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1979","displayDocTitle":"DBC\u2014A Database Computer for Very Large Databases","volume":"C-28","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675381/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1979","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DBC\u2014A Database Computer for Very Large Databases","sourcePdf":"01675381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047257S","chronDate":"June  1979","isNumber":"35182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"49","articleId":"1675381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1675383,"authors":[{"name":"Schuster","affiliation":["Tandem Computers, Inc.orporated, Cupertino, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Schuster","id":"38042074800"},{"name":"Nguyen","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38042989400"},{"name":"Ozkarahan","affiliation":["Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"lastName":"Ozkarahan","id":"37389613400"},{"name":"Smith","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Smith","id":"37334300500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675383","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAP.2\u2014An Associative Processor for Databases and Its Applications","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["-Access methods","array processors","associative memories","associative processors","bubble memory","cellular memories","charge-coupled device (CCD) memory","computer architecture","database machines","database management systems","disk memory","microprocessors","parallel processors","random access memory (RAM)","secondary storage devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["-Access methods","array processors","associative memories","associative processors","bubble memory","cellular memories","charge-coupled device (CCD) memory","computer architecture","database machines","database management systems","disk memory","microprocessors","parallel processors","random access memory (RAM)","secondary storage devices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675383","abstract":"RAP\u2014a Relational Associative Processor\u2014is a back-end or peripheral device to augment a general purpose computer for implementing a database management system (DBMS) Its architecture is based on the fact that database operations are inherently set-oriented and that data base addressing is best accomplished through associative reference to achieve high data independence.

The single pattern-sensitive fault (SPSF) model is used in which operations addressed to at most one memory cell are allowed to be faulty at any time. The influence of an SPSF affecting cell Ci is restricted to a fixed set of cells called the neighborhood of Ci. A new method is presented for efficiently generating the sequence of writes required in an SPSF test. This method yields optimal sequences for a useful class of neighborhoods called tiling neighborhoods. It is observed that RAM neighborhoods can be interpreted as polyominoes. A general procedure is given for constructing an SPSF test containing the minimum number of writes but a nonminimum number of reads. The difficult problem of minimizing the number of reads in an SPSF test is investigated for the 2-cell memory M2. A test of length 36 for M2 is derived which is optimal under certain reasonable restrictions. It is demonstrated that minimum-length SPSF tests can be inherently asymmetric.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1980.1675556","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35191/01675556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1980.1675556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35191","startPage":"249","endPage":"254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing Memories for Single-Cell Pattern-Sensitive Faults","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Testing Memories for Single-Cell Pattern-Sensitive Faults","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675556/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1980","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing Memories for Single-Cell Pattern-Sensitive Faults","sourcePdf":"01675556.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020006S","chronDate":"March  1980","isNumber":"35191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"81","articleId":"1675556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1675558,"authors":[{"name":"Johnson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, USA"],"lastName":"Johnson","id":"38038844600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675558","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":149},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digital Quarter Square Multiplier","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Absolute value circuit","digital quarter square multiplication","high-speed digital multiplication","ROM product tables"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Absolute value circuit","digital quarter square multiplication","high-speed digital multiplication","ROM product tables"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675558","abstract":"An application of the quarter square multiplication technique used in analog computing is proposed for digital multiplication.

The computations pertaining to the submatrices can be carried out using multidimensional cyclic convolutions. Algorithms are also developed to perform the computations associated with the submatrices that are parts of larger group tables.

This perspective leads to a technique for obtaining the greatest lower bound on the multiple fault coverage capability of an SFDTS by means of a simple table look-up process. In addition to generalizing previously known results regarding multiple fault coverage, two particularly interesting results obtained from this approach are as follows: 1) On the average, every SFDTS for an internal fan-out-free network covers 92 percent of all multiple faults of sizes 8 and less. 2) On the average, every SFDTS for an internal fan-out-free network covers at least 46.1 percent of all multiple faults.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1980.1675567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35192/01675567.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"299","doi":"10.1109/TC.1980.1675567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generic Fault Characterizations for Table Look-Up Coverage Bounding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1980","displayDocTitle":"Generic Fault Characterizations for Table Look-Up Coverage Bounding","volume":"C-29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1980","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675567/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generic Fault Characterizations for Table Look-Up Coverage Bounding","sourcePdf":"01675567.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061567S","chronDate":"April  1980","isNumber":"35192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"12","articleId":"1675567","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1675570,"authors":[{"name":"Kitajima","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"lastName":"Kitajima","id":"37270821300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675570","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Digital image processing","discrete cosine transform","fast Karhunen\u2013Loeve transform","Karhunen\u2013Loeve transform","residual correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital image processing","discrete cosine transform","fast Karhunen\u2013Loeve transform","Karhunen\u2013Loeve transform","residual correlation"]}],"abstract":"A new discrete cosine transform is developed in such a way that its closeness to the Karhunen\u2013Loeve transform can be established straightforwardly. The transform is characterized by a symmetric matrix and will be referred to as the symmetric cosine transform (SCT). It is shown that a simple window on the data vector makes its covariance matrix more tractable for the SCT. Since the derivation of the SCT is, to some extent, similar to that of the fast KLT proposed by Jain, its advantages over the FKLT are discussed. The new transform is also compared with the conventional DCT proposed by Ahmed et al. The performance of the SCT is better than that of the DCT with respect to computational efficiency, the residual correlation, and the rate-distortion criterion. The SCT is also convenient in hardware implementation as both the forward and reverse operations can be handled by a single apparatus.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Symmetric Cosine Transform","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1980.1675570","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35192/01675570.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1980.1675570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35192","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1980","displayDocTitle":"A Symmetric Cosine Transform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-29","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"April 1980","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Symmetric Cosine Transform","sourcePdf":"01675570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046716S","chronDate":"April  1980","isNumber":"35192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"39","articleId":"1675570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1675574,"authors":[{"name":"Maher","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Maher","id":"38048419400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675574","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fast convolution","FFT","finite computation structures","generalized discrete Fourier transforms","modular ring extensions","two-dimensional digital filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast convolution","FFT","finite computation structures","generalized discrete Fourier transforms","modular ring extensions","two-dimensional digital filtering"]}],"abstract":"A divisibility criterion is given for the existence of a Fourier transform over algebraic extensions of the ring of integers mod M which is generally easy to apply.

Classical fault detection methods based on the gate and flip-flop level or on the state diagram level description of microprocessors are not suitable for test generation. The problem is further compounded by the availability of a large variety of microprocessors which differ widely in their organization, instruction repertoire, addressing modes, data storage, and manipulation facilities, etc. In this paper, a general graph-theoretic model is developed at the register transfer level. Any microprocessor can be easily modeled using information only about its instruction set and the functions performed. This information is readily available in the user's manual. A fault model is developed on a functional level quite independent of the implementation details. The effects of faults in the fault model are investigated at the level of the graph-theoretic model. Test generation procedures are proposed which take the microprocessor organization and the instruction set as parameters and generate tests to detect all the faults in the fault model.

The knowledge of these values allows us to identify fault situations in N* (causes) which are compatible with the applied test and the obtained response (the effect). A fault situation specifies faulty as well as fault-free lines. Other applications include identifying the existence of nonstuck faults in N* and determination of faults not detected by a given test, including redundant faults. The latter application allows for the generation of tests for multiple faults without performing fault enumeration.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1980.1675604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1980.1675604","startPage":"451","endPage":"460","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35194/01675604.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Fault Diagnosis in Combinational Circuits Based on an Effect-Cause Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1980","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Fault Diagnosis in Combinational Circuits Based on an Effect-Cause Analysis","publicationDate":"June 1980","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","volume":"C-29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675604/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Fault Diagnosis in Combinational Circuits Based on an Effect-Cause Analysis","sourcePdf":"01675604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055788S","chronDate":"June  1980","isNumber":"35194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"82","articleId":"1675604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1675606,"authors":[{"name":"Pradhan","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Pradhan","id":"37276263100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675606","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675606","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Coset codes","decoder logic","error correction","error detection","erasure decoding","mass memories","multiple errors","multiple faults","random errors","read-only memories","self-checking","shift register memories","transient faults","TSC checkers","two-rail checkers","unidirectional errors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coset codes","decoder logic","error correction","error detection","erasure decoding","mass memories","multiple errors","multiple faults","random errors","read-only memories","self-checking","shift register memories","transient faults","TSC checkers","two-rail checkers","unidirectional errors"]}],"abstract":"Separable error-correcting/detecting codes are developed that provide protection against combinations of both unidirectional and random errors.

The key problem is multiple access of the shared broadcast channel. The performance of the R-ALOHA protocol for multiple access is studied in this paper. Two user models with Poisson message arrivals are analyzed; each message consists of a group of packets with a general probability distribution for group size. In the first model, each user handles one message at a time. In the second model, each user has infinite buffering capacity for queueing. Analytic models are developed for characterizing message delay and channel utilization. Bounds on channel throughput are established for two slightly different protocols. Numerical results from both analysis and simulation are presented to illustrate the accuracy of the analytic models as well as performance characteristics of the R-ALOHA protocol.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35195/01675630.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1980.1675630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1980.1675630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35195","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet Broadcast Networks\u2014A Performance Analysis of the R-ALOHA Protocol","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Broadcast channel","broadcast networks","contention algorithms","multiple access protocols","packet broadcasting","performance analysis","queueing","R-ALOHA","satellite networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast channel","broadcast networks","contention algorithms","multiple access protocols","packet broadcasting","performance analysis","queueing","R-ALOHA","satellite networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1980","displayDocTitle":"Packet Broadcast Networks\u2014A Performance Analysis of the R-ALOHA Protocol","volume":"C-29","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1980","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet Broadcast Networks\u2014A Performance Analysis of the R-ALOHA Protocol","sourcePdf":"01675630.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044482S","chronDate":"July  1980","isNumber":"35195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"122","articleId":"1675630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":1675633,"authors":[{"name":"Chin","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"lastName":"Chin","id":"38044861500"},{"name":"Fok","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"lastName":"Fok","id":"38040733800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675633","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":107},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bubble sort","Demuth's Algorithm","loading","magnetic bubbles","merging","odd-even transposition sort","period","shift-register loops","sorting","switches","uniform ladder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bubble sort","Demuth's Algorithm","loading","magnetic bubbles","merging","odd-even transposition sort","period","shift-register loops","sorting","switches","uniform ladder"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents two sorting algorithms on the uniform ladder (a new storage device based on charged coupled devices, or magnetic bubbles implementation, proposed by Chen et al.). It is assumed that control and comparison timings are negligible when compared to the relatively slow bubble movements. The first algorithm (Algorithm 1) enables the sorting process on a single ladder to be completely embedded in the input/output time (whereas Chen's algorithm (SLISO) has a 20 percent unoverlapped sorting time in the load-sort-unload process). When one ladder cannot accommodate all the input records and two or more ladders are needed, Algorithm 2 attains a negligible unoverlapped sorting time (which can be removed with a minor modification in the system hardware and hence in Algorithm 2). In comparison, Algorithm 2 obviates the need for explicit merging of the ladders, which is required in Chen's algorithm (MLISO). This implies that unlike the MLISO scheme, ladders are not tied up for merging, and can be recycled once their contents are outputted. Therefore, in a real processing environment, the number of ladders required by Algorithm 2 may even be less than the theoretical minimum which can be attained by the MLISO scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1980.1675633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35195/01675633.pdf","startPage":"618","endPage":"631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1980.1675633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Sorting Algorithms on Uniform Ladders (Multiple Shift-Register Loops)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675633/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Sorting Algorithms on Uniform Ladders (Multiple Shift-Register Loops)","volume":"C-29","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1980","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Sorting Algorithms on Uniform Ladders (Multiple Shift-Register Loops)","sourcePdf":"01675633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03174S","chronDate":"July  1980","isNumber":"35195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1675633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1675641,"authors":[{"name":"David","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Automatique de Grenoble, Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"lastName":"David","id":"37338041000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675641","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":54},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675641","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Compact testing","distinction potential","feedback shift register","FSR testing","resolution","fault detection","fault distinction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compact testing","distinction potential","feedback shift register","FSR testing","resolution","fault detection","fault distinction"]}],"abstract":"A compact testing method called feedback shift register testing (FSR testing) is presented and its properties, concerning detection and diagnosis, are given.

Several techniques for the prevention of SFD are known, but all exact some cost in terms of efficient and flexible packet handling. An ideal SFD-prevention technique is as unobtrusive as possible; it imposes no routing restrictions on packets, does not require that the buffer pool on each node grow with network size, and imposes no buffer-pool partitioning. All SFD-prevention techniques described so far lack some or all of these desirable properties. The new algorithm here described has all of them; in return, it imposes other unconventional costs. Under certain circumstances it requires that packets be rerouted around areas of potential deadlock, and one arbitrarily chosen node is required to accept within finite time any packet seeking entrance to its buffer pool, even if this requires erasing some packet. It is argued nonetheless that these costs are imposed infrequently enough and are sufficiently well manageable by heuristic techniques to make this new algorithm an attractive and practical alternative to the older techniques. An implementation designed for a microprocessor network now under construction is described.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1981.1675690","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35198/01675690.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1981.1675690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35198","startPage":"709","endPage":"715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DAG-Based Algorithm for Prevention of Store-and-Forward Deadlock in Packet Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A DAG-Based Algorithm for Prevention of Store-and-Forward Deadlock in Packet Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-30","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1981","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DAG-Based Algorithm for Prevention of Store-and-Forward Deadlock in Packet Networks","sourcePdf":"01675690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029033S","chronDate":"Oct.  1981","isNumber":"35198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"62","articleId":"1675690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1675693,"authors":[{"name":"Tse-Yun Feng","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Tse-Yun Feng","id":"37087262085"},{"name":"Chuan-Lin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Chuan-Lin Wu","id":"37087146765"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675693","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Baseline network","fault detection and location","fault model","multiple faults","multistage interconnection networks","parallel processing","single fault"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Baseline network","fault detection and location","fault model","multiple faults","multistage interconnection networks","parallel processing","single fault"]}],"abstract":"To study the fault-diagnosis method for a class of multistage interconnection networks a general fault model is first constructed.

In order to do this a complete, machine independent method of representing the microoperations of real machines had to be developed; and the compaction algorithms had to be recast to use this representation. The compaction algorithms were then implemented and tested on microcode produced by a compiler for a high-level microprogramming language. The results of these experiments were that for all cases examined the first-come first-served and list scheduling algorithms produced microcode compacted into a minimal number of microinstructions in time that was a polynomial function of order two of the number of input microoperations.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1981.1675826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1981.1675826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35205/01675826.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Experiments in Local Microcode Compaction for Horizontal Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1981","displayDocTitle":"Some Experiments in Local Microcode Compaction for Horizontal Machines","volume":"C-30","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Experiments in Local Microcode Compaction for Horizontal Machines","sourcePdf":"01675826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033471S","chronDate":"July  1981","isNumber":"35205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"149","articleId":"1675826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1675827,"authors":[{"name":"Fisher","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA","Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Fisher","id":"37437854300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675827","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":703,"citationCountPatent":94,"totalDownloads":726},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Data dependency","global microcode optimization","microcode compaction","parallel instruction scheduling","parallel processing","resource conflict"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data dependency","global microcode optimization","microcode compaction","parallel instruction scheduling","parallel processing","resource conflict"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675827","abstract":"Microcode compaction is the conversion of sequential microcode into efficient parallel (horizontal) microcode.

This scheme can be introduced to conventional computer systems without changing their architecture. In this scheme, sorting is divided into two stages, the ordering process and the rearranging one. The latter can be efficiently performed by central processing units or intelligent memory devices. For implementations of the ordering process by VLSI technology, we design a new hardware algorithm of parallel enumeration sorting circuits whose processing time is linearly proportional to the number of data for sorting. Data are serially transmitted between the sorting circuit and memory devices and the total communication between them is minimized. The basic structure used in the algorithm is called a bus connected cellular array structure with pipeline and parallel processing. The circuit consists of a linear array of one type of simple cell and two buses connecting all cells for efficient global communications in the circuit. The sorting circuit is simple, regular and small enough for realization by today's VLSI technology. We discuss several applications of the sorting circuit and evaluate its performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35211/01675943.pdf","startPage":"1192","endPage":"1201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1982.1675943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1982.1675943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35211","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Parallel Enumeration Sorting Scheme for VLSI","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bus connected cellular array","database machine","merging","multikey sort","parallel enumeration sort","parallel sorting algorithm","pipeline","sorting","VLSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bus connected cellular array","database machine","merging","multikey sort","parallel enumeration sort","parallel sorting algorithm","pipeline","sorting","VLSI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","displayDocTitle":"The Parallel Enumeration Sorting Scheme for VLSI","volume":"C-31","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Parallel Enumeration Sorting Scheme for VLSI","sourcePdf":"01675943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06823S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"35211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"49","articleId":"1675943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1675944,"authors":[{"name":"McMillen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"McMillen","id":"37087820355"},{"name":"Siegel","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Siegel","id":"37087352152"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675944","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1675944","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Augmented data manipulator (ADM)","broadcast routing tags","distributed processing","dynamic rerouting","interconnection networks","inverse augmented data manipulator (IADM)","MIMD machines","parallel processing","PASM","routing tags"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Augmented data manipulator (ADM)","broadcast routing tags","distributed processing","dynamic rerouting","interconnection networks","inverse augmented data manipulator (IADM)","MIMD machines","parallel processing","PASM","routing tags"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1982.1675944","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35211/01675944.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1982.1675944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing Schemes for the Augmented Data Manipulator Network in an MIMD System","abstract":"There have been many multistage interconnection networks proposed in the literature for interconnecting the processors that comprise large parallel processing systems.

The following four matrix computations are shown systematically partitionable into submatrix operations, which are feasible for direct VLSI implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1982.1675945","startPage":"1215","endPage":"1224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1982.1675945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35211","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35211/01675945.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partitioned Matrix Algorithms for VLSI Arithmetic Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675945/","displayDocTitle":"Partitioned Matrix Algorithms for VLSI Arithmetic Systems","volume":"C-31","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partitioned Matrix Algorithms for VLSI Arithmetic Systems","sourcePdf":"01675945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037708S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"35211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"78","articleId":"1675945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1675955,"authors":[{"name":"Hafer","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Hafer","id":"38042923100"},{"name":"Parker","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Parker","id":"37275825200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1675955","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Automated synthesis","computer-aided design","design automation","hardware-descriptive language","hardware specification","ISP","logic design","register-transfer level"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automated synthesis","computer-aided design","design automation","hardware-descriptive language","hardware specification","ISP","logic design","register-transfer level"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a portion of the Carnegie-Mellon University Design Automation (CMU-DA) research.

The allocator selects registers and data operators and interconnects them with data paths to form a data part capable of implementing the data operations specified in the behavior. Results indicate that the allocator's performance compares favorably with a human designer when designing an elevator controller and a reduced PDP-8/E.

The performance index is the average number of active processors, called processing power. From processing power a variety of other performance measures can be derived as dictated by the specific processor application. Exact models are first introduced and are illustrated with a simple example. The computational complexity of the exact models is shown to increase very rapidly with system size, thus making the exact analysis impractical even for medium size systems. To overcome the complexity of computation, several approximate models are introduced. The approximate results are compared with the exact ones and found to be surprisingly accurate for a wide range of configurations.

An error model for the derived residue arithmetic unit is also derived and experimentally verified.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35214/01675999.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"325","doi":"10.1109/TC.1982.1675999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1982.1675999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Autoscale Residue Multiplier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1675999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1982","displayDocTitle":"An Autoscale Residue Multiplier","publicationDate":"April 1982","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-31","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Autoscale Residue Multiplier","sourcePdf":"01675999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04291S","chronDate":"April  1982","isNumber":"35214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1675999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1676004,"authors":[{"name":"Nassimi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Nassimi","id":"37087275732"},{"name":"Sahni","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Sahni","id":"37087277116"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676004","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":142,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676004","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BPC permutation","cube connected SIMD computer","complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BPC permutation","cube connected SIMD computer","complexity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1982.1676004","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35214/01676004.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"338","endPage":"341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1982.1676004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal BPC Permutations on a Cube Connected SIMD Computer","abstract":"In this correspondence we develop an algorithm to perform BPC permutations on a cube connected SIMD computer.

This method, called \"Recomputing with Shifted Operands\" (RESO), can detect errors in both the arithmetic and logic operations. RESO uses the principle of time redundancy in detecting the errors and achieves its error detection capability through the use of the already existing replicated hardware in the form of identical bit slices. It is shown that for most practical ALU implementations, including the carry-lookahead adders, the RESO technique will detect all errors caused by faults in a bit-slice or a specific subcircuit of the bit slice. The fault model used is more general than the commonly assumed stuck-at fault model. Our fault model assumes that the faults are confined to a small area of the circuit and that the precise nature of the faults is not known.

In this paper we examine the feasibility of closed-form solutions of performability when Y is continuous.

The basic assumption made is that system sensitivity to hardware transient errors is a function of critical resources usage. The failure rate of a given resource is approximated by a deterministic function of time, depending on the average workload of that resource, plus a Gaussian process. The probability density function of the time to failure obtained under this assumption has a decreasing hazard function, explaining why decreasing hazard function densities such as the Weibull fit experimental data so well. Data on transient errors obtained from several systems are analyzed. Statistical tests confirm the good fit between decreasing hazard distributions and actual data. Finally, models of common fault-tolerant redundant structures are developed using decreasing hazard function distributions. The analysis indicates significant differences between reliability predictions based on the exponential distribution and those based on decreasing hazard function distributions. Reliability differences of 0.2 and factors greater than 2 in Mission Time Improvement are seen in model results. System designers should be aware of these differences.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1982.1676063","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35217/01676063.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1982.1676063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"658","endPage":"671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Derivation and Calibration of a Transient Error Reliability Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1982","displayDocTitle":"Derivation and Calibration of a Transient Error Reliability Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676063/","volume":"C-31","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1982","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Derivation and Calibration of a Transient Error Reliability Model","sourcePdf":"01676063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036594S","chronDate":"July  1982","isNumber":"35217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"117","articleId":"1676063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1676066,"authors":[{"name":"Lu","affiliation":["Center for Reliable Computing, Computer Systems Laboratory,Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Lu","id":"38039362400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676066","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":110,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":275},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Control flow","error detection","Pascal","structural integrity checking (SIC)","structured programming","watchdog processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control flow","error detection","Pascal","structural integrity checking (SIC)","structured programming","watchdog processor"]}],"abstract":"The use of watchdog processors in the implementation of Structural Integrity Checking (SIC) is described.

Several techniques for \"squaring\"-up rectangular grids are presented; sample values for the parameter-pair \u3008E, D\u3009 are: \u3008E = 1.2, D = 15\u3009, \u3008E = 1.45, D = 9\u3009, \u3008E = 1.8, D = 3\u3009. Note that these values of E and D hold for all rectangular grids, independent of number of vertices. The quest for these results was motivated by the question of whether or not one could automatically \"square up\" circuit layouts having aspect ratios very far from unity, without compromising the efficiency of the layout (in terms of area and length of the longest run of wire). The results reported here yield an affirmative answer to this question, at least in an idealized setting. One corollary of the embeddings presented here is that the side-2n\u00bd square \"king's-move\" grid contains as a subgraph every n-vertex rectangular grid. Another way to think of this result is that this embellished grid can be \"programmed\" or \"personalized,\" by setting switches, to represent any n-vertex rectangular grid.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1982.1676109","startPage":"907","endPage":"913","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35219/01676109.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1982.1676109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Embedding Rectangular Grids in Square Grids","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bounding aspect ratios of layouts","embedding graphs in grids","generic graphs","graph embeddings","theory of VLSI layouts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bounding aspect ratios of layouts","embedding graphs in grids","generic graphs","graph embeddings","theory of VLSI layouts"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1982","displayDocTitle":"On Embedding Rectangular Grids in Square Grids","volume":"C-31","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Embedding Rectangular Grids in Square Grids","sourcePdf":"01676109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033049S","chronDate":"Sept.  1982","isNumber":"35219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"72","articleId":"1676109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1676110,"authors":[{"name":"Molloy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, School of Natural Sciences, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Molloy","id":"37266789800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676110","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":702,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1421},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676110","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Alternating bit protocol","Markovian systems","performance analysis","Petri nets","Petri nets with time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating bit protocol","Markovian systems","performance analysis","Petri nets","Petri nets with time"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1982.1676110","endPage":"917","startPage":"913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35219/01676110.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1982.1676110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis Using Stochastic Petri Nets","abstract":"An isomorphism between the behavior of Petri nets with exponentially distributed transition rates and Markov processes is presented.

The convolver performs indirect convolution by using the cyclic convolution property of a class of generalized discrete Fourier transforms (DFT's) defined over rings isomorphic to direct sums of Galois fields. The paper first presents the theoretical development of the computational element required for computing the generalized discrete Fourier transform (GDFIT) and its inverse. The theory extends the use of base fields to second degree extension fields and provides efficient choices for transform parameters to minimize hardware. The paper next presents results of recent work in multidimensional transform memory structures, and extends this work to the complete convolution process. The two theories are then \"married\" to produce efficient, very high speed convolution architectures. Simulation results are presented for a second degree extension field image convolver and constructional details are presented for a fast image convolver using 2 base fields and designed to operate as a peripheral to a fast 32 bit minicomputer.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1983.1676150","startPage":"989","endPage":"1001","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35222/01676150.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1983.1676150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processor Architectures for Two-Dimensional Convolvers Using a Single Multiplexed Computational Element with Finite Field Arithmetic","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Finite fields and rings","generalized DFT's","image processing","look-up table implementation","number theoretic transforms","processor architecture","residue number system","two-dimensional convolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite fields and rings","generalized DFT's","image processing","look-up table implementation","number theoretic transforms","processor architecture","residue number system","two-dimensional convolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Processor Architectures for Two-Dimensional Convolvers Using a Single Multiplexed Computational Element with Finite Field Arithmetic","volume":"C-32","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processor Architectures for Two-Dimensional Convolvers Using a Single Multiplexed Computational Element with Finite Field Arithmetic","sourcePdf":"01676150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051864S","chronDate":"Nov.  1983","isNumber":"35222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","articleId":"1676150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1676155,"authors":[{"name":"Thompson","affiliation":["Division of Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Thompson","id":"37958693500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676155","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":131,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":342},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Algorithms implemented in hardware","area-time complexity","computational complexity","FFT","Fourier transform","mesh-connected computers","parallel algorithms","shuffle-exchange network","VLSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms implemented in hardware","area-time complexity","computational complexity","FFT","Fourier transform","mesh-connected computers","parallel algorithms","shuffle-exchange network","VLSI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676155","abstract":"This paper surveys nine designs for VLSI circuits that compute N-element Fourier transforms.

RESO uses time redundancy for error detection and requires only a small increase in the hardware of a multiply and divide array.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1983.1676246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35226/01676246.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1983.1676246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent Error Detection in Multiply and Divide Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676246/","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent Error Detection in Multiply and Divide Arrays","volume":"C-32","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent Error Detection in Multiply and Divide Arrays","sourcePdf":"01676246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029527S","chronDate":"April  1983","isNumber":"35226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"44","articleId":"1676246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1676262,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

The new method uses only three levels of gates, and is based on the partitioning of the input lines into m blocks of two lines per block except for the last block. A first level of two-input AND and OR gates realizes the majority functions T(ki \u2265 1) and T(ki \u2265 2). These are combined through AND gates of a second level into the so-called product functions Pj1j2...jm, one for each class of input codewords that have jl, j2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, jm 1's in the corresponding blocks of the input lines. Finally, two OR gates (third level) partition the product functions into two. The property of totally self-checking operation is achieved through the proper partitioning of the product functions into two classes. This note presents a systematic method of such partitioning. Also, the note determines the cost of these checkers and compares them to previous designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676265/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1983","publicationDate":"May 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","volume":"C-32","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Efficient Totally Self-Checking Checkers for m-out-of-(2m \u00b1 1) Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Efficient Totally Self-Checking Checkers for m-out-of-(2m \u00b1 1) Codes","sourcePdf":"01676265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048584S","chronDate":"May  1983","isNumber":"35227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1676265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1676273,"authors":[{"name":"Bushard","affiliation":["Sperry Univac, Roseville, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Bushard","id":"37087694412"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676273","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":30},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676273","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Digital arithmetic","digital division","inequalities","logic design","minimum table size","n-bit fraction","nonrestoring division","normalized","radix 2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital arithmetic","digital division","inequalities","logic design","minimum table size","n-bit fraction","nonrestoring division","normalized","radix 2"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1983.1676273","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35228/01676273.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"521","endPage":"526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1983.1676273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Minimum Table Size Result for Higher Radix Nonrestoring Division","abstract":"The minimum table size is established for nonrestoring division algorithms that utilize a table lookup technique for quotient digit selection.

Both networks are suitable for VISI implementation and have been analyzed using Thompson's model of VLSI. While the OTN and OTC have time performances similar to fast networks such as the perfect shuffle network (PSN), the cube comnected cycles (CCC), etc., they have substantially better area * time2 performances for a number of matrix and graph problems. For instance, the connected components and a minimal spanning tree of an undirected N-vertex graph can be found in 0(log4 N) time on the OTC with an area * time2 performance of 0(N2 log8 N) and 0(N2 log9 N) respectively. This is asymptoticaly much better than the performances of the CCC, PSN and Mesh. The OTC and OTN can be looked upon as general purpose parallel processors since a number of other problems such as sorting and DFT can be solved on them with an area * time2 performance matching that of other networks. Finally, programming the OTN and OTC is simple and they are also amenable to pipelining a series of problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35228/01676279.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1983.1676279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1983.1676279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient VLSI Networks for Parallel Processing Based on Orthogonal Trees","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Area-time complexity","interconnection networks","matrix multiplication","orthogonal trees networks","parallel algorithms","parallel processing","sorting","VLSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Area-time complexity","interconnection networks","matrix multiplication","orthogonal trees networks","parallel algorithms","parallel processing","sorting","VLSI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1983","displayDocTitle":"Efficient VLSI Networks for Parallel Processing Based on Orthogonal Trees","volume":"C-32","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1983","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient VLSI Networks for Parallel Processing Based on Orthogonal Trees","sourcePdf":"01676279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084545S","chronDate":"June  1983","isNumber":"35228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"84","articleId":"1676279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676293,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Long Chen","affiliation":["IBM, Corporation, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Chin-Long Chen","id":"37336913400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676293","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":190},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676293","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Computer memory systems","error-correcting codes","reliability","single error-correcting-double error-detecting-single byte error-detecting codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer memory systems","error-correcting codes","reliability","single error-correcting-double error-detecting-single byte error-detecting codes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1983.1676293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35229/01676293.pdf","startPage":"615","endPage":"621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1983.1676293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-Correcting Codes with Byte Error-Detection Capability","abstract":"Single error-correcting and double error-detecting codes capable of detecting all single byte errors are important for practical applications.

To pack N rectangles into an infinite vertical strip of fixed width, the strategy considered here places each rectangle in turn as low as possible in the strip in a left-justified position. For reasons of simplicity and good performance, the bottom-left heuristic has long been a favorite in practical applications; however, the best implementations found so far require a number of steps O(N3). In this paper, we present an implementation of the bottom-left heuristic which requires linear space and quadratic time. The algorithm is fairly practical, and we believe that even for relatively small values of N, it gives the most efficient implementation of the heuristic, to date. It proceeds by first determining all the possible locations where the next rectangle can fit, then selecting the lowest of them. It is optimal among all the algorithms based on this exhaustive strategy, and its generality makes it adaptable to different packing heuristics.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1983.1676307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35230/01676307.pdf","startPage":"697","endPage":"707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1983.1676307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Bottomn-Left Bin-Packing Heuristic: An Efficient Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676307/","displayDocTitle":"The Bottomn-Left Bin-Packing Heuristic: An Efficient Implementation","volume":"C-32","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Bottomn-Left Bin-Packing Heuristic: An Efficient Implementation","sourcePdf":"01676307.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03055S","chronDate":"Aug.  1983","isNumber":"35230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"197","articleId":"1676307","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1676309,"authors":[{"name":"Tasaka","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"lastName":"Tasaka","id":"37268407800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676309","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":94,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Broadcast systems","channel propagation delay","equilibrium point analysis","multidimensional Markov chain","packet communication","performance analysis","R-ALOHA","satellite channel","stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast systems","channel propagation delay","equilibrium point analysis","multidimensional Markov chain","packet communication","performance analysis","R-ALOHA","satellite channel","stability"]}],"abstract":"The dynamic behavior of the R-ALOHA packet broadcast system with multipacket messages is analyzed in this paper. It is assumed that each user handles one message at a time and the number of packets in a message is geometrically distributed. A Markovian model of the system is first formulated which explicitly contains the influence of the propagation delay of the broadcast channel. An approximate technique called equilibrium point analysis (EPA) is utilized to analyze the multidimensional Markov chain. The system stability behavior and the throughput-average message delay performance are demonstrated by the EPA. Numerical results from both analysis and simulation are given to assess the accuracy of the analytic results.

Logic design of multiple-valued circuits is considerably more complex than binary design because of the associated combinatorial explosion. Two general approaches which can be taken in axiomatizing the environment of combinational logic design in multiple-valued logic have been investigated. These axiomatizations, formulated in the language of first order logic, are used to state the problem of combinational logic design as a theorem proving problem. This formulation together with a representation of the function being designed can be used as input to an automatic theorem proving program. The circuit design can then be obtained from the proof generated by the theorem prover.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1983","publicationDate":"Sept. 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","volume":"C-32","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automated Design of Multiple-Valued Logic Circuits by Automatic Theorem Proving Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Design of Multiple-Valued Logic Circuits by Automatic Theorem Proving Techniques","sourcePdf":"01676328.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032994S","chronDate":"Sept.  1983","isNumber":"35231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"12","articleId":"1676328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1676330,"authors":[{"name":"Schwab","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Naperville, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Schwab","id":"38051877400"},{"name":"Yau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Yau","id":"38037645500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676330","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":50},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676330","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean vector algebra","error correction","fault-tolerant VLSI","fault-masking logic circuits","redundancy","reliability","syndrome function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boolean vector algebra","error correction","fault-tolerant VLSI","fault-masking logic circuits","redundancy","reliability","syndrome function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1983.1676330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35231/01676330.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1983.1676330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algebraic Model of Fault-Masking Logic Circuits","abstract":"In this paper, an algebraic model of fault-masking logic (FML) circuits, assuming bitwise logical operations and a separate single-valued coding system is presented. From this model, the neccessary and sufficient conditions to construct FML circuits are derived, and the error-propagating and error-correcting characteristics of such FML circuits are defined in terms of a Boolean vector algebra and a syndrome-like function. The capabilities and limitations of FML circuits are characterized and several constructive techniques are explored. Optimum FML constructions are developed for correcting a maximum number of faults in a minimum number of logic levels for simple logic structures. For complex logic structures, these constructions apply but it is not known if they are optimum. In addition, the enhancement of FML circuits with fault-detecting capabilities is developed in the event that the error-correcting capabilities of FML circuits should be exceeded.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1983","volume":"C-32","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Algebraic Model of Fault-Masking Logic Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algebraic Model of Fault-Masking Logic Circuits","sourcePdf":"01676330.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059957S","chronDate":"Sept.  1983","isNumber":"35231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1676330","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676331,"authors":[{"name":"Stout","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Stout","id":"37087849598"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676331","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":113,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Broadcasting","mesh-connected computer","parallel computing","selection","semigroup computations","sorting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcasting","mesh-connected computer","parallel computing","selection","semigroup computations","sorting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676331","abstract":"We consider the effects of augmenting an arbitrary mesh-connected computer with a second communication system called broadcasting.

Various ring systems and CSMA contention bus systems have been in operation for several years. More recently, a number of distributed demand assignment multiple access (DAMA) schemes suitable for broadcast bus networks have emerged which provide conflict-free broadcast communications by means of various scheduling techniques. Among these schemes, the Token-Passing Bus Access method uses explicit tokens, i.e., control messages, to provide the required scheduling. Others use implicit tokens, whereby stations in the network rely on information deduced from the activity on the bus to schedule their transmissions.

Techniques used in VLSI complexity theory are also brought in, and algorithm-independent upper bounds on system performance are derived for several problems that are important to scientific computation.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Interconnection networks","numerical software","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures","VLSI complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interconnection networks","numerical software","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures","VLSI complexity"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.1676393","startPage":"1180","endPage":"1194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35234/01676393.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TC.1984.1676393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Impact of Communication Complexity on the Design of Parallel Numerical Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1984","displayDocTitle":"On the Impact of Communication Complexity on the Design of Parallel Numerical Algorithms","publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","volume":"C-33","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Impact of Communication Complexity on the Design of Parallel Numerical Algorithms","sourcePdf":"01676393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040916S","chronDate":"Dec.  1984","isNumber":"35234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"68","articleId":"1676393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1676395,"authors":[{"name":"Hennessy","affiliation":["Computer Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hennessy","id":"37338120700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676395","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":695},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Processor Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Computer organization","instruction issue","instruction set design","memory mapping","microprocessors","pipelining","processor architecture","processor implementation","VLSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer organization","instruction issue","instruction set design","memory mapping","microprocessors","pipelining","processor architecture","processor implementation","VLSI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676395","abstract":"A processor architecture attempts to compromise between the needs of programs hosted on the architecture and the performance attainable in implementing the architecture. The needs of programs are most accurately reflected by the dynamic use of the instruction set as the target for a high level language compiler. In VLSI, the issue of implementation of an instruction set architecture is significant in determining the features of the architecture. Recent processor architectures have focused on two major trends: large microcoded instruction sets and simplified, or reduced, instruction sets. The attractiveness of these two approaches is affected by the choice of a single-chip implementation. The two different styles require different tradeoffs to attain an implementation in silicon with a reasonable area. The two styles consume the chip area for different purposes, thus achieving performance by different strategies. In a VLSI implementation of an architecture, many problems can arise from the base technology and its limitations. Although circuit design techniques can help alleviate many of these problems, the architects must be aware of these limitations and understand their implications at the instruction set level.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1984.1676395","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35234/01676395.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.1676395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Processor Architecture","volume":"C-33","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Processor Architecture","sourcePdf":"01676395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114845S","chronDate":"Dec.  1984","isNumber":"35234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"132","articleId":"1676395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676396,"authors":[{"name":"Seitz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Seitz","id":"38180978900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676396","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":155,"citationCountPatent":34,"totalDownloads":206},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Computational arrays","concurrent computation","logic-enhanced memories","microcomputer arrays","multiprocessors","parallel processing","smart memories","systolic arrays","VLSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational arrays","concurrent computation","logic-enhanced memories","microcomputer arrays","multiprocessors","parallel processing","smart memories","systolic arrays","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"This tutorial paper addresses some of the principles and provides examples of concurrent architectures and designs that have been inspired by VLSI technology. The circuit density offered by VLSI provides the means for implementing systems with very large numbers of computing elements, while its physical characteristics provide an incentive to organize systems so that the elements are relatively loosely coupled. One class of computer architectures that evolve from this reasoning include an interesting and varied class of concurrent machines that adhere to a structural model based on the repetition of regularly connected elements. The systems included under this structural model range from 1) systems that combine storage and logic at a fine grain size, and are typically aimed at computations with images or storage retrieval, to 2) systems that combine registers and arithmetic at a medium grain size to form computational or systolic arrays for signal processing and matrix computations, to 3) arrays of instruction interpreting computers that use teamwork to perform many of the same demanding computations for which we use high-performance single process computers today.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35234/01676396.pdf","startPage":"1247","endPage":"1265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent VLSI Architectures","doi":"10.1109/TC.1984.1676396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.1676396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676396/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent VLSI Architectures","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"C-33","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent VLSI Architectures","sourcePdf":"01676396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070882S","chronDate":"Dec.  1984","isNumber":"35234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"155","articleId":"1676396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676405,"authors":[{"name":"Bokhari","affiliation":["Institute for Computer Applications in Science and Engineering (ICASE), NASA-Langley Research Center, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan"],"lastName":"Bokhari","id":"37087359005"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676405","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":71},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676405","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Array processors","global bus","interconnection structures","maximum","networks","parallel processing","two-phase algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array processors","global bus","interconnection structures","maximum","networks","parallel processing","two-phase algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1984.1676405","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35235/01676405.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"133","endPage":"139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.1676405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding Maximum on an Array Processor with a Global Bus","abstract":"The problem of finding the maximum of a set of values stored one per processor on an n X n array of processors is analyzed.

In this model a network consists of a set of nodes connected by transistor \"switches\" with each node having a state 0, 1, or X (for invalid or uninitialized), and each transistor having a state \"open,\" \"closed,\" or \"indeterminate.\" Many characteristics of MOS circuits can be modeled accurately, including: ratioed, complementary, and precharged logic; dynamic and static storage; (bidirectional) pass transistors; buses; charge sharing; and sneak paths. In this paper we present a formal development of the switch-level model starting from a description of circuit behavior in terms of switch graphs. Then we describe an algorithm for a logic simulator based on the switch-level model which computes the new state of the network by solving a set of equations in a simple, discrete algebra. This algorithm has been implemented in the simulator MOSSIM II and operates at speeds approaching those of conventional logic gate simulators. By developing a formal theory of MOS logic circuits, we have achieved a greater degree of generality and accuracy than is found in other logic simulators for MOS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Switch-Level Model and Simulator for MOS Digital Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1984.1676408","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35235/01676408.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.1676408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676408/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1984","displayDocTitle":"A Switch-Level Model and Simulator for MOS Digital Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-33","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Switch-Level Model and Simulator for MOS Digital Systems","sourcePdf":"01676408.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030935S","chronDate":"Feb.  1984","isNumber":"35235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"268","articleId":"1676408","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1676409,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang Yung Liu","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuang Yung Liu","id":"37069608800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676409","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":18,"totalDownloads":197},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH decoders","error-correcting codes","finite field processors","parallel processing","pipeline processing","Reed\u2013Solomon decoders","VLSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BCH decoders","error-correcting codes","finite field processors","parallel processing","pipeline processing","Reed\u2013Solomon decoders","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the known decoding procedures for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are modified to obtain a repetitive and recursive decoding technique which is suitable for VLSI implementation and pipelining.

In the most powerful design, all the 256K bits are organized so that they form a codeword in a double-error-correcting triple-error-detecting code derived from a projective plane. Because all of the bits are components of this single codeword, the coding efficiency is very high; the required parity check bits increase the storage by only 3 percent, approximately. Single error correction can take place at the time of a read with very little additional delay compared to that of a normal irredundant memory. Multiple error correction can be performed by the memory management system. A variety of failure modes, including failure of a whole column of one of the constituent 64 x 64 subarrays can be tolerated.

The performance of such a structure is compared to that of other existing hypercube structures such as Boolean n-cube and nearest neighbor mesh computers.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1984.1676437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35237/01676437.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.1676437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35237","startPage":"323","endPage":"333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Hypercube and Hyperbus Structures for a Computer Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Hypercube and Hyperbus Structures for a Computer Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676437/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1984","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-33","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1984","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Hypercube and Hyperbus Structures for a Computer Network","sourcePdf":"01676437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037968S","chronDate":"April  1984","isNumber":"35237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"608","articleId":"1676437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":1676441,"authors":[{"name":"Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yeh","id":"37876743400"},{"name":"Reed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Reed","id":"37271039600"},{"name":"Truong","affiliation":["Communication Systems Research Section, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Truong","id":"37286544300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676441","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":156,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":339},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676441","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Finite field","logic design","primitive element","systolic array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite field","logic design","primitive element","systolic array"]}],"abstract":"Two systolic architectures are developed for performing the product\u2013sum computation AB + C in the finite field GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n) of 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\nelements, where A, B, and C are arbitrary elements of GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n).

(A hypergraph is a graph in which one edge may connect two or more vertices.) The hypergraph is represented by a collection of points in graph space such that the distance between vertices in graph space reflects the weights of the edges between vertices of the original hypergraph. Vertices of the hypergraph that are connected by edges with large weights are mapped to nearby points in graph space. Thus, graph space reveals properties of the connectivity of vertices in the hypergraph. A natural application of graph space is the placement of modules in computer systems since strongly coupled modules are transformed into nearby points in graph space. The graph of the airlines network in the United States is taken as an example of a hypergraph, and the paper illustrates the corresponding graph space.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1984.1676443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35237/01676443.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.1676443","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Representation of Hypergraphs in the Euclidean Space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1984","displayDocTitle":"A Representation of Hypergraphs in the Euclidean Space","volume":"C-33","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Representation of Hypergraphs in the Euclidean Space","sourcePdf":"01676443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035787S","chronDate":"April  1984","isNumber":"35237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"12","articleId":"1676443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676453,"authors":[{"name":"Wah","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Wah","id":"37086985827"},{"name":"Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Ma","id":"37087617104"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676453","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":44},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676453","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Approximate branch-and-bound","NP-hard problems","parallel branch-and-bound","ring network","selection","vertex-covering problem","virtual memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate branch-and-bound","NP-hard problems","parallel branch-and-bound","ring network","selection","vertex-covering problem","virtual memory"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose and analyze the design of MANIP, a parallel machine for processing nondeterministic polynomial (NP)-hard problems.

We have adapted and extended branch-and-bound algorithms for parallel processing. The parallel branch-and-bound algorithmn requires a combination of sorting and merging that will be too inefficient to perform in a common memory. We have proposed a system with distributed intelligence so that sorting can be carried out efticiently.

This gives rise to a systematic procedure to generate tests which is independent of the microprocessor implementation details.

In addition to achieving high performance, high reliability is also important to ensure that the results of long computations are valid. This paper proposes a novel system-level method of achieving high reliability, called algorithm-based fault tolerance. The technique encodes data at a high level, and algorithms are designed to operate on encoded data and produce encoded output data. The computation tasks within an algorithm are appropriately distributed among multiple computation units for fault tolerance. The technique is applied to matrix compomations which form the heart of many computation-intensive tasks. Algorithm-based fault tolerance schemes are proposed to detect and correct errors when matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, scalar product, LU-decomposition, and transposition are performed using multiple processor systems. The method proposed can detect and correct any failure within a single processor in a multiple processor system. The number of processors needed to just detect errors in matrix multiplication is also studied.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676475/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1984","volume":"C-33","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"June 1984","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance for Matrix Operations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance for Matrix Operations","sourcePdf":"01676475.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072749S","chronDate":"June  1984","isNumber":"35239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"784","articleId":"1676475","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1676477,"authors":[{"name":"McCluskey","affiliation":["Center for Reliable Computing, Computer Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"McCluskey","id":"37273983300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676477","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":169,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":190},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"A new approach to test pattern generation which is particularly suitable for self-test is described.

They also have a property which appears to make them attractive to the security minded, namely they do not permit bits to be rewritten. In other words, a 0 can be changed to a 1, but a 1 cannot be changed back to a 0. In a recent paper, however, Rivest and Shamir show that this does not prevent the changing of information; in fact, at relatively small additional cost (slightly longer codes), information can be changed as often as is desired. In the present paper we are concerned with issues in the integrity of data stored on digital optical disks or any other write-once storage medium, for that matter. A number of practically useful schemes are presented. In particular, immutable codes are discussed, both fixed length and variable length. These are codes which guarantee that information may not be changed. Also introduced are alternative schemes, such as control key schemes, which guarantee either unconditionally or with a certain probability that information cannot be changed if it is stored on digital optical disks. The main distinguishing feature of these schemes is the price to be paid for implementing them, i. e., the number of additional bits required for obtaining the desired protection against subversion.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35240/01676498.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TC.1984.1676498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.1676498","startPage":"818","endPage":"827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Integrty in Digital Optical Disks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676498/","displayDocTitle":"Data Integrty in Digital Optical Disks","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-33","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Integrty in Digital Optical Disks","sourcePdf":"01676498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032228S","chronDate":"Sept.  1984","isNumber":"35240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"41","articleId":"1676498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1676501,"authors":[{"name":"Tang","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Exhaustive pattern testing, with adequate partitioning of logic, has been explored regarding its potential in solving the problems in test pattern generation and fault coverage. In this paper, we propose a new method of simultaneously generating exhaustive test patterns for all possible input subsets (each corresponding to an output) up tq a specified size. The method is based on the structure of linear polynomial codes and can be easily implemented by modifying existing shift-registers in an LSSD or scan path design to embody additional feedback connections. This is particularly attractive since the implementation is compatible with the approach of self-testing using pseudorandom patterns. Thus, a very reasonable strategy is to combine limited exhaustive pattern testing with pseudorandom pattern testing ini cases where complete exhaustive testing is not practical.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logic Test Pattern Generation Using Linear Codes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1984.1676501","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35240/01676501.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1984.1676501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Logic Test Pattern Generation Using Linear Codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-33","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic Test Pattern Generation Using Linear Codes","sourcePdf":"01676501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054797S","chronDate":"Sept.  1984","isNumber":"35240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"66","articleId":"1676501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1676516,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Jie Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Guo-Jie Li","id":"37066555200"},{"name":"Wah","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Wah","id":"37267152500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676516","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":158,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Data distribution","data flow","parameter method","period","recurrence equation","systolic array","velocity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data distribution","data flow","parameter method","period","recurrence equation","systolic array","velocity"]}],"abstract":"Conventional design of systolic arrays is based on the mapping of an algorithm onto an interconnection of processing elements in a VLSI chip.

In this paper, systolic arrays are characterized by three classes of parameters: the velocities of data flows, the spatial distributions of data, and the periods of computation. By relating these parameters in constraint equations that govern the correctness of the design, the design is formulated into an optimization problem. The size of the search space is a polynomial of the problem size, and a methodology to systematically search and reduce this space and to obtain the optimal design is proposed.

Rubin [6] has shown that it is computationally feasible to solve a cipher proposed by Pless [2] in a known plaintext attack, using as few as 15 characters. Here, the number of ciphertext symbols is determined to perform a ciphertext-only attack on the Pless cipher using the correlation attack. Our conclusion from the analysis is that the pseudonoise generator's output sequence and the sequences generated by the linear feedback shift registers should be uncorrelated.

A cost function defined in terms of a single unit, time, is proposed for evaluating the effectiveness of task assignment. This cost function represents the maximum time for a task to complete module execution and communication in all the processors. A new optimization criterion, called the minimax criterion, is also proposed, based on which both minimization of interprocessor communication and balance of processor loading can be achieved. The proposed approach allows various system constraints to be included for consideration. With the proposed cost function and the minimax criterion, optimal task assignment is defined. Graphs are then used to represent the module relationship of a given task and the processor structure of a distributed computing system. Module assignment to system processors is transformed into a type of graph matching, called weak homomorphism. The search of optimal weak homomorphism corresponding to optimal task assignment is next formulated as a state-space search problem. It is then solved by the well-known A* algorithm in artificial intelligence after proper heuristic information for speeding up the search is suggested. An illustrative example and some experimental results are also included to show the effectiveness of the heuristic search.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.1676563","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35244/01676563.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.1676563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"197","endPage":"203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Graph Matching Approach to Optimal Task Assignment in Distributed Computing Systems Using a Minimax Criterion","volume":"C-34","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Graph Matching Approach to Optimal Task Assignment in Distributed Computing Systems Using a Minimax Criterion","sourcePdf":"01676563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05262S","chronDate":"March  1985","isNumber":"35244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"221","articleId":"1676563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676564,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Terng Wang","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Yung-Terng Wang","id":"38046381800"},{"name":"Morris","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Morris","id":"37286568100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676564","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":254,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":1047},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Distributed scheduling","distributed systems","load sharing","performance analysis","queueing analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed scheduling","distributed systems","load sharing","performance analysis","queueing analysis"]}],"abstract":"An important part of a distributed system design is the choice of a load sharing or global scheduling strategy. A comprehensive literature survey on this topic is presented. We propose a taxonomy of load sharing algorithms that draws a basic dichotomy between source-initiative and server-initiative approaches. The taxonomy enables ten representative algorithms to be selected for performance evaluation. A performance metric called the Q-factor (quality of load sharing) is defined which summarizes both overall efficiency and fairness of an algorithm and allows algorithms to be ranked by performance. We then evaluate the algorithms using both mathematical and simulation techniques. The results of the study show that: i) the choice of load sharing algorithm is a critical design decision; ii) for the same level of scheduling information exchange, server-initiative has the potential of outperforming source-initiative algorithms (whether this potential is realized depends on factors such as communication overhead); iii) the Q-factor is a useful yardstick; iv) some algorithms, which have previously received little attention, e.g., multiserver cyclic service, may provide effective solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.1676564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35244/01676564.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.1676564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Sharing in Distributed Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676564/","displayDocTitle":"Load Sharing in Distributed Systems","volume":"C-34","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Sharing in Distributed Systems","sourcePdf":"01676564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061925S","chronDate":"March  1985","isNumber":"35244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"254","articleId":"1676564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676569,"authors":[{"name":"Imase","affiliation":["Musashino Electrical Communication Laboratory, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Imase","id":"37087647339"},{"name":"Soneoka","affiliation":["Musashino Electrical Communication Laboratory, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Soneoka","id":"37087766201"},{"name":"Okada","affiliation":["Musashino Electrical Communication Laboratory, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Okada","id":"37087766956"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676569","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":99,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676569","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Communication networks","connectivity maximization","diameter minimization","directed graphs","interconnection networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication networks","connectivity maximization","diameter minimization","directed graphs","interconnection networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.1676569","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35244/01676569.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"267","endPage":"273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.1676569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connectivity of Regular Directed Graphs with Small Diameters","abstract":"This paper clarifies the relation between the diameter k and the edge or node connectivity Ce or c,, of digraphs.

The new implementations are fast and simple mainly because adders modulo a large and arbitrary integer M are effectively replaced by binary adders and possibly a lookup table of small address space. Although different in form, both techniques share the same principle that an appropriate representation of the summands must be employed in order to evaluate a sum modulo M efficiently. The first technique reduces the sum modulo M in the conversion formula to a sum modulo 2 through the use of fractional representation, which also exposes the sign bit of numbers. Thus, this technique is particularly useful for sign detection and for any operation requiring a comparison with a binary fraction of M. The other technique is preferable for the full conversion from residues to unsigned or 2's complement integers. By expressing the summands in terms of quotients and remainders with respect to a properly chosen divisor, the second technique systematically replaces the sum modulo M by two binary sums, one accumulating the quotients modulo a power of 2 and the other accumulating the remainders the ordinary way. A final recombination step is required but is easily implemented with a small lookup table and binary adders.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.1676602","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35246/01676602.pdf","startPage":"646","endPage":"651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.1676602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Implementations of the Chinese Remainder Theorem for Sign Detection and Residue Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676602/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Implementations of the Chinese Remainder Theorem for Sign Detection and Residue Decoding","volume":"C-34","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Implementations of the Chinese Remainder Theorem for Sign Detection and Residue Decoding","sourcePdf":"01676602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035001S","chronDate":"July  1985","isNumber":"35246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"77","articleId":"1676602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676603,"authors":[{"name":"Lang","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik und Praktische Mathematik, Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"lastName":"Lang","id":"37089040145"},{"name":"Schimmler","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik und Praktische Mathematik, Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"lastName":"Schimmler","id":"37088056265"},{"name":"Schmeck","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik und Praktische Mathematik, Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"lastName":"Schmeck","id":"37088055840"},{"name":"Schroder","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Informatik und Praktische Mathematik, Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"lastName":"Schroder","id":"37088053949"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676603","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Odd-even-transposition sort","mesh-connected processor array","perfect shuffle","sorting","systolic array","VLSI algorithms","VLSI complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Odd-even-transposition sort","mesh-connected processor array","perfect shuffle","sorting","systolic array","VLSI algorithms","VLSI complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676603","abstract":"A parallel algorithm for sorting n data items in O(n) steps is presented.

The area and time complexities for a bit-serial and a bit-parallel version of this implementation are analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.1676603","startPage":"652","endPage":"658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.1676603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35246","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35246/01676603.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systolic Sorting on a Mesh-Connected Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676603/","displayDocTitle":"Systolic Sorting on a Mesh-Connected Network","volume":"C-34","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1985","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systolic Sorting on a Mesh-Connected Network","sourcePdf":"01676603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046074S","chronDate":"July  1985","isNumber":"35246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"48","articleId":"1676603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1676604,"authors":[{"name":"Abramovici","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Naperville, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Abramovici","id":"37087571847"},{"name":"Menon","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Naperville, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Menon","id":"37087624169"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676604","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":115},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676604","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bridging faults","fault detection","fault simulation","test generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bridging faults","fault detection","fault simulation","test generation"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence we prepent a practical approach to fault simulation and test generation for bridging faults in combinational circuits.

Multiplication of two n bit unsigned numbers requires 2n clock cycles to complete the process out of which n clocks are used for n-row carry-save additions, and the other n clocks are utilized only to propagate the remaining carries. This CSAS structure is modified so that it operates as a CSAS unit for the first n clocks and reconfigures itself as an n bit ripple-carry parallel adder at the (n + 1)st clock, thus allowing the carries to ripple through, eliminating the delay due to storage elements during the last n clocks. It is shown that this modification results in an about one-third increase in speed for an approximately one-third increase in hardware. The technique is extended to signed numbers represented in 2's complement form. Also, it is shown how these implementations can be modularized.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.1676620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.1676620","startPage":"741","endPage":"744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35247/01676620.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Serial-Parallel Binary Multiplier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1985","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Serial-Parallel Binary Multiplier","volume":"C-34","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Aug. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Serial-Parallel Binary Multiplier","sourcePdf":"01676620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105698S","chronDate":"Aug.  1985","isNumber":"35247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"33","articleId":"1676620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1676624,"authors":[{"name":"Gaitanis","affiliation":["Department of Computers, NRC Demokritos, Athens, Greece"],"lastName":"Gaitanis","id":"37063095800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676624","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676624","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Error indicator","fail safe","TSC checker"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error indicator","fail safe","TSC checker"]}],"abstract":"This correspondence presents a totally self-checking error indicator for solving the practical problem of monitoring the TSC checkers.

The underlying graph (to be called Shift and Replace graph or SRG) is based on DeBruijn digraphs and is a function of two parameters r and m. Pradhan and Reddy have shown that the node-connectivity of SRG is at least r. The same authors give a routing algorithm which generally requires 2m hops if the number of node failures is \u2264(r -1). In this paper we show that the node-connectivity of SRG is (2r - 2). This would immediately imply that the system can tolerate up to (2r - 3) node failures. We then present routing methods for situations with a certain number of node failures. When this number is \u2264(r - 2) our routing algorithm requires at most m + 3 + logr m hops if 3 + logr m \u2264m. When the number of node failures is \u2264(2r - 3) our routing algorithm requires at most m + 5 + logr m hops if 4 + logr m \u2264 m. In all the other situations our routing algorithm requires no more than 2m hops. The routing algorithms are shown to be computationally efficient.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35248/01676633.pdf","startPage":"777","endPage":"788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.1676633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.1676633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Routing in DeBruijn Comrnunication Networks","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Computer networks","connectivity of DeBruijn networks","fault-tolerant routing","multiple processor systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer networks","connectivity of DeBruijn networks","fault-tolerant routing","multiple processor systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Routing in DeBruijn Comrnunication Networks","volume":"C-34","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-Tolerant Routing in DeBruijn Comrnunication Networks","sourcePdf":"01676633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081266S","chronDate":"Sept.  1985","isNumber":"35248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"102","articleId":"1676633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1676634,"authors":[{"name":"Takagi","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Takagi","id":"37281706600"},{"name":"Yasuura","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Yasuura","id":"37299568300"},{"name":"Yajima","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Yajima","id":"37319425100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676634","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":243,"citationCountPatent":23,"totalDownloads":1413},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed VLSI Multiplication Algorithm with a Redundant Binary Addition Tree","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676634","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Arithmetic operations","binary integer multiplication","carry-propagation-free adder","hardware algorithm","high-speed multiplier","redundant binary representation","signed-digit number representation","VLSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arithmetic operations","binary integer multiplication","carry-propagation-free adder","hardware algorithm","high-speed multiplier","redundant binary representation","signed-digit number representation","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"A high-speed VLSI multiplication algorithm internally using redundant binary representation is proposed. In n bit binary integer multiplication, n partial products are first generated and then added up pairwise by means of a binary tree of redundant binary adders. Since parallel addition of two n-digit redundant binary numbers can be performed in a constant time independent of n without carry propagation, n bit multiplication can be performed in a time proportional to log2 n. The computation time is almost the same as that by a multiplier with a Wallace tree, in which three partial products will be converted into two, in contrast to our two-to-one conversion, and is much shorter than that by an array multiplier for longer operands. The number of computation elements of an n bit multiplier based on the algorithm is proportional to n2. It is almost the same as those of conventional ones. Furthermore, since the multiplier has a regular cellular array structure similar to an array multiplier, it is suitable for VLSI implementation. Thus, the multiplier is excellent in both computation speed and regularity in layout. It can be implemented on a VLSI chip with an area proportional to n2 log2 n. The algorithm can be directly applied to both unsigned and 2's complement binary integer multiplication.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.1676634","startPage":"789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35248/01676634.pdf","endPage":"796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.1676634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676634/","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed VLSI Multiplication Algorithm with a Redundant Binary Addition Tree","volume":"C-34","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed VLSI Multiplication Algorithm with a Redundant Binary Addition Tree","sourcePdf":"01676634.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044818S","chronDate":"Sept.  1985","isNumber":"35248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"243","articleId":"1676634","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676635,"authors":[{"name":"Mackinnon","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Mackinnon","id":"38052122400"},{"name":"Taylor","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Taylor","id":"38034463700"},{"name":"Meijer","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Information Science, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Meijer","id":"37445519000"},{"name":"Akl","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Information Science, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Akl","id":"37298435500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676635","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":149},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676635","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Access control","canonical assignment","cooperative attack","cryptographic key","hierarchy","key generation algorithm","partially ordered set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access control","canonical assignment","cooperative attack","cryptographic key","hierarchy","key generation algorithm","partially ordered set"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.1676635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35248/01676635.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.1676635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimal Algorithm for Assigning Cryptographic Keys to Control Access in a Hierarchy","abstract":"A cryptographic scheme for controlling access to information within a group of users organized in a hierarchy was proposed in [1].

Algorithm partitioning is essential when the size of a computational problem is larger than the size of the VLSI array intended for that problem. Computational models are introduced for systolic arrays and iterative algorithms. First, we discuss the mapping of algorithms into arbitrarily large size VLSI arrays. This mapping is based on the idea of algorithm transformations. Then, we present an approach to algorithm partitioning which is also based on algorithm transformations. Our approach to the partitioning problem is to divide the algorithm index set into bands and to map these bands into the processor space. The partitioning and mapping technique developed throughout the paper is summarized as a six step procedure. A computer program implementing this procedure was developed and some results obtained with this program are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676652/","volume":"C-35","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Partitioning and Mapping Algorithms into Fixed Size Systolic Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partitioning and Mapping Algorithms into Fixed Size Systolic Arrays","sourcePdf":"01676652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044065S","chronDate":"Jan.  1986","isNumber":"35249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"372","articleId":"1676652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676653,"authors":[{"name":"Vergis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Vergis","id":"37350629300"},{"name":"Steiglitz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Steiglitz","id":"37269271900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676653","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":28},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bilateral arrays","combinational cells","fault detection","linear growth","one-step testability","preset test sequences","quadratic growth","systolic array","testability conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilateral arrays","combinational cells","fault detection","linear growth","one-step testability","preset test sequences","quadratic growth","systolic array","testability conditions"]}],"abstract":"Two sets of conditions are derived that make one- dimensional bilateral arrays of combinational cells testable for single faulty cells.

The technique is called roving emulation and consists of an off-line snap shot type emulation or simulation of operating components in a system. Its primary application is in testing systems in the field where real-time fault detection is not required. The primary performance measure of this test schema is taken to be the expected value of the error latency, i.e., the time required to detect a fault once it first occurs. The primary results of this paper deal with deriving equations for the error latency. We present both a probabilistic and service-waiting model to analyze the expected error latency in a system tested via roving emulation. The effects of various controllable and uncontrollable system parameters on error latency are studied. Finally, the technique is applied to a system consisting of combinational logic modules, and numerical results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1986.1676695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35251/01676695.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1986.1676695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35251","startPage":"933","endPage":"939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Roving Emulation as a Fault Detection Mechanism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Roving Emulation as a Fault Detection Mechanism","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676695/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-35","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Roving Emulation as a Fault Detection Mechanism","sourcePdf":"01676695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045926S","chronDate":"Nov.  1986","isNumber":"35251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1676695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1676696,"authors":[{"name":"Kavi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science Engineering, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Kavi","id":"37295249100"},{"name":"Buckles","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science Engineering, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Buckles","id":"37266183000"},{"name":"Bhat","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Bhat","id":"37286762300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676696","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":803},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new model for parallel computations and parallel computer systems that is based on data flow principles is presented.

We present an efficient algorithm to determine the mean completion time and related performance measures for a task system: a set of tasks with precedence relationships in their execution sequence, such that the resulting graph is acyclic. A queueing network (QN) is used to model tasks executing on a single or multicomputer system. In the case of multicomputer systems, we take into account the delay due to interprocess communication. A straight- forward application of a QN solver to the problem is not possible due to variations in the state of the system (composition of tasks in execution). An accurate algorithm based on hierarchical decomposition is presented for solving task systems. At the higher level, the system behavior is specified by a Markov chain whose states correspond to the combination of tasks in execution. The state transition rate matrix for the Markov chain is triangular (since the task system graph was assumed to be acyclic), therefore it can be solved efficiently to compute the state probabilities and the task initiation/completion times. At the lower level, the transition rates among the states of the Markov chain are computed using a QN solver, which determines the throughput of the computer system for each system state. The model and the solution method can be used in performance evaluation of applications exhibiting concurrency in centralized/distributed systems where there are conflicting goals of load balancing and minimizing interprocess communication overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","volume":"C-35","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analytic Queueing Network Models for Parallel Processing of Task Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic Queueing Network Models for Parallel Processing of Task Systems","sourcePdf":"01676712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031305S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"35252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"75","articleId":"1676712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676718,"authors":[{"name":"Chen","affiliation":["IBM, Corporation, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Chen","id":"37087920635"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676718","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Linear feedback shift registers","self-test","test pattern generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear feedback shift registers","self-test","test pattern generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676718","abstract":"Linear feedback shift registers have been proposed to generate test patterns for the self-test of logic networks.

The detection and location of faults and errors concurrently with normal system operation can be achieved through the application of appropriate on-line checks on the results of the computations. This is the domain of algorithm-based fault tolerance, which deals with low-cost system-level fault-tolerance techniques to produce reliable computations in multiple processor systems, by tailoring the fault-tolerance techniques toward specific algorithms. This paper presents a graph-theoretic model for determining upper and lower bounds on the number of checks needed for achieving concurrent fault detection and location. The objective is to estimate ate the overhead in time and the number of processors required for such a scheme. Faults in processors, errors in the data, and checks on the data to detect and locate errors are represented as a tripartite graph. Bounds on the time and processor overhead are obtained by considering a series of subproblems. First, using some crude concepts for t-fault detection and t-fault location, bounds on the maximum size of the error patterns that can arise from such fault patterns are obtained. Using these results, bounds are derived on the number of checks required for error detection and location. Some numerical results are derived from a linear programming formulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"C-35","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1986","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Bounds on Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance in Multiple Processor Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounds on Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance in Multiple Processor Systems","sourcePdf":"01676762.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034475S","chronDate":"April  1986","isNumber":"35255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"58","articleId":"1676762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":1676764,"authors":[{"name":"Saxena","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Company, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Saxena","id":"37267131400"},{"name":"Robinson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Robinson","id":"37306973600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676764","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":42,"totalDownloads":65},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676764","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Built-in test","fault coverage","partitions","signature","syndrome","testing","VLSI test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Built-in test","fault coverage","partitions","signature","syndrome","testing","VLSI test"]}],"abstract":"A new test data reduction technique called accumulator compression testng (ACT) is proposed.

However, for general VLSI circuits the complexity of ACT may be a problem as an adder is necessary.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1986.1676764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35255/01676764.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1986.1676764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accumulator Compression Testing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676764/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1986","displayDocTitle":"Accumulator Compression Testing","volume":"C-35","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1986","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accumulator Compression Testing","sourcePdf":"01676764.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040731S","chronDate":"April  1986","isNumber":"35255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1676764","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1676767,"authors":[{"name":"Thijs Krol","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, JA, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Thijs","lastName":"Krol"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676767","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":50},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Fault tolerant systems","Circuit faults","Hardware","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Consistency","error-correcting codes","fault tolerance","hardware redundancy","masking","voting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consistency","error-correcting codes","fault tolerance","hardware redundancy","masking","voting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676767","abstract":"This paper describes a new fault-tolerant computer architecture based on a \"distributed implementation\" of a symbol- error correcting code.

One of the compact generators produces sequences which have the desired properties for built-in tests.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"C-35","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1986","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Pseudorandom Arrays for Built-In Tests","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudorandom Arrays for Built-In Tests","sourcePdf":"01676810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05414S","chronDate":"July  1986","isNumber":"35257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"37","articleId":"1676810","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676819,"authors":[{"name":"Bryant","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Bryant","id":"37269746100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676819","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5102,"citationCountPatent":150,"totalDownloads":5610},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676819","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","binary decision diagrams","logic design verification","symbolic manipulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boolean functions","binary decision diagrams","logic design verification","symbolic manipulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a new data structure for representing Boolean functions and an associated set of manipulation algorithms. Functions are represented by directed, acyclic graphs in a manner similar to the representations introduced by Lee [1] and Akers [2], but with further restrictions on the ordering of decision variables in the graph. Although a function requires, in the worst case, a graph of size exponential in the number of arguments, many of the functions encountered in typical applications have a more reasonable representation. Our algorithms have time complexity proportional to the sizes of the graphs being operated on, and hence are quite efficient as long as the graphs do not grow too large. We present experimental results from applying these algorithms to problems in logic design verification that demonstrate the practicality of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1986.1676819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1986.1676819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35258/01676819.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-Based Algorithms for Boolean Function Manipulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Graph-Based Algorithms for Boolean Function Manipulation","volume":"C-35","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1986","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676819/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-Based Algorithms for Boolean Function Manipulation","sourcePdf":"01676819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037006S","chronDate":"Aug.  1986","isNumber":"35258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"5102","articleId":"1676819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1676822,"authors":[{"name":"Nakamura","affiliation":["Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA"],"lastName":"Nakamura","id":"38039084700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676822","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":236},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Complexity","five-counter","iterative array","multiplication speed","parallel multiplication","partial-products"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complexity","five-counter","iterative array","multiplication speed","parallel multiplication","partial-products"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676822","abstract":"Algorithms for the parallel multiplication of two n- bit binary numbers by an iterative array of logic cells are discussed.

However, locality of reference is disturbed and the hit ratio decreases whenever a task switch occurs. This performance degradation can be minimized if \"locality of task switching,\" the tendency for a small set of favored tasks to be frequently executed, exists and the cache is organized in such a way that it can hold blocks (lines) of multiple tasks. Locality of task switching and locality of memory references in individual tasks exhibit overall locality of memory references at a system level. This paper addresses the following questions. Does locality of task switching really exist? How can it be modeled? Task switching in IBM operating system/virtual storage with multiple virtual storage (OS/VS2 MVS) was measured using event traces for three different workloads to show that locality of task switching actually exists in MVS. Two different models of task switching are proposed. These models can be incorporated into cache multitasking models to predict more accurately the misses in real computer systems. A key parameter of these models is the task execution interval; measurements of execution intervals for the workloads used in the paper are presented and discussed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1986.1676823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35258","startPage":"720","endPage":"731","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35258/01676823.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Empirical Study of Task Switching Locality in MVS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676823/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1986","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Empirical Study of Task Switching Locality in MVS","publicationDate":"Aug. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"C-35","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Empirical Study of Task Switching Locality in MVS","sourcePdf":"01676823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025969S","chronDate":"Aug.  1986","isNumber":"35258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1676823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1676826,"authors":[{"name":"Pal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"lastName":"Pal","id":"37286349300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676826","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algorithm for Optimal Logic Design Using Multiplexers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676826","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Characterizing parameters","computer-aided design","logic design","multiplexer realization","reduced functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Characterizing parameters","computer-aided design","logic design","multiplexer realization","reduced functions"]}],"abstract":"A set of characterizing parameters, called ratio parameters, has been used to formulate an efficient algorithm for realizing any given Boolean funetion with a single multiplexer of minimum size.

The conditibnal probability is used to avoid applying at each iteration the most time consuming step in reliability algorithms, which is making a set of events mutually exclusive. The algorithm has been implemented on a VAX 11/750 and can analyze fairly large networks with modest memory and time requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1987","volume":"C-36","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"SYREL: A Symbolic Reliability Algorithm Based on Path and Cutset Methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SYREL: A Symbolic Reliability Algorithm Based on Path and Cutset Methods","sourcePdf":"01676862.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060058S","chronDate":"Oct.  1987","isNumber":"35260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"90","articleId":"1676862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1676865,"authors":[{"name":"I-Chen wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"I-Chen wu","id":"38031713500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676865","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Countercurrent data flow pattern","five-level multiplexer","five-level recorder","modified Booth's Algorithm","systolic multilier","two's complement","VLSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Countercurrent data flow pattern","five-level multiplexer","five-level recorder","modified Booth's Algorithm","systolic multilier","two's complement","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"Based on the modified Booth's algorithm, a fast 1-D serial- parallel systolic multiplier is designed for multiplying two's complement numbers.

We use the track graph, a suitably defined grid-like structure, to obtain efficient solutions for both problems. The track graph consists of rectilinear tracks defined by the obstacles and the points for which shortest paths and a minimum spanning tree are sought. We use a growth process like Dijkstra's on the track graph to find shortest paths from any point in the set to all other points (the one-to-all shortest paths problem). For the one-to-all shortest paths problem for n points we derive an O(n min {log n, log e} + (e + k) log t) time algorithm, where e is the total number of edges of all obstacles, t is the number of extreme edges of all obstacles, and k is the number of intersections among obstacle tracks (all bounds are for the worst case). The MST for the points is constructed also in time O(n log n + (e + k) log t) by a hybrid method of searching for shortest paths while simultaneously constructing an MST. An interesting application of the MST algorithm is the approximation of Steiner trees in graphs.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.1676904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35262/01676904.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.1676904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35262","startPage":"321","endPage":"331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rectilinear Shortest Paths and Minimum Spanning Trees in the Presence of Rectilinear Obstacles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rectilinear Shortest Paths and Minimum Spanning Trees in the Presence of Rectilinear Obstacles","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1987","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rectilinear Shortest Paths and Minimum Spanning Trees in the Presence of Rectilinear Obstacles","sourcePdf":"01676904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072898S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"35262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"59","articleId":"1676904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1676905,"authors":[{"name":"Wagner","affiliation":["EDS VLSI Design Rules Control Department, IBM, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA","Center for Reliable Computing, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Wagner","id":"37356602200"},{"name":"Chin","affiliation":["Center for Reliable Computing, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chin","id":"38032452700"},{"name":"McCluskey","affiliation":["Center for Reliable Computing, Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"McCluskey","id":"37273983300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676905","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":131,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":280},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"Algorithmic test generation for high fault coverage is an expensive and time-consuming process.

Our results indicate that for algorithms where both the computation and the communication overhead can be fully decomposed among N processors, the speedup is a nondecreasing function of the level of granularity for arbitrary interconnection structure and allocation of subproblems to processors. For these algorithms, the speedup is an increasing function of the level of granularity provided that the interconnection bandwidth is greater than unity. If the bandwidth is equal to unity, then the speedup converges to the value equal to the ratio of processing time to communication time. For algorithms where the computation is decomposable but the communication overhead cannot be decomposed, the speedup is a nondecreasing function of the level of granularity for the best case bandwidth only. If the bandwidth is less than N, the speedup reaches its maximum and then decreases approaching zero as the level of granularity grows. For algorithms where the computation consists of parallel and serial sections of code and the communication overhead is fully decomposable, the speedup converges to a value inversely proportional to the fraction of time spent in the serial code even for the best case interconnection bandwidth.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676924/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","publicationDate":"April 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","volume":"C-36","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Effects of Problem Partitioning, Allocation, and Granularity on the Performance of Multiple-Processor Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effects of Problem Partitioning, Allocation, and Granularity on the Performance of Multiple-Processor Systems","sourcePdf":"01676924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038673S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"35263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"48","articleId":"1676924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1676925,"authors":[{"name":"Soo-Young Lee","affiliation":["Computer and Vision Research Center, College of Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Soo-Young Lee","id":"38046066900"},{"name":"Aggarwal","affiliation":["Computer and Vision Research Center, College of Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Aggarwal","id":"37267346400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676925","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":114,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":250},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mapping Strategy for Parallel Processing","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Actual distance","communication overhead","initial assignment","mapping","objective function","pairwise exchange","parallel processing","problem graph","system graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Actual distance","communication overhead","initial assignment","mapping","objective function","pairwise exchange","parallel processing","problem graph","system graph"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676925","abstract":"This paper presents a mapping strategy for parallel processing using an accurate characterization of the communication overhead. A set of objective functions is formulated to evaluate the optimality of mapping a problem graph onto a system graph. One of them is especially suitable for real-time applications of parallel processing. These objective functions are different from the conventional objective functions in that the edges in the problem graph are weighted and the actual distance rather than the nominal distance for the edges in the system graph is employed. This facilitates a more accurate quantification of the communication overhead. An efficient mapping scheme has been developed for the objective functions, where two levels of assignment optimization procedures are employed: initial assignment and pairwise exchange. The mapping scheme has been tested using the hypercube as a system graph.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.1676925","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35263/01676925.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.1676925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"433","endPage":"442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Mapping Strategy for Parallel Processing","volume":"C-36","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mapping Strategy for Parallel Processing","sourcePdf":"01676925.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046812S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"35263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"114","articleId":"1676925","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1676926,"authors":[{"name":"Herlihy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Herlihy","id":"37087283049"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676926","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"Atomic transactions are a widely accepted approach to implementing and reasoning about fault-tolerant distributed programs.

This technique is deadlock-free, and it is applicable to objects of arbitrary type.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Abstract data types","atomicity","concurrency control","fault tolerance","multiple versions","serializability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Abstract data types","atomicity","concurrency control","fault tolerance","multiple versions","serializability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.1676926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35263/01676926.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.1676926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending Multiversion Time-Stamping Protocols to Exploit Type Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extending Multiversion Time-Stamping Protocols to Exploit Type Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676926/","volume":"C-36","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending Multiversion Time-Stamping Protocols to Exploit Type Information","sourcePdf":"01676926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020935S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"35263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"20","articleId":"1676926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1676939,"authors":[{"name":"Dally","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Dally","id":"37282485100"},{"name":"Seitz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Seitz","id":"38180978900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676939","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1445,"citationCountPatent":107,"totalDownloads":2838},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Communication networks","concurrent computation","graph model","interconnection networks","message passing multiprocessors","parallel processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication networks","concurrent computation","graph model","interconnection networks","message passing multiprocessors","parallel processing"]}],"abstract":"A deadlock-free routing algorithm can be generated for arbitrary interconnection networks using the concept of virtual channels.

These two algorithms share exactly the same structural formulation; therefore, they lead to the same systolic array design. In this paper, we first present a general method for mapping algorithms to systolic arrays. Using this methodology, two new systolic designs for the Warshall-Floyd algorithm will be derived. The first one is a spiral array, which is easy to derive and can be further simplified to a hexagonal array. The other is an orthogonal systolic array which is optimal in terms of pipelining rate, block pipelining rate, and the number of input/output connections.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676945/","volume":"C-36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1987","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Systolic Design for the Transitive Closure and the Shortest Path Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Systolic Design for the Transitive Closure and the Shortest Path Problems","sourcePdf":"01676945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059918S","chronDate":"May  1987","isNumber":"35264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"83","articleId":"1676945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1676949,"authors":[{"name":"Piestrak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Piestrak","id":"37063137800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676949","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Berger code","concurrent error detection","fault detection","m-out-of-n code checkers","self-checking circuits","self-testing checkers","unidirectional errors","unordered codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Berger code","concurrent error detection","fault detection","m-out-of-n code checkers","self-checking circuits","self-testing checkers","unidirectional errors","unordered codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1676949","abstract":"The Berger codes are optimal separable codes that detect all undirectional errors.

We show that for the general execution trace, few specific delays can be considered in isolation; rather, the magnitude of any specific delay may depend on the relative proximity of other delays. This phenomenon can make the task of accurately characterizing a trace tape with simple statistics intractable. We present a set of trace reductions that facilitates this task by simplifying the corresponding data-dependency graph. The reductions operate on multiple data-dependency arcs and branches in conjunction; those arcs whose performance implications are redundant with respect to the dependency graph are identified, and eliminated from the graph. We show that the reduced graph can be accurately characterized by simple statistics. We use these statistics to show that as the length of a pipeline increases, the performance degradation due to data dependencies and branches increases monotonically. However, lengthening the pipeline may correspond to decreasing the cycle time of the pipeline. These two opposing effects are used in conjunction to derive an equation for optimal pipeline length for a given trace tape. The optimal pipeline length is shown to be characterized by n = \u221a\u03b3\u03b1 where \u03b3 is the ratio of overall circuit delay to latching overhead, and a is a function of the trace statistics that accounts for the delays induced by data dependencies and branches.","doi":"10.1109/TC.1987.1676981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1987.1676981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/35266/01676981.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of Branch and Data Dependencies in Programs for Evaluating Pipeline Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1676981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1987","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of Branch and Data Dependencies in Programs for Evaluating Pipeline Performance","volume":"C-36","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of Branch and Data Dependencies in Programs for Evaluating Pipeline Performance","sourcePdf":"01676981.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038067S","chronDate":"July  1987","isNumber":"35266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"32","articleId":"1676981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1676982,"authors":[{"name":"Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, North Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University, Greensboro, NC, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Kim","id":"38166700800"},{"name":"Alexander","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Alexander","id":"37281705000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1676982","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Digital signal processing chip","fast algorithm","image processing","multiprocessor system","parallel computer architecture","two-dimensional filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital signal processing chip","fast algorithm","image processing","multiprocessor system","parallel computer architecture","two-dimensional filters"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a generic computational primitive is developed for the implementation of any arbitrary order one-dimensional or two-dimensional FIR or IIR digital filter.

The circuit topology originates from the integration of a buck-boost power-factor-correction converter and a class-E electronic ballast. Only one active power switch is commonly used by both power stages to save the cost of active switches and control circuits. The active switch is controlled by pulse-width-modulation (PWM) at a fixed switching frequency and constant duty cycle. The electronic ballast can achieve nearly unity power factor by operating the buck-boost converter at discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). With carefully designed circuit parameters, the active power switch can be operated at zero-voltage switching, leading to a high circuit efficiency. A prototype circuit designed for a PL-27W compact fluorescent lamp is built and tested to verify the theoretical predictions. Satisfactory performance is obtained from the experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 April-5 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1677294/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9035819","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Single-Stage Single-Switch High-Power-Factor Electronic Ballast for Fluorescent Lamps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Stage Single-Switch High-Power-Factor Electronic Ballast for Fluorescent Lamps","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"01677294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053241S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11083","isNumber":"35275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11083","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"35275","articleId":"1677294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1677297,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Although many factors have kept Moore's law as an industry benchmark, it is the entry of foreign competition that seems to have played a critical role in maintaining the pace of Moore's law in the early VLSI transition. Many different kinds of chips used many competing logic families.

This work focuses on the recognition of activities that are characterized by a hand motion and an accompanying sound. Suitable activities can be found in assembly and maintenance work. Here, we provide an initial exploration into the problem domain of continuous activity recognition using on-body sensing. We use a mock \"wood workshop\" assembly task to ground our investigation. We describe a method for the continuous recognition of activities (sawing, hammering, filing, drilling, grinding, sanding, opening a drawer, tightening a vise, and turning a screwdriver) using microphones and three-axis accelerometers mounted at two positions on the user's arms. Potentially \"interesting\" activities are segmented from continuous streams of data using an analysis of the sound intensity detected at the two different locations. Activity classification is then performed on these detected segments using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on the sound channel and hidden Markov models (HMMs) on the acceleration data. Four different methods at classifier fusion are compared for improving these classifications. Using user-dependent training, we obtain continuous average recall and precision rates (for positive activities) of 78 percent and 74 percent, respectively. Using user-independent training (leave-one-out across five users), we obtain recall rates of 66 percent and precision rates of 63 percent. In isolation, these activities were recognized with accuracies of 98 percent, 87 percent, and 95 percent for the user-dependent, user-independent, and user-adapted cases, respectively","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677514/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9091876","pubMedId":"16986539","volume":"28","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1677514/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Activity Recognition of Assembly Tasks Using Body-Worn Microphones and Accelerometers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Activity Recognition of Assembly Tasks Using Body-Worn Microphones and Accelerometers","sourcePdf":"01677514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049496S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","isNumber":"35279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"280","articleId":"1677514","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1677515,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In this paper, we focus on the recent technique proposed by Wainwright et al. (Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J. Wainwright, et al., Nov. 2005). In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/35279/01677515.pdf","startPage":"1568","endPage":"1583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergent Tree-Reweighted Message Passing for Energy Minimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Message passing","Belief propagation","Minimization methods","Tree graphs","Stereo vision","Markov random fields","Image restoration","Computer vision","Labeling","NP-hard problem"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","message passing","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergent tree-reweighted message passing","discrete energy minimization","computer vision","max-product message passing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy minimization","graph algorithms","message passing","belief propagation","early vision","Markov random fields","stereo."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Energy Transfer","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Convergent Tree-Reweighted Message Passing for Energy Minimization","volume":"28","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1677515/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9091877","pubMedId":"16986540","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergent Tree-Reweighted Message Passing for Energy Minimization","sourcePdf":"01677515.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098142S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"35279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"683","xplore-issue":"35279","articleId":"1677515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1677518,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

To create the training data for a base classifier, the feature set is randomly split into K subsets (K is a parameter of the algorithm) and principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to each subset. All principal components are retained in order to preserve the variability information in the data. Thus, K axis rotations take place to form the new features for a base classifier. The idea of the rotation approach is to encourage simultaneously individual accuracy and diversity within the ensemble. Diversity is promoted through the feature extraction for each base classifier. Decision trees were chosen here because they are sensitive to rotation of the feature axes, hence the name \"forest\". Accuracy is sought by keeping all principal components and also using the whole data set to train each base classifier. Using WEKA, we examined the rotation forest ensemble on a random selection of 33 benchmark data sets from the UCI repository and compared it with bagging, AdaBoost, and random forest. The results were favorable to rotation forest and prompted an investigation into diversity-accuracy landscape of the ensemble models. Diversity-error diagrams revealed that rotation forest ensembles construct individual classifiers which are more accurate than these in AdaBoost and random forest, and more diverse than these in bagging, sometimes more accurate as well","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/35279/01677518.pdf","startPage":"1619","endPage":"1630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotation Forest: A New Classifier Ensemble Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677518/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Rotation Forest: A New Classifier Ensemble Method","volume":"28","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9091880","pubMedId":"16986543","htmlLink":"/document/1677518/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotation Forest: A New Classifier Ensemble Method","sourcePdf":"01677518.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086052S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"35279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1157","xplore-issue":"35279","articleId":"1677518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":1677524,"authors":[{"name":"Kyong I.

An analytical expression of the magnetic field of the rotor is obtained based on Laplace's equation. Based on this expression and properties of air-core stator coils, Lorentz force law is employed for the study of the relationship between the rotor torque and coil input currents. By using linear superposition, the expression of the actuator torque in terms of current input to the stator coils can be obtained in a matrix form. The linear expression of the actuator torque will facilitate real-time motion control of the actuator as a servo system. Experimental works are carried out to measure the actual magnetic field distribution of the PM rotor in three-dimensional (3-D) space as well as to measure the actual 3-D motor torque generated by the actuator coils. The measurement results were coincident with analytical study on the rotor magnetic field distribution and actuator torque expressions.

Unlike most of the previous neural network identifiers, the proposed identifier is based on a nonlinear-in-parameters neural network (NLPNN). Therefore, it is applicable to systems with higher degrees of nonlinearities. Both parallel and series-parallel models are used with no a priori knowledge about the system dynamics. The method can be considered both as an online identifier that can be used as a basis for designing a neural network controller as well as an offline learning scheme for monitoring the system states. A novel approach is proposed for the weight updating mechanism based on the modification of the backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The stability of the overall system is shown using Lyapunov's direct method.

However, restricted by the slow improvement of memory accessing speed, the route lookup engines for next-generation terabit routers demand exploiting parallelism among multiple TCAM chips. Traditional parallel methods always incur excessive redundancy and high power consumption. We propose in this paper an original TCAM-based IP lookup scheme that achieves both ultra-high lookup throughput and optimal utilization of the memory while being power-efficient. In our multi-chip scheme, we devise a load-balanced TCAM table construction algorithm together with an adaptive load balancing mechanism. The power efficiency is well controlled by decreasing the number of TCAM entries triggered in each lookup operation. Using four 133 MHz TCAM chips and given 25% more TCAM entries than the original route table, the proposed scheme achieves a lookup throughput of up to 533 MPPS while remains simple for ASIC implementation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/35283/01677604.pdf","startPage":"863","endPage":"875","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2006.880171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2006.880171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A TCAM-based distributed parallel IP lookup scheme and performance analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Throughput","Energy consumption","Random access memory","Associative memory","Engines","Load management","Application specific integrated circuits","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","IP networks","resource allocation","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TCAM-based distributed parallel IP lookup scheme","performance analysis","ternary content addressable memory","high-speed IP address lookup","memory accessing speed","route lookup engines","next-generation terabit routers","multiple TCAM chips","ultra-high lookup throughput","load-balanced TCAM table construction algorithm","adaptive load balancing mechanism","ASIC implementation","133 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IP","power consumption","route lookup","TCAM","throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"A TCAM-based distributed parallel IP lookup scheme and performance analysis","volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1677604/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9060149","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A TCAM-based distributed parallel IP lookup scheme and performance analysis","sourcePdf":"01677604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119113S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"35283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"35283","articleId":"1677604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1677630,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

The control scheme consists of a synchronous frame decoupling current controller, MTPA torque controller, and adaptive parameter estimator. The estimator is applied to the q-axis current dynamics as the d-axis inductance can be assumed to be constant without loss of accuracy. Since the q-axis current dynamics is being disturbed by the magnet's back-EMF voltage, the proposed estimator is combined with a robust active-state decoupling scheme to ensure unbiased parameter estimate. The robust decoupling scheme is realized by estimating the magnet's flux linkage by a simple adaptation algorithm based on the steepest descent method. The system's model is greatly simplified when the robust decoupling scheme is combined with the q-axis current dynamics. Relying on the simplified model, a natural adaptive observer is used to estimate the q-axis current. Unknown motor parameters are estimated by minimizing the state estimation error using an iterative gradient algorithm offered by the affine projection.

The strategy is based on the direct control of stator active and reactive power by selecting appropriate voltage vectors on the rotor side. It is found that the initial rotor flux has no impact on the changes of the stator active and reactive power. The proposed method only utilizes the estimated stator flux so as to remove the difficulties associated with rotor flux estimation.

Desynchronization is a new paradigm to automate the design of asynchronous circuits from synchronous specifications, thus, permitting widespread adoption of asynchronicity without requiring special design skills or tools. In this paper, different protocols for desynchronization are first studied, and their correctness is formally proven using techniques originally developed for distributed deployment of synchronous language specifications. A taxonomy of existing protocols for asynchronous latch controllers, covering, in particular, the four-phase handshake protocols devised in the literature for micropipelines, is also provided. A new controller that exhibits provably maximal concurrency is then proposed, and the performance of desynchronized circuits is analyzed with respect to the original synchronous optimized implementation. Finally, this paper proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach by showing its application to a set of real designs, including a complete implementation of the DLX microprocessor architecture","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.860958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.860958","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/35285/01677680.pdf","startPage":"1904","endPage":"1921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Desynchronization: Synthesis of Asynchronous Circuits From Synchronous Specifications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Desynchronization: Synthesis of Asynchronous Circuits From Synchronous Specifications","volume":"25","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1677680/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9064064","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677680/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Desynchronization: Synthesis of Asynchronous Circuits From Synchronous Specifications","sourcePdf":"01677680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098496S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"35285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"35285","articleId":"1677680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1677683,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper proposes an original methodology based on estimations to reduce the impact on design time. It promotes a hierarchical exploration to mitigate the complexity of the exploration process. Therefore, this work takes place before any design step, such as compilation or behavioral synthesis, where the specification is still provided as a C program. The goal is to provide early area and delay evaluations of many register-transfer level (RTL) implementations to prune the design space. Two main steps compose the flow: 1) a structural exploration step defines several RTL implementations, and 2) a physical mapping estimation step computes the mapping characteristics of these onto a given FPGA device. For the structural exploration, a simple yet realistic RTL model reduces the complexity and permits a fast definition of solutions. At this stage, it focuses on the computation parallelism and memory bandwidth. Advanced optimizations using for instance loop tiling, scalar replacement, or data layout are not considered. For the physical estimations, an analytical approach is used to provide fast and accurate area/delay tradeoffs. The paper also do not consider the impact of routing on critical paths or other optimizations. The reduction of the complexity allows the evaluation of key design alternatives, namely target device and parallelism that can also include the effect of resource allocation, bitwidth, or clock period. Due to this, a designer can quickly identify a reliable subset of solutions for which further refinement can be applied to enhance the relevance of the final architecture and reach a better use of FPGA resources, i.e., an optimal level of performance. Experiments performed with Xilinx (VirtexE) and Altera (Apex20K) FPGAs for a two-dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform and a G722 speech coder lead to an average error of 10% for temporal values and 18% for area estimations","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.862742","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/35285/01677683.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.862742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"1950","endPage":"1968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design Space Pruning Through Early Estimations of Area/Delay Tradeoffs for FPGA Implementations","volume":"25","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1677683/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9064067","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Space Pruning Through Early Estimations of Area/Delay Tradeoffs for FPGA Implementations","sourcePdf":"01677683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102865S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"35285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"35285","articleId":"1677683","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1677685,"authors":[{"name":"D.-U.

The resulting diminished accuracy in the estimates of performance at the design stage can lead to a significant reduction in the parametric yield. Thus, determining an accurate statistical description (e.g., moments, distribution, etc.) of the interconnect's response is critical for designers. In the presence of significant variations, device or interconnect model parameters such as wire resistance, capacitance, etc., need to modeled as random variables or as spatial random processes. The corner-based analysis is not accurate, and simulations based on sampling require long computation times due to the large number of parameters or random variables. This study proposes an efficient method of computing the stochastic response of interconnects. The technique models the stochastic response in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space in terms of orthogonal polynomial expansions. A finite representation is obtained by projecting the infinite series representation onto a finite dimensional subspace. The advantage of the proposed method is that it provides a functional representation of the response of the system in terms of the random variables that represent the process variations. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a procedure called orthogonal polynomial expansions for response analysis (OPERA). Results from OPERA simulations on a number of design test cases match well with those from the classical Monte Carlo simulation program with integrated circuits emphasis (SPICE) and from perturbation methods. Additionally, OPERA shows good computational efficiency: speedup of up to two orders of magnitude have been observed over Monte Carlo SPICE simulations","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.862734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/35285/01677686.pdf","endPage":"2011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hermite Polynomial Based Interconnect Analysis in the Presence of Process Variations","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.862734","startPage":"2001","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Hermite Polynomial Based Interconnect Analysis in the Presence of Process Variations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677686/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","accessionNumber":"9064070","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1677686/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hermite Polynomial Based Interconnect Analysis in the Presence of Process Variations","sourcePdf":"01677686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094116S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"35285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"35285","articleId":"1677686","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1677688,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

However, Vdd-level converters used in the existing Vdd-programmable method consume a large amount of leakage. This paper proposes two ways to avoid using level converters in interconnects, namely; 1) tree-based level converter insertion (TLC) and 2) dual-Vdd tree-based level converter insertion (dTLC). TLC enforces that there is only one Vdd level within each routing tree, while dTLC can have different Vdd levels within a routing tree, but no VddL switch drives VddH switches. Dual-Vdd assignment algorithms were developed considering chip-level time slack allocation for maximum power reduction. The algorithms include TLC-S and dTLC-S, two power sensitivity-based algorithms with implicit time slack allocation, and dTLC-LP, a linear programming (LP)-based algorithm with explicit time slack allocation. All allocate time slack first to interconnects with higher power sensitivity and assign low Vdd to them for more power reduction. Experiments show that dTLC-LP obtains the lowest power consumption. Compared to dTLC-LP, dTLC-S obtains a slightly higher power consumption but runs three times faster. Compared to the existing segment-based level converter insertion for dual Vdd, dTLC-LP reduces interconnect power by 52.90% without performance loss for Microelectronics Center of North Carolina benchmark circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9064072","htmlLink":"/document/1677688/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dual-Vdd Interconnect With Chip-Level Time Slack Allocation for FPGA Power Reduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Vdd Interconnect With Chip-Level Time Slack Allocation for FPGA Power Reduction","sourcePdf":"01677688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090624S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"35285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"35285","articleId":"1677688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1677689,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Memories are responsible for a significant percentage of a system's aggregate energy consumption. Consequently, novel memories as well as novel-memory architectures are being designed to reduce the energy consumption. Caches and scratchpads are two contrasting memory architectures. The former relies on hardware logic while the latter relies on software for its utilization. To meet different requirements, most contemporary high-end embedded microprocessors include on-chip instruction and data caches along with a scratchpad. Previous approaches for utilizing scratchpad did not consider caches and hence fail for the contemporary high-end systems. Instructions are allocated onto the scratchpad, while taking into account the behavior of the instruction cache present in the system. The problem of scratchpad allocation is solved using a heuristic and also optimally using an integer linear programming formulation. An average reduction of 7% and 23% in processor cycles and instruction-memory energy, respectively, is reported when compared against a previously published technique. The average deviation between optimal and nonoptimal solutions was found to be less than 6% both in terms of processor cycles and energy. The scratchpad in the presented architecture is similar to a preloaded loop cache. Comparing the energy consumption of the presented approach against that of a preloaded loop cache, an average reduction of 9% and 29% in processor cycles and instruction-memory energy, respectively, is reported","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache-Aware Scratchpad-Allocation Algorithms for Energy-Constrained Embedded Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.859523","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/35285/01677689.pdf","startPage":"2035","endPage":"2051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.859523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Cache-Aware Scratchpad-Allocation Algorithms for Energy-Constrained Embedded Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1677689/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9064073","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache-Aware Scratchpad-Allocation Algorithms for Energy-Constrained Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"01677689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090787S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"35285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"35285","articleId":"1677689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1677692,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It demonstrates that one of the greatest impediments to achieving high-quality placements using a force-directed placer lies in the large amount of cell overlap present in initial placements. This overlap makes the determination of cell ordering difficult and can lead to the inadvertent separation of highly connected cells. It is shown that median improvement and multilevel clustering improve cell ordering and aid in wire length minimization.

In this paper, a canonical first-order delay model that takes into account both correlated and independent randomness is proposed. A novel linear-time block-based statistical timing algorithm is employed to propagate timing quantities like arrival times and required arrival times through the timing graph in this canonical form. At the end of the statistical timing, the sensitivity of all timing quantities to each of the sources of variation is available. Excessive sensitivities can then be targeted by manual or automatic optimization methods to improve the robustness of the design. This paper also reports the first incremental statistical timer in the literature, which is suitable for use in the inner loop of physical synthesis or other optimization programs. The third novel contribution of this paper is the computation of local and global criticality probabilities. For a very small cost in computer time, the probability of each edge or node of the timing graph being critical is computed.

On one hand, sacrificing the security for testability by using a traditional scan-based DFT restricts its use in privacy sensitive applications. On the other hand, sacrificing the testability for security by abandoning the scan-based DFT hurts the product quality. The security of a crypto chip comes from the small secret key stored in a few registers, and the testability of a crypto chip comes from the data path and control path implementing the crypto algorithm. Based on this key observation, the authors propose a novel scan DFT architecture called secure scan that maintains the high test quality of traditional scan DFT without compromising the security. They used a hardware implementation of the advanced encryption standard to show that the traditional scan DFT scheme can compromise the secret key. They then showed that by using secure-scan DFT, neither the secret key nor the testability of the AES implementation is compromised","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided

registration of magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. There are two novelties in the proposed registration method. First, a set of best-scale geometric features are selected for each point in the brain, in order to facilitate correspondence detection during the registration procedure. This is achieved by optimizing an energy function that requires each point to have its best-scale geometric features consistent over the corresponding points in the training samples, and at the same time distinctive from those of nearby points in the neighborhood. Second, the active points used to drive the brain registration are hierarchically selected during the registration procedure, based on their saliency and consistency measures. That is, the image points with salient and consistent features (across different individuals) are considered for the initial registration of two images, while other less salient and consistent points join the registration procedure later. By incorporating these two novel strategies into the framework of the HAMMER registration algorithm, the registration accuracy has been improved according to the results on simulated brain data, and also visible improvement is observed particularly in the cortical regions of real brain data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2006.879320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/35286/01677721.pdf","startPage":"1145","endPage":"1157","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2006.879320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-based deformable registration of MR brain images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Learning-based deformable registration of MR brain images","volume":"25","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1677721/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9048632","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","pubMedId":"16967800","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677721/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-based deformable registration of MR brain images","sourcePdf":"01677721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172873S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"35286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"35286","articleId":"1677721","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1677726,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The Gabor wavelet is capable of tuning to specific frequencies, thus allowing noise filtering and vessel enhancement in a single step. We use a Bayesian classifier with class-conditional probability density functions (likelihoods) described as Gaussian mixtures, yielding a fast classification, while being able to model complex decision surfaces. The probability distributions are estimated based on a training set of labeled pixels obtained from manual segmentations. The method's performance is evaluated on publicly available DRIVE (Staal et al.,2004) and STARE (Hoover et al.,2000) databases of manually labeled images.

Automatic grading of the images is being considered by health boards so that the human grading task is reduced. Microaneurysms (MAs) are the earliest sign of this disease and so are very important for classifying whether images show signs of retinopathy. This paper describes automatic methods for MA detection and shows how image contrast normalization can improve the ability to distinguish between MAs and other dots that occur on the retina.

The resulting model provides at low numerical cost simulations of the nonlinear ocean surface Doppler spectrum at L-band. As a result of approximations, the model is designed for a low-wind speed, typically up to 5 m/s. It is shown that applying directly a second-order model such as Creamer (2) to a semiempirical sea surface spectrum induces an unrealistic magnification of small-scale roughness that is involved in the scattering process at microwave frequencies. This paper thus proposes an undressed version of the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum that corrects this artifact. Full-polarized Doppler simulations at L-band and 70deg incidence are presented. Effects of the surface nonlinearities are outlined, and the simulated Doppler spectra show correct variations with respect to wind speed and direction","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/35287/01677752.pdf","startPage":"2430","endPage":"2437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.873580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.873580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doppler Spectra From a Two-Dimensional Ocean Surface at L-Band","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oceans","Sea surface","L-band","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Integral equations","Costs","Numerical simulation","Electromagnetic scattering","Microwave frequencies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","oceanographic techniques","oceanography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler spectra","2D ocean surface","L-band","time-harmonic three-dimensional electromagnetic boundary-integral method","small-slope integral equation","series expansion","Creamer surface representation","low numerical cost simulations","nonlinear ocean surface Doppler spectrum","sea surface spectrum","small-scale roughness","scattering process","microwave frequencies","Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum","full-polarized Doppler simulations","surface nonlinearities","wind speed","wind direction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doppler radar","nonlinear wave propagation","remote sensing","sea surface electromagnetic scattering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Doppler Spectra From a Two-Dimensional Ocean Surface at L-Band","volume":"44","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1677752/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9067012","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doppler Spectra From a Two-Dimensional Ocean Surface at L-Band","sourcePdf":"01677752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085114S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"35287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"35287","articleId":"1677752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1677762,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Given a high spatial resolution panchromatic (Pan) image and a lowspatial resolution multispectral (MS) image acquired on the same geographical area, the presented method aims to enhance the spatial resolution of the MS image to the resolution of the Pan observation. The proposed fusion technique utilizes the spatial correlation of each of the high-resolution MS channels by using an autoregressive (AR) model, whose parameters are learnt from the analysis of the Pan data. Under the assumption that the parameters of the AR model for the Pan image are the same as those that represent the MS images due to spectral correlation, the proposed technique exploits the learnt parameter values in the context of a proper regularization technique to estimate the high spatial resolution fields for the MS bands. This results in a combination of the spectral characteristics of the low-resolution MS data with the high spatial resolution of the Pan image. The main advantages of the proposed technique are: 1) unlike standard methods proposed in the literature, it requires no registration between the Pan and the MS images; 2) it models effectively the texture of the scene during the fusion process; 3) it shows very small spectral distortion (as it is less affected, compared to standard methods, by the specific digital numbers of pixels in the Pan image, since it exploits the learnt parameters from the Pan image rather than the actual Pan digital numbers for fusion); and 4) it can be used in critical situations in which the Pan and the MS images are acquired (also by different sensors) in slightly different areas. Quantitative experimental results obtained using Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Quickbird images point out the effectiveness of the proposed method","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model-Based Approach to Multiresolution Fusion in Remotely Sensed Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.873340","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/35287/01677765.pdf","startPage":"2549","endPage":"2562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.873340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677765/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Based Approach to Multiresolution Fusion in Remotely Sensed Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1677765/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9067025","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Based Approach to Multiresolution Fusion in Remotely Sensed Images","sourcePdf":"01677765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089001S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"35287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"35287","articleId":"1677765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1677767,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This paper investigates a new application of the ICA in endmember extraction and abundance quantification for hyperspectral imagery. An endmember is generally referred to as an idealized pure signature for a class whose presence is considered to be rare. When it occurs, it may not appear in large population. In this case, the commonly used principal components analysis may not be effective since endmembers usually contribute very little in statistics to data variance. In order to substantiate the author's findings, an ICA-based approach, called ICA-based abundance quantification algorithm (ICA-AQA) is developed. Three novelties result from the author's proposed ICA-AQA. First, unlike the commonly used least squares abundance-constrained linear spectral mixture analysis (ACLSMA) which is a second-order statistics-based method, the ICA-AQA is a high-order statistics-based technique. Second, due to the use of statistical independency, it is generally thought that the ICA cannot be implemented as a constrained method. The ICA-AQA shows otherwise. Third, in order for the ACLSMA to perform the abundance quantification, it requires an algorithm to find image endmembers first then followed by an abundance-constrained algorithm for quantification. As opposed to such a two-stage process, the ICA-AQA can accomplish endmember extraction and abundance quantification simultaneously in one-shot operation. Experimental results demonstrate that the ICA-AQA performs at least comparably to abundance-constrained methods","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/35287/01677768.pdf","startPage":"2601","endPage":"2616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.874135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.874135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of Independent Component Analysis in Endmember Extraction and Abundance Quantification for Hyperspectral Imagery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Independent component analysis","Hyperspectral imaging","Signal processing algorithms","Image processing","Remote sensing","Pixel","Hyperspectral sensors","Spatial resolution","Image analysis","Spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical techniques","independent component analysis","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["independent component analysis","hyperspectral imagery","endmember extraction","abundance quantification algorithm","ICA-AQA","abundance-constrained linear spectral mixture analysis","ACLSMA","second-order statistics-based method","Fastica","high-order statistics","independent component prioritization algorithm","virtual dimensionality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Abundance-constrained linear spectral mixture analysis (ACLSMA)","abundance quantification","endmember extraction","FastICA","high-order statistics-based independent component (IC) prioritization algorithm (HOS-ICPA)","IC prioritization","ICA-based endmember extraction algorithm (ICA-EEA)","independent component analysis (ICA)-based abundance quantification algorithm (ICA-AQA)","initialization driven-based IC prioritization algorithm (ID-ICPA)","virtual dimensionality (VD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Independent Component Analysis in Endmember Extraction and Abundance Quantification for Hyperspectral Imagery","volume":"44","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1677768/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9067028","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Independent Component Analysis in Endmember Extraction and Abundance Quantification for Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"01677768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099848S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"35287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"35287","articleId":"1677768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1677777,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Shao","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/35288/1677777/1677777-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Shao was born in Chengdu, China, on March 11, 1975.

The benefits of being able to do this include quantifying the comparison of data that has hitherto only been assessed qualitatively, to provide the ability to track differences between model iterations, and to provide a means of capturing the variability and range of opinions of groups and teams of workers. The feature selective validation (FSV) technique shows great promise for achieving this goal. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the FSV method, setting it firmly in the context of previous comparison techniques; it suggests the relationship between validation of graphically presented data and the psychology of visual perception. A set of applicability tests to judge the effectiveness of computer-based CEM validation techniques is also proposed.

To facilitate the transmission, video content is compressed to save the bandwidth. The compression algorithms remove the redundancies in the video signal, meanwhile increasing the dependencies among symbols in the compressed bit-stream. Thus, when errors occur, they may propagate in both space and time. Among various error control techniques, error concealment (EC) is an effective method that is performed at the decoder to mitigate the influence of errors on the quality of reconstructed images. In this paper, a joint spatial and temporal EC algorithm (JSTEC) is presented. First, several existing temporal EC algorithms are combined in an appropriate order. Then, the spatial correlation in the video is exploited in an iterative form to improve the performance of the temporal EC. Experimental results show that JSTEC performs better both in peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective quality of images than the existing algorithms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/35289/01677810.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined and iterative form of spatial and temporal error concealment for video signals","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2006.880323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2006.880323","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677810/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Combined and iterative form of spatial and temporal error concealment for video signals","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9050140","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"52","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1677810/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined and iterative form of spatial and temporal error concealment for video signals","sourcePdf":"01677810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088631S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"35289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"35289","articleId":"1677810","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1677815,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In standards 802.16-2004 and 802.16e, the basic allocation units are comprised of sub-channels and OFDMA time symbols; each sub-channel is a group of sub-carriers, so that all the sub-channels are considered equally adequate to all users. We study the naturally arising new approach of two-dimensional mapping of incoming requests into the matrix that represents the system resources, where each allocation is of an arbitrary multi-rectangular shape (to the best of our knowledge, this approach has not been discussed elsewhere). We define a cost model and constraints related to practical OFDMA systems, which depend on the spatial shape of the two-dimensional allocation; the main objective function is the spatial efficiency. We show that the arising problem, even in its simplest form, is NP-hard . We present run-time efficient heuristic solutions for various mapping problems, taking into account the above QoS and OFDMA related constraints. In particular, a novel solution for two-dimensional mapping under priority constraints is suggested. Extensive simulations with parameters of real systems were used to investigate the performance of the proposed solutions in terms of throughput, delay and system load. The results show that high throughput can be achieved with relatively simple mapping algorithms. We believe that the proposed two-dimensional mapping approach is prospective, due to its fitness to modern standards","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional mapping for wireless OFDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2006.879937","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/35289/01677815.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2006.879937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35289","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional mapping for wireless OFDMA systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1677815/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9050145","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional mapping for wireless OFDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01677815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08882S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"35289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"35289","articleId":"1677815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1677816,"authors":[{"name":"Won-Gyu Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Won-Gyu Song","id":"38039274100"},{"name":"Jong-Tae Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Tae Lim","id":"37276358700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"1677816","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Transmitters","Iterative algorithms","Performance analysis","Transmitting antennas","Guidelines","Fading","Time frequency analysis","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","OFDM modulation","regression analysis","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional regression model","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","channel estimation","multiple transmitting antennas","expectation-maximization algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Based on a nonlinear two-dimensional (2-D) regression model, we analyze the OFDM system performance with respect to the operation block size and pilot density.

Intrinsic noise mechanisms fundamental to device operation include channel thermal noise, induced gate noise, and induced substrate noise. While the effect of channel thermal noise is observable at zero drain-to-source voltage, the induced gate and substrate noise do not manifest themselves under these conditions. However, the attendant fluctuations in the channel charge are observable by the passage of electric current through the device. Extrinsic noise mechanisms manifested due to structural evolution of the MOSFET include the distributed gate resistance noise, distributed substrate resistance noise, bulk charge effects, substrate current supershot noise, gate current noise, excess channel noise, and 1/f noise. Where available, compact noise models covering these noise mechanisms are explained. Also, where possible, methods of suppression of these mechanisms are highlighted. A survey of current public domain MOS models is presented, and a lack of comprehensive coverage of noise models is noted.

These demanding requirements on compact models extend beyond the core model to a suite of design tools that include extraction tools and statistical methods to account for unpredictable variation (e.g., random dopant fluctuations and polysilicon linewidth variation) and predictable variation (e.g., transistor response differences that are layout dependent). Layout-dependent or local environment differences are driven by factors such as lithography and novel performance-enhancing process techniques such as dual-stress nitride liner films. Sources of variation such as rapid thermal annealing temperature, low-frequency noise, and modeling of back-end-of-line elements need to be considered.

The fabricated 17-stage direct-coupled field-effect transistor logic ring oscillator using the 1-mum-gate technology can operate properly at a larger supply voltage of 3.5 V, and a minimum propagation delay of 130 ps/stage is achieved","doi":"10.1109/TED.2005.881002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/35290/01677857.pdf","startPage":"2223","endPage":"2230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2005.881002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithically Integrated Enhancement/Depletion-Mode AlGaN/GaN HEMT Inverters and Ring Oscillators Using<tex>$hboxCF_4$</tex>Plasma Treatment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677857/","displayDocTitle":"Monolithically Integrated Enhancement/Depletion-Mode AlGaN/GaN HEMT Inverters and Ring Oscillators Using<tex>$hboxCF_4$</tex>Plasma Treatment","volume":"53","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9066847","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithically Integrated Enhancement/Depletion-Mode AlGaN/GaN HEMT Inverters and Ring Oscillators Using<tex>$hboxCF_4$</tex>Plasma Treatment","sourcePdf":"01677857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048547S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","isNumber":"35290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"69","articleId":"1677857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1677869,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

However, many of these applications require the capability of detecting low-level light. Therefore, the noise in CMOS sensors must be carefully considered. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the signal and noise properties in active pixel sensor (APS) elements. An optimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 54 dB is achieved by varying the integration time. Based on a rigorous reset-time analysis of the APS, the dc level of the sense node is proposed as the new output signal, which is more sensitive to low-level light than existing APS techniques. By varying the reset time, an optimum SNR of 56 dB is achieved for a 30-ms integration time.

Although objective functions in a least-squares sense can be easily formulated, their minimization is not trivial, because constraints and fourth-order terms are usually involved. Most known optimization algorithms are, therefore, subject to certain restrictions on the class of problems: orthogonal transformations, sets of symmetric, Hermitian or positive definite matrices, to name a few. In this paper, we present a new algorithm called QDIAG that splits the overall optimization problem into a sequence of simpler second order subproblems. There are no restrictions imposed on the transformation matrix, which may be nonorthogonal, indefinite, or even rectangular, and there are no restrictions regarding the symmetry and definiteness of the matrices to be diagonalized, except for one of them. We apply the new method to second-order blind source separation and show that the algorithm converges fast and reliably.

Two virtual subarrays are used to form a signal whose phase relative to the reference signal is a function of the DOA. The DOA is then estimated based on the computation of the phase shift between the reference signal and its phase-shifted version. Since the phase-shifted reference signal is obtained after interference rejection through beamforming, the effect of cochannel interference on the estimation is significantly reduced. The proposed technique is computationally simple, and the number of signal sources detectable is not bounded by the number of antenna elements used.

Many existing localization ideas assume that only one speaker is active at a time. In this paper, we focus on a more realistic assumption that the number of active speakers is unknown and time-varying. Such an assumption results in a more complex localization problem, and we employ the random finite set (RFS) theory to deal with that problem. The RFS concepts provide us with an effective, solid foundation where the multispeaker locations and the number of speakers are integrated to form a single set-valued variable. By applying a sequential Monte Carlo implementation, we develop a Bayesian RFS filter that simultaneously tracks the time-varying speaker locations and number of speakers.

However, the encoding nature of the DSTF schemes that expand several OFDM symbol periods makes the DSTF schemes susceptible to fast-changing channel conditions. In this paper, we propose a differential scheme for MIMO-OFDM systems that is able to differentially encode signal within two OFDM symbol periods, and the proposed scheme transmits the differentially encoded signal within one OFDM block. The scheme not only reduces encoding and decoding delay but also relaxes the restriction on channel assumption. The successful differential decoding of the proposed scheme depends on the assumption that the fading channels keep constant over two OFDM symbol periods rather than multiple of them as required in the existing DSTF schemes. We also provide pairwise error probability analysis and quantify the performance criteria in terms of diversity and coding advantages. The design criteria reveal that the existing diagonal cyclic codes can be applied to achieve full diversity. Performance simulations under various channel conditions show that our proposed scheme yields superior performance to previously proposed differential schemes","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-block differential transmit scheme for broadband wireless MIMO-OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.877645","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/35291/01677898.pdf","startPage":"3305","endPage":"3314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.877645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677898/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Single-block differential transmit scheme for broadband wireless MIMO-OFDM systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1677898/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9052248","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-block differential transmit scheme for broadband wireless MIMO-OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"01677898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094838S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"35291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"35291","articleId":"1677898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1677899,"authors":[{"name":"L.

We provide performance analysis of the proposed detection strategies in terms of the (asymptotic) signal-to-(interference plus noise) ratio and the bit error rate, and we show that AAF achieves a full second-order diversity when a minimum mean-square-error detector is employed at both the relay side and the BS.

The problem of finding the most likely transmitted symbol is often equivalent to finding the closest lattice point to a given point and is known to be NP-hard. In systems that employ error-correcting coding for data protection, the symbol space forms a sparse lattice, where the sparsity structure is determined by the code. In such systems, ML data recovery may be geometrically interpreted as a search for the closest point in the sparse lattice. In this paper, motivated by the idea of the \"sphere decoding\" algorithm of Fincke and Pohst, we propose an algorithm that finds the closest point in the sparse lattice to the given vector. This given vector is not arbitrary, but rather is an unknown sparse lattice point that has been perturbed by an additive noise vector whose statistical properties are known. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is thus a random variable. We study its expected value, averaged over the noise and over the lattice. For binary linear block codes, we find the expected complexity in closed form. Simulation results indicate significant performance gains over systems employing separate detection and decoding, yet are obtained at a complexity that is practically feasible over a wide range of system parameters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On joint detection and decoding of linear block codes on Gaussian vector channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.877675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/35291/01677900.pdf","startPage":"3330","endPage":"3342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.877675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677900/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","displayDocTitle":"On joint detection and decoding of linear block codes on Gaussian vector channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1677900/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9052250","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On joint detection and decoding of linear block codes on Gaussian vector channels","sourcePdf":"01677900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125034S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"35291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"35291","articleId":"1677900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1677903,"authors":[{"name":"Luzhou Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/35291/1677903/1677903-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luzhou Xu (S'05) received the B.Eng. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively.

In the early stage of an attack, however, these changes are hard to detect and difficult to distinguish from usual traffic fluctuations. Rapid response, a minimal false-alarm rate, and the capability to detect a wide spectrum of attacks are the crucial features of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we develop efficient adaptive sequential and batch-sequential methods for an early detection of attacks that lead to changes in network traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These methods employ a statistical analysis of data from multiple layers of the network protocol to detect very subtle traffic changes. The algorithms are based on change-point detection theory and utilize a thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms while allowing us to detect changes in statistical models as soon as possible. There are three attractive features of the proposed approach. First, the developed algorithms are self-learning, which enables them to adapt to various network loads and usage patterns. Secondly, they allow for the detection of attacks with a small average delay for a given false-alarm rate. Thirdly, they are computationally simple and thus can be implemented online. Theoretical frameworks for detection procedures are presented. We also give the results of the experimental study with the use of a network simulator testbed as well as real-life testing for TCP SYN flooding attacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","accessionNumber":"9059819","htmlLink":"/document/1677904/","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach to detection of intrusions in computer networks via adaptive sequential and batch-sequential change-point detection methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach to detection of intrusions in computer networks via adaptive sequential and batch-sequential change-point detection methods","sourcePdf":"01677904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.23672S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"35291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"35291","articleId":"1677904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1677905,"authors":[{"name":"Husheng Li","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/35291/1677905/1677905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Husheng Li (S'00\u2013M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 2005.","In 2005, he joined Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA.

We also derive conditions on the parameters of the modulation signals to achieve multipath diversity. Furthermore, we propose the use of TV pilot signals with nonlinear instantaneous frequency and matched time-frequency (TF) techniques to estimate fast-fading channels with unknown state information. The proposed algorithm simplifies to the estimation of the parameters of multiple linear chirps, which we perform using the modified matching pursuit decomposition. We compare our estimation method with the use of pilot signals with linear instantaneous frequency, which we implement using the reassigned spectrogram. The proposed modulation scheme is applied to a frequency-hopped code-division multiple-access system for which we demonstrate improved performance when compared with frequency-shift-keying (FSK) modulation due to the designed multipath diversity and low multiple-access interference.

However, appropriate dictionaries for a given application may not be able to meet the incoherence condition. In such a case, decomposition algorithms may completely fail in the retrieval of the sparsest approximation. This paper studies the effect of introducing a priori knowledge when recovering sparse approximations over redundant dictionaries. Theoretical results show how the use of reliable a priori information (which in this paper appears under the form of weights) can improve the performances of standard approaches such as greedy algorithms and relaxation methods. Our results reduce to the classical case when no prior information is available. Examples validate and illustrate our theoretical statements.

Several methods for estimating either the true channel order or its most significant part (the so-called effective channel order) have been recently proposed, but a solution able to work in practical scenarios (low or moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and channels with small leading and/or trailing coefficients) has not been found yet. In this paper, a new criterion for effective channel order detection of SIMO channels is presented. The method is based on the fact that the cost function typically used in blind identification algorithms decreases monotonically with the estimated channel order, whereas for blind equalization algorithms, the cost function increases monotonically.

Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimators of symbol timing and CFO have been derived under the assumption of nondispersive channel and by modeling the OFDM signal vector as a circular complex Gaussian random vector (C-CGRV). The Gaussian assumption is reasonable when the number of subcarriers is sufficiently large. However, if the data symbols belong to an NC constellation, the received signal vector becomes an NC-CGRV, i.e., a CGRV whose relation matrix (defined as the statistical expectation of the product between the vector and its transpose) is not identically zero. Hence, in this case, previously mentioned estimators, termed MLC estimators, are not ML estimators. In this paper, by exploiting the joint probability density function for NC-CGRVs, ML estimators are derived. Moreover, since their implementation complexity is high, feasible computational algorithms are considered. Finally, refined symbol timing estimators, apt to counteract the degrading effects of intersymbol interference (ISI) in dispersive channels, are suggested. The performance of the derived estimators is assessed via computer simulation and compared with that of MLC estimators and that of modified MLC (MMLC) estimators exploiting only ISI-free samples of the cyclic prefix","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML-based symbol timing and frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems with noncircular transmissions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.877671","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/35291/01677917.pdf","startPage":"3527","endPage":"3541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.877671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","displayDocTitle":"ML-based symbol timing and frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems with noncircular transmissions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9052261","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML-based symbol timing and frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems with noncircular transmissions","sourcePdf":"01677917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049396S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","isNumber":"35291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1677917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1677918,"authors":[{"name":"Darryl Dexu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/35291/1677918/1677918-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Darryl Dexu Lin (S'01) received the B.A.Sc. degree (with honors) in engineering science and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2001 and 2003, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include statistical inference and its applications in CDMA multiuser detection and multicarrier modulation."]},"lastName":"Darryl Dexu Lin","id":"37087289731"},{"name":"R.A.

However, the practical receiver encounters nonnegligible phase noise (PHN) and carrier frequency offset (CFO), which create substantial intercarrier interference that a conventional OFDM channel estimator cannot account for. In this paper, we introduce an optimal (maximum a posteriori) joint estimator for the channel impulse response (CIR), CFO, and PHN, utilizing prior statistical knowledge of PHN that can be obtained from measurements or data sheets. In addition, in cases where a training symbol consists of two identical halves in the time domain, we propose a variant to Moose's CFO estimation algorithm that optimally removes the effect of PHN with lower complexity than with a nonrepeating training symbol. To further reduce the complexity of the proposed algorithms, simplified implementations based on the conjugate gradient method are also introduced such that the estimators studied in this paper can be realized efficiently using the fast Fourier transform with only minor performance degradation.

Several algorithms are available for optimal joint beamforming and power control for the downlink. Such optimal beamforming minimizes the total transmission power, while ensuring an individual target quality of service (QoS) for each user; alternatively the weakest QoS is maximized, subject to a power constraint. Herein, we consider both formulations and some of the available algorithms are generalized to enable indefinite quadratic shaping constraints on the beamformers. By imposing such additional constraints, the QoS measure can be extended to take other factors than the customary signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) into account. Alternatively, other limitations such as interference requirements or physical constraints may be handled within the optimization. We also consider a more general SINR expression than previously analyzed, which allows for more accurate modeling, e.g., of nonzero self-interference in code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems.

In this paper, new semiblind techniques are developed to jointly estimate the receiver CSI of multiple multiantenna transmitters that use orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs). The proposed techniques are based on the extension of the concepts of the popular Capon and MUSIC spectral estimators to the problem of multiuser channel estimation. Our methods blindly estimate the subspace that contains the user channel matrices, and then use only a few training symbol blocks to extract the user CSI from this subspace. It is demonstrated that, in addition to improving the bandwidth efficiency, the proposed techniques offer better channel estimation accuracy as compared with the standard (nonblind) least-squares (LS) channel estimation method. Moreover, it is shown that using the proposed Capon- and MUSIC-based semiblind channel estimators along with the coherent maximum-likelihood (ML) or the minimum-variance (MV) multiuser MIMO receivers results in a substantially better performance as compared with the case when the standard LS channel estimates are used","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/35291/01677921.pdf","startPage":"3581","endPage":"3591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.877650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.877650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semiblind multiuser MIMO channel estimation using capon and MUSIC techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Multiple signal classification","Maximum likelihood estimation","Channel state information","Maximum likelihood decoding","Space time codes","Transmitters","Block codes","Multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","channel coding","channel estimation","least squares approximations","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO systems","multiuser channels","radio networks","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiblind multiuser MIMO channel estimation","Capon spectral estimators","MUSIC techniques","channel state information","multiple-input multiple-output systems","space-time codes","orthogonal space-time block codes","channel matrices","least squares methods","maximum-likelihood estimation","minimum-variance multiuser MIMO receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capon and MUSIC techniques","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers","semiblind MIMO channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Semiblind multiuser MIMO channel estimation using capon and MUSIC techniques","volume":"54","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1677921/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9052265","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semiblind multiuser MIMO channel estimation using capon and MUSIC techniques","sourcePdf":"01677921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.205743S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"35291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"35291","articleId":"1677921","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1677922,"authors":[{"name":"K.

These methods, even though asymptotically optimal under certain conditions, pose a difficult global optimization problem. It is shown that the associated objective function may have multiple local optima and saddle points, and hence any local search method might stagnate at a suboptimal solution. In this correspondence, we formulate the problem as a convex feasibility problem and apply a distributed version of the projection-onto-convex-sets (POCS) method. We give a closed-form expression for the projection phase, which usually constitutes the heaviest computational aspect of POCS. Conditions are given under which, when the number of samples increases to infinity or in the absence of measurement noise, the convex feasibility problem has a unique solution at the true source location.

A complex exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) is used to model the channel. We consider a block transmission system, where on the transmit side a precoder is employed to enable the maximum available diversity for a CE-BEM channel. After direct decoding on the receive side, the resulting channel resembles a finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter on both block and symbol level. We therefore propose an equalizer that bears a structure analogous to the effective channel.

With the assumptions that all users have the same number of receive antennas and utilize all receive antennas when scheduled for transmission, the number of simultaneously supportable users with BD is limited by the ratio of the number of base station transmit antennas to the number of user receive antennas. In a downlink MIMO system with a large number of users, the base station may select a subset of users to serve in order to maximize the total throughput. The brute-force search for the optimal user set, however, is computationally prohibitive. We propose two low-complexity suboptimal user selection algorithms for multiuser MIMO systems with BD. Both algorithms aim to select a subset of users such that the total throughput is nearly maximized. The first user selection algorithm greedily maximizes the total throughput, whereas the criterion of the second algorithm is based on the channel energy. We show that both algorithms have linear complexity in the total number of users and achieve around 95% of the total throughput of the complete search method in simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.879269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.879269","startPage":"3658","endPage":"3663","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/35291/01677932.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity user selection algorithms for multiuser MIMO systems with block diagonalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity user selection algorithms for multiuser MIMO systems with block diagonalization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","volume":"54","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1677932/","accessionNumber":"9052272","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677932/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity user selection algorithms for multiuser MIMO systems with block diagonalization","sourcePdf":"01677932.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068799S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"35291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"379","xplore-issue":"35291","articleId":"1677932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":1677943,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

The current approach to these applications is to use a single manned vehicle for surveillance. However, manned vehicles are typically large and expensive. In addition, hazardous environments and operator fatigue can potentially threaten the life of the pilot. Therefore, there is a critical need for automating aerial surveillance using unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This paper gives an overview of a cooperative control strategy for aerial surveillance that has been successfully flight tested on small (48-in wingspan) UAVs. Our approach to cooperative control problems can be summarized in four steps: 1) the definition of a cooperation constraint and cooperation objective; 2) the definition of a coordination variable as the minimal amount of information needed to effect cooperation; 3) the design of a centralized cooperation strategy; and 4) the use of consensus schemes to transform the centralized strategy into a decentralized algorithm.

We present an approach to distributed multirobot mapping and exploration. Our system enables teams of robots to efficiently explore environments from different, unknown locations. In order to ensure consistency when combining their data into shared maps, the robots actively seek to verify their relative locations. Using shared maps, they coordinate their exploration strategies to maximize the efficiency of exploration. This system was evaluated under extremely realistic real-world conditions.

Analogous to structured language models where syntactic structure is exploited to represent long-distance relationships among words , the structured speech model described in this paper makes use of the dynamic structure in the hidden vocal tract resonance space to characterize long-span contextual influence among phonetic units. A general overview is provided first on hierarchically classified types of dynamic speech models in the literature. A detailed account is then given for a specific model type called the hidden trajectory model, and we describe detailed steps of model construction and the parameter estimation algorithms. We show how the use of resonance target parameters and their temporal filtering enables joint modeling of long-span coarticulation and phonetic reduction effects. Experiments on phonetic recognition evaluation demonstrate superior recognizer performance over a modern hidden Markov model-based system.

In the last couple of years, the availability of large amounts of roughly transcribed acoustic training data and advanced model training techniques has offered the opportunity to greatly reduce the error rate on this task. This paper describes the design and performance of BN transcription systems which make use of these developments. First, the effects of using lightly supervised training data and advanced acoustic modeling techniques are discussed. The design of a real-time broadcast news recognition system is then detailed using these new models. As system combination has been found to yield large gains in performance, a range of frameworks that allow multiple recognition outputs to be combined are next described. These include the use of multiple types of acoustic models and multiple segmentations. As a contrast a system developed by multiple sites allowing cross-site combination, the \"SuperEARS\" system, is also described. The various models and recognition configurations are evaluated using several recent BN development and evaluation test sets. These new BN transcription systems can give gains of over 25% relative to the CU-HTK 2003 BN system","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/35293/01677973.pdf","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2006.878264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2006.878264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progress in the CU-HTK broadcast news transcription system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Training data","Error analysis","Acoustic testing","Speech recognition","Ear","Loudspeakers","Availability","Real time systems","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CU-HTK broadcast news transcription system","roughly transcribed acoustic training data","advanced acoustic model training techniques","error rate reduction","lightly supervised training data","real-time broadcast news recognition system","multiple recognition outputs","multiple segmentations","cross-site combination","SuperEARS system","recognition configurations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic speech recognition","broadcast news (BN) transcription","diarization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Progress in the CU-HTK broadcast news transcription system","volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1677973/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9051101","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progress in the CU-HTK broadcast news transcription system","sourcePdf":"01677973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144103S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"35293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"35293","articleId":"1677973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1677974,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/35293/1677974/1677974-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Liu (M'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2004.","Before joining the University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, in 2005, she was a Researcher with the International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, CA, from 2002 to 2005.

Through the use of heuristic variations of signal and parameter repetition and overlap-add interpolation to handle packet loss, conventional PLC systems largely ignore the dynamics of the statistical evolution of the speech signal, possibly leading to perceptually annoying artifacts. To address this problem, we propose the use of hidden Markov models for PLC. With a hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking the evolution of speech signal parameters, we demonstrate how PLC is performed within a statistical signal processing framework. Moreover, we show how the HMM is used to index a specially designed PLC module for the particular signal context, leading to signal-contingent PLC. Simulation examples, objective tests, and subjective listening tests are provided showing the ability of an HMM-based PLC built with a sinusoidal analysis/synthesis model to provide better loss concealment than a conventional PLC based on the same sinusoidal model for all types of speech signals, including onsets and signal transitions","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.858561","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/35293/01677981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.858561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35293","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov model-based packet loss concealment for voice over IP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov model-based packet loss concealment for voice over IP","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9051109","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1677981/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov model-based packet loss concealment for voice over IP","sourcePdf":"01677981.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155937S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"35293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"35293","articleId":"1677981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1677983,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The approach is tailored to very long adaptive filters and highly auto-correlated input signals as they arise in wideband full-duplex audio applications. The EMDF algorithm allows an attractive tradeoff between the well-known multidelay filter and the recursive least-squares algorithm. It exhibits fast convergence, superior tracking capabilities of the signal statistics, and very low delay. The low computational complexity of the conventional frequency-domain adaptive algorithms can be maintained thanks to efficient fast realizations. We also show how this approach can be combined efficiently with a suitable double-talk detector (DTD). We consider a corresponding extension of a recently proposed DTD based on a normalized cross-correlation vector whose performance was shown to be superior compared to other DTDs based on the cross-correlation coefficient. Since the resulting DTD also has an EMDF structure it is easy to implement, and the fast realization also carries over to the DTD scheme. Moreover, as the robustness issue during double talk is particularly crucial for fast-converging algorithms, we apply the concept of robust statistics into our extended frequency-domain approach. Due to the robust generalization of the cost function leading to a so-called M-estimator, the algorithms become inherently less sensitive to outliers, i.e., short bursts that may be caused by inevitable detection failures of a DTD. The proposed structure is also well suited for an efficient generalization to the multichannel case","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/35293/01677983.pdf","startPage":"1633","endPage":"1644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.858559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.858559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust extended multidelay filter and double-talk detector for acoustic echo cancellation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Acoustic signal detection","Detectors","Echo cancellers","Adaptive algorithm","Adaptive filters","Statistics","Frequency domain analysis","Wideband","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","audio signal processing","delay filters","echo suppression","frequency-domain analysis","signal detection","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended multidelay filter","double-talk detector","acoustic echo cancellation","adaptive filters","autocorrelated input signals","wideband full-duple audio applications","recursive least-squares algorithm","computational complexity","normalized cross-correlation vector","extended frequency-domain algorithms","m-estimator","robust statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filtering","doubletalk","echo cancellation","frequency domain","robust statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"Robust extended multidelay filter and double-talk detector for acoustic echo cancellation","volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1677983/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9051111","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust extended multidelay filter and double-talk detector for acoustic echo cancellation","sourcePdf":"01677983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072104S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"35293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"35293","articleId":"1677983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1677987,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It is impractical to create a broad-coverage parallel corpus only from dialog speech. An alternative approach is to have bilingual experts write conversational-style texts in the target domain, with translations. There is, however, a risk of losing fidelity to the actual utterances. This paper focuses on balancing a tradeoff between these two kinds of corpora through the analysis of two newly developed corpora in the travel domain: a bilingual parallel corpus with 420 K utterances and a collection of in-domain dialogs using actual S2ST systems. We found that the first corpus is effective for covering utterances in the second corpus if complimented with a small number of utterances taken from monolingual dialogs. We also found that characteristics of in-domain utterances become closer to those of the first corpus when more restrictive conditions and instructions to speakers are given. These results suggest the possibility of a bootstrap-style of development of corpora and S2ST systems, where an initial S2ST system is developed with parallel texts, and is then gradually improved with in-domain utterances collected by the system as restrictions are relaxed","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2006.878262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/35293/01677987.pdf","startPage":"1674","endPage":"1682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2006.878262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study on corpora for speech translation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677987/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study on corpora for speech translation","volume":"14","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9051115","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1677987/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study on corpora for speech translation","sourcePdf":"01677987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111663S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"35293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"35293","articleId":"1677987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1677991,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Tzung Chien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/35293/1677991/1677991-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jen-Tzung Chien (S'97\u2013A'98\u2013M'99\u2013SM'04) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1997.","He was an Instructor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, NTHU, in 1995.

This paper presents a novel approach focusing on mining long distance word associations and incorporating these features into language models based on linear interpolation and maximum entropy (ME) principles. We highlight the discovery of the associations of multiple distant words from training corpus. A mining algorithm is exploited to recursively merge the frequent word subsets and efficiently construct the set of association patterns. By combining the features of association patterns into n-gram models, the association pattern n-grams are estimated with a special realization to trigger pair n-gram where only the associations of two distant words are considered. In the experiments on Chinese language modeling, we find that the incorporation of association patterns significantly reduces the perplexities of n-gram models. The incorporation using ME outperforms that using linear interpolation. Association pattern n-gram is superior to trigger pair n-gram. The perplexities are further reduced using more association steps. Further, the proposed association pattern n-grams are not only able to elevate document classification accuracies but also improve speech recognition rates","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.858551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/35293/01677991.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.858551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35293","startPage":"1719","endPage":"1728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Association pattern language modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1677991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Association pattern language modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1677991/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9051119","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1677991/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Association pattern language modeling","sourcePdf":"01677991.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112258S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"35293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"35293","articleId":"1677991","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":1677998,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Each musical pattern is converted into a sequence of music intervals by means of a fundamental frequency tracking procedure. This sequence is subsequently presented as input to a set of variable-duration HMMs. Each one of these models has been trained to recognize patterns of a corresponding predefined class. Classification is determined based on the highest recognition probability. The new type of variable-duration hidden Markov modeling proposed in this paper results in enhanced performance because 1) it deals effectively with errors that commonly originate during the feature extraction stage, and 2) it accounts for variations due to the individual expressive performance of different instrument players. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the novel classification scheme has been employed in the context of Greek traditional music, to monophonic musical patterns of a popular instrument, the Greek traditional clarinet. Although the method is also appropriate for western-style music, Greek traditional music poses extra difficulties and makes music pattern recognition a harder task.

In fact, this is an intermediate stage in the longer-term goal of separating out at least two interweaving melodies of different sound sources from a mono file. The approach is essentially to filter the set of harmonics of each note from the mixed spectrum in each time frame of audio. A major consideration has been the separation of overlapping harmonics, and three filter designs are proposed for splitting a spectral peak into its constituent partials given the rough frequency and amplitude estimates of each partial contained within. The overall quality of separation has been good for mixes of up to seven orchestral notes and has been confirmed by measured average signal-to-residual ratios of around 10-20 dB","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1678002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","accessionNumber":"9051130","htmlLink":"/document/1678002/","displayDocTitle":"Separation of synchronous pitched notes by spectral filtering of harmonics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separation of synchronous pitched notes by spectral filtering of harmonics","sourcePdf":"01678002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062819S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"35293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"35293","articleId":"1678002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1678004,"authors":[{"name":"Guangji Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/35293/1678004/1678004-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guangji Shi (S'03) received the B.A.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 1996, the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto (UT), Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2002, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at UT.","Before joining UT, he worked in the automation industries both as a Technical Engineer and as a Software Developer.

The motivating goal is to get a quantitative measure on the importance of phase in automatic speech recognition by studying the effects of phase uncertainty on human perception. Listening tests were conducted for 18 listeners under different phase uncertainty and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. These results indicate that a small amount of phase error or uncertainty does not affect the recognition rate, but a large amount of phase uncertainty significantly affects the recognition rate. The degree of the importance of phase also seems to be an SNR-dependent one, such that at lower SNRs the effects of phase uncertainty are more pronounced than at higher SNRs. For example, at an SNR of -10 dB, having random phases at all frequencies results in a word error rate (WER) of 63% compared to 24% if the phase was unaltered. In comparison, at 0 dB, random phase results in a 25% WER as compared to 11% for the unaltered phase case. Listening tests were also conducted for the case of reconstructed phase based on the least square error estimation approach. The results indicate that the recognition rate for the reconstructed phase case is very close to that of the perfect phase case (a WER difference of 4% on average)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1678004/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9051132","htmlLink":"/document/1678004/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the importance of phase in human speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the importance of phase in human speech recognition","sourcePdf":"01678004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050896S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"35293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"35293","articleId":"1678004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1678005,"authors":[{"name":"D.P.

A static fatigue model that captures the static relationships between fatigue, significant factors that cause fatigue, and various sensory observations that typically result from fatigue is first presented. Such a model provides mathematically coherent and sound basis for systematically aggregating uncertain evidences from different sources, augmented with relevant contextual information. The static model, however, fails to capture the dynamic aspect of fatigue. Fatigue is a cognitive state that is developed over time. To account for the temporal aspect of human fatigue, the static fatigue model is extended based on dynamic Bayesian networks. The dynamic fatigue model allows to integrate fatigue evidences not only spatially but also temporally, therefore, leading to a more robust and accurate fatigue modeling and inference. A real-time nonintrusive fatigue monitor was built based on integrating the proposed fatigue model with a computer vision system developed for extracting various visual cues typically related to fatigue.

Existing approaches for dealing with different preference formats tend to be unwieldy. This paper proposes a new method to solve the problem, in which the preference information on alternatives provided by experts can be represented in four different formats, namely: 1) utility values; 2) preference orderings; 3) multiplicative preference relations; and 4) fuzzy preference relations. An optimization model is constructed to integrate the four formats of preference and to assess ranking values of alternatives. The model is shown to be theoretically sound and complete via a series of theorems, and then a corresponding algorithm is developed. A numerical example is given to illustrate the procedure. The proposed approach is more efficient and simpler than existing approaches because it does not need to unify different formats of preferences or to aggregate individual preferences into a collective one. Therefore, it overcomes a major shortcoming of existing approaches that lose or distort the original preference information in the process of unifying the formats","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/35294/01678018.pdf","startPage":"876","endPage":"889","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2005.855776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2005.855776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1678018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimization approach to multiperson decision making based on different formats of preference information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision making","Aggregates","Educational programs","Information analysis","Education","Management information systems","Engineering management","Research and development","Government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","optimisation","utility theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiperson decision making","preference information","decision analysis","utility values","preference orderings","multiplicative preference relations","fuzzy preference relations","optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternative ranking","fuzzy preference relations","multiperson decision making (MPDM)","multiplicative preference relations","optimization model","preference orderings","utility values"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1678018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2006","displayDocTitle":"An optimization approach to multiperson decision making based on different formats of preference information","volume":"36","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1678018/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9038086","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimization approach to multiperson decision making based on different formats of preference information","sourcePdf":"01678018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132384S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"35294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"35294","articleId":"1678018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":1678026,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangqian Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/35294/1678026/1678026-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiangqian Wu (M'06) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in 1997, 1999, and 2004, respectively.","In 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2006, he was a Research Assistant at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

The stable line features or \"palm lines\", which are comprised of principal lines and wrinkles, can be used to clearly describe a palm print and can be extracted in low-resolution images. This paper presents a novel approach to palm line extraction and matching for use in personal authentication. To extract palm lines, a set of directional line detectors is devised, and then these detectors are used to extract these lines in different directions. To avoid losing the details of the palm line structure, these irregular lines are represented using their chain code. To match palm lines, a matching score is defined between two palm prints according to the points of their palm lines. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively discriminate between palm prints even when the palm prints are dirty.

Genomic sequence, protein structure, gene expression microarrays, and gene regulatory networks are some of the application areas described.

In this paper, we describe how we can exploit this synergy by creating a seamless network of UAVs and UGVs. The keys to this are our framework and algorithms for search and localization, which are easily scalable to large numbers of UAVs and UGVs and are transparent to the specificity of individual platforms.

In cooperative communications, multiple nodes in a wireless network work together to form a virtual antenna array. Using cooperation, it is possible to exploit the spatial diversity of the traditional MIMO techniques without each node necessarily having multiple antennas. Multihop networks use some form of cooperation by enabling intermediate nodes to forward the message from source to destination. However, cooperative communication techniques described in this article are fundamentally different in that the relaying nodes can forward the information fully or in part. Also the destination receives multiple versions of the message from the source, and one or more relays and combines these to obtain a more reliable estimate of the transmitted signal as well as higher data rates.

They have found application domains in battlefield communication, homeland security, pollution sensing, and traffic monitoring. As such, there has been an increasing need to define and develop simulation frameworks for carrying out high-fidelity WSN simulation. In this article we present a modeling, simulation, and emulation framework for WSNs in J-Sim - an open source, component-based compositional network simulation environment developed entirely in Java. This framework is built on the autonomous component architecture and extensible internetworking framework of J-Sim, and provides an object-oriented definition of target, sensor, and sink nodes, sensor and wireless communication channels, and physical media such as seismic channels, mobility models, and power models (both energy-producing and energy-consuming components). Application-specific models can be defined by subclassing classes in the simulation framework and customizing their behaviors. We also include in J-Sim a set of classes and mechanisms to realize network emulation. We demonstrate the use of the proposed WSN simulation framework by implementing several well-known localization, geographic routing, and directed diffusion protocols, and perform performance comparisons (in terms of the execution time incurred and memory used) in simulating WSN scenarios in J-Sim and ns-2. The simulation study indicates the WSN framework in J-Sim is much more scalable than ns-2 (especially in memory usage). We also demonstrate the use of the WSN framework in carrying out real-life full-fledged Future Combat System (FCS) simulation and emulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1678171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1678171/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2006","accessionNumber":"9058801","volume":"13","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"J-Sim: a simulation and emulation environment for wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"J-Sim: a simulation and emulation environment for wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"01678171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074192S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"35301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"35301","articleId":"1678171","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1678188,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The algorithm is based on regression filtering using eigenvectors of the signal correlation matrix as a basis for representing clutter, a method that previously has been considered too computationally demanding for real-time processing in general CFI applications. The data acquisition and processing scheme introduced allows for a more localized sampling of the clutter statistics and, therefore, an improved clutter attenuation for lower filter orders. By using the iterative power method technique, the dominant eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the correlation matrix can be estimated efficiently, rendering real-time operation feasible on desktop computers. A new adaptive filter order algorithm is proposed that successfully estimates the proper dimension of the clutter basis, previously one of the major drawbacks of this clutter-rejection technique. The filter algorithm performance and computational demands has been compared to that of conventional clutter filters. Examples have been included which confirms that, by adapting the clutter-rejection filter to estimates of the clutter-signal statistics, improved attenuation of the clutter signal can be achieved in normal as well as more excessive cases of tissue movement and acceleration","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1678188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/35302/01678188.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1678188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35302","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time adaptive clutter rejection filtering in color flow imaging using power method iterations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1678188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time adaptive clutter rejection filtering in color flow imaging using power method iterations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1678188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9051288","pubMedId":"16964910","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1678188/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time adaptive clutter rejection filtering in color flow imaging using power method iterations","sourcePdf":"01678188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138873S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"35302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"35302","articleId":"1678188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":1678193,"authors":[{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/35302/1678193/1678193-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Faa-Jeng Lin (M'93-SM'99) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1983, 1985, and 1993, respectively.","From 1993 to 2001, he was an Associate Professor and then a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung Li, Taiwan.

A new hysteresis model by modifying and parameterizing the hysteresis friction model is proposed. Then, the overall dynamics of the piezo-actuator is completed by integrating the parameterized hysteresis model into a mechanical motion dynamics. Based on this developed dynamics, an adaptive control with hysteresis estimation and compensation is proposed. However, in the designed adaptive controller, the lumped uncertainty E is difficult to obtain in practical application. Therefore, a RFNN is adopted as an uncertainty observer in order to adapt the value of the lumped uncertainty E on line.

Currently the research work on radio channel allocation in cellular mobile systems focuses mainly on two aspects, improving the user admission capability and protecting the connection continuity for handoff calls as a QoS constraint. However, given a QoS constraint, a wireless network has to sacrifice its capacity in order to support an increase in handoff rate. In this paper, we propose and analyze a different handoff scheme which not only gives priority to handoff calls, due to importance of them from QoS standpoint, but also protects originating calls to keep system capacity at an acceptable level. We will describe the optimum design of our scheme to minimize the system cost. We use genetic algorithm (GA) to solve optimum design problem. To do so, a model of cost characteristics has been derived for the proposed scheme. Indeed, the robustness of our approach is that analytically minimizes the system cost. We use a system model defined by a two dimensional Markov chain which computes mathematically the performance in terms of the blocking probability of originating calls, forced termination probability and call incompletion probability.

Recently, a method for automatic generation of control code from a 3D simulation model of a flexible manufacturing system was developed. Finite automata and supervisory control theory (SCT) were used to guarantee the required behaviour of the system. This paper moves one step further. A method for automatic conversion between deterministic finite automata and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is presented. This allows to efficiently combine SCT and MILP to automatically generate time-optimal, collision-free and non-blocking working schedules","doi":"10.1109/WODES.2006.1678411","publicationTitle":"2006 8th International Workshop on Discrete Event Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 8th International Workshop on Discrete Event Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11086/35307/01678411.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WODES.2006.1678411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling of discrete event systems using mixed integer linear programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1678411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1678411/","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling of discrete event systems using mixed integer linear programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9063025","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1678411/","conferenceDate":"10-12 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling of discrete event systems using mixed integer linear programming","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"01678411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083786S","chronDate":"10-12 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11086","isNumber":"35307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11086","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"35307","articleId":"1678411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1678501,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Analysis of location data showed that car drivers often participate in a typical spatio-temporal motion patterns. Precision of location prediction and thus client-server tracking communications can be improved by learning such motion patterns. Paper proposes a novel approach to make predictions about where to the driver will turn at the crossroad as these are the points where trajectory can be branched in the road network environment. Approach applies artificial neural networks(ANN) which are used to learn temporal patterns of crossroad passing and predict transitions through the crossroad. Several neural networks' structures are presented and analyzed, also ANN based method is compared to statistical techniques. Proof of concept of the proposed prediction method was analyzed using real and artificial data sets. The potential of the crossroad passing prediction is discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1678501/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9055910","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1678501/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2006","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of crossroad passing using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of crossroad passing using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Vilnius, Lithuania","sourcePdf":"01678501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132829S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11087","isNumber":"35308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11087","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"35308","articleId":"1678501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"}]
