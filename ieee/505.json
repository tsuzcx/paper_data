In light of differences in optical flow fields generated by movements of two-dimensional planes and three-dimensional objects, we proposed a new liveness detection method for face recognition. Under the assumption that the test region is a two-dimensional plane, we can obtain a reference field from the actual optical flow field data. Then the degree of differences between the two fields can be used to distinguish between a three-dimensional face and a two-dimensional photograph.

How to automatically determine an optimal threshold is one of difficult points of edge detection. In this paper, Sobel edge detection operator and its improved algorithm are first discussed in term of optimal thresholding. Then based on genetic algorithms and improved Sobel operator, a new automatic threshold algorithm for images processing is proposed. Finally, the edge detection experiments of two real images are conducted by means of two algorithms. The comparative experiment results show that the new algorithm of automatic threshold is very effective. The results are also better than the classical Otsu methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Genetic algorithms","Image processing","Image color analysis","Image texture analysis","Data mining","Computer vision","Computer errors","Image generation","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","edge detection","genetic algorithms","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","computer vision","image processing","Sobel operator","genetic algorithm","automatic image threshold algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge Detection","Sobel Operator","Genetic Algorithms","Classes Square Error","Image Processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054605","doi":"10.1109/IASP.2009.5054605","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976857/5054562/05054605.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IASP.2009.5054605","startPage":"31","endPage":"35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054562","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge detection of images based on improved Sobel operator and genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Edge detection of images based on improved Sobel operator and genetic algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054605/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 April 2009","conferenceDate":"11-12 April 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054605/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10685116","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge detection of images based on improved Sobel operator and genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Linhai, China","sourcePdf":"0708E.doc.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057272S","chronDate":"11-12 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976857","isNumber":"5054562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976857","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5054562","articleId":"5054605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5054615,"authors":[{"name":"Yuefen Chen","affiliation":["College of Physics & Electronic Engineering, Taizhou University, Taizhou, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yuefen Chen","id":"37311252500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3987-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-0110"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-0129"}],"articleNumber":"5054615","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"abstract":"Sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO) is one of the main drawbacks in OFDM system.

Recent results in compressive sensing (CS) have shown that when the signal we are trying to acquire is sparse and the measurements are incoherent, the signal can be reconstructed reliably from an incomplete set of measurements. However, the signal recovery is an involved process, usually requiring the solution of an lscr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n minimization program.

The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of the optimal power allocation between the two constituent systems in order to maximize the overall signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR).","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054693","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054693.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing power allocation in analog joint source-channel coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054693","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054693/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing power allocation in analog joint source-channel coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685198","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054693/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing power allocation in analog joint source-channel coding","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046871S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5054696,"authors":[{"name":"Kejing Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, USA"],"lastName":"Kejing Liu","id":"38274715100"},{"name":"Javier Garcia-Frias","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, USA"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Garcia-Frias","id":"38274987800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054696","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of LDGM-based quantum codes","abstract":"We study the error floor performance of a proposed family of LDGM-based quantum codes.

The root cause of this degradation is the inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) introduced by the excessive multipath delay. Generally, MIMO beamforming is helpful in mitigating such interference because it can spatially suppress some of the multipath. However, the effectiveness of this suppression is very limited. In this paper, we propose an ICI/ISI aware beamforming algorithm which explicitly takes into account the multipath characteristic of the channel. Optimal steering vectors are derived to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). This technique not only achieves the beamforming benefit, but also significantly mitigates the ICI and ISI. We show, via simulations, that the proposed algorithm can dramatically reduce the block error rate, permitting good performance for channel delay profiles that would break conventional links. This is vitally important for the extension of indoor WLAN designs to outdoor uses.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054699","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054699.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICI/ISI aware beamforming for MIMO-OFDM wireless system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054699","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054699/","displayDocTitle":"ICI/ISI aware beamforming for MIMO-OFDM wireless system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685204","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054699/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICI/ISI aware beamforming for MIMO-OFDM wireless system","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07116S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054700,"authors":[{"name":"Qian He","affiliation":["EE Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Qian He","id":"37308640100"},{"name":"Rick S.

The randomness in the sensor locations randomizes the relative positions of subsidiary peaks of the ambiguity function.

On a given frequency channel, a secondary user can perform spectrum sensing to determine spatial or temporal opportunities for spectrum reuse. Whereas most prior works address either spatial or temporal sensing in isolation, we propose a joint spatial-temporal spectrum sensing scheme, which exploits information from spatial sensing to improve the performance of temporal sensing. Our simulation results show that the proposed joint spatial-temporal approach significantly outperforms existing temporal sensing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054703","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054703.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054703","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","startPage":"124","endPage":"129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint spatial-temporal spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054703","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint spatial-temporal spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054703/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054703/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685208","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint spatial-temporal spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063005S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5054704,"authors":[{"name":"Wenkai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"lastName":"Wenkai Wang","id":"37087561148"},{"name":"Husheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN"],"lastName":"Husheng Li","id":"37087074095"},{"name":"Yan Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37065670800"},{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer Engineering University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Zhu Han","id":"37087193640"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054704","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":712},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054704","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Cognitive radio","Security","Power system modeling","Detection algorithms","Degradation","Biomedical computing","Computer networks","Biomedical engineering","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","signal detection","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attack-proof collaborative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","probability","collaborative secondary users","malicious user detection algorithm","primary user detection","receiver operating characteristic","ROC curves"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collaborative Sensing","Cognitive Radios","Security"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054704","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054704.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attack-proof collaborative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Collaborative sensing in cognitive radio networks can significantly improve the probability of detecting the transmission of primary users. In current collaborative sensing schemes, all collaborative secondary users are assumed to be honest. As a consequence, the system is vulnerable to attacks in which malicious secondary users report false detection results. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the security of collaborative sensing. Particularly, we develop a malicious user detection algorithm that calculates the suspicious level of secondary users based on their past reports. Then, we calculate trust values as well as consistency values that are used to eliminate the malicious users' influence on the primary user detection results. Through simulations, we show that even a single malicious user can significantly degrade the performance of collaborative sensing. The proposed trust value indicator can effectively differentiate honest and malicious secondary users. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the primary user detection demonstrate the improvement in the security of collaborative sensing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054704/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10685209","publicationDate":"March 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054704/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Attack-proof collaborative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attack-proof collaborative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061677S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5054705,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Tajer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Tajer","id":"38577078800"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaodong Wang","id":"37281375000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054705","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"abstract":"Opportunistic allocation of resources to the best link in large multiuser networks offers considerable improvement in spectral efficiency, which is often referred to as multiuser diversity gain and can be cast as double logarithmic growth of the network throughput with the number of users. In this paper we consider large decentralized cognitive networks granted concurrent spectrum access with license-holding users. We assume that the primary network affords to accommodate one secondary user per any under-utilized spectrum band and seek allocating such spectrum bands to a subset of the existing secondary users. We first consider the optimal spectrum-secondary user pairing, which is supervised by a central entity fully aware of the instantaneous channel conditions, and show that the throughput of the cognitive network scales double logarithmically with the number of secondary users (N) and linearly with the number of available spectrum bands (M), i.e. M log log N. Next, we propose a distributed spectrum allocation scheme, which does not necessitate a central controller or any information exchange between different secondary users and obeys the optimal throughput scaling law. This scheme requires that some secondary transmitter-receiver pairs exchange log M information bits among themselves. We also show that the aggregate amount of information exchange between secondary transmitter-receiver secondary pairs is also asymptotically equal to M log M. Finally, we show that our distributed scheme, also guarantees fairness among the secondary users, meaning that they are equally likely to get access to an available spectrum band.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054705.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser diversity gain in cognitive networks with distributed spectrum access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity methods","Throughput","Interference","Resource management","Base stations","Optimal control","Centralized control","Aggregates","Cognitive radio","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","diversity reception","frequency allocation","multiuser channels","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser diversity","cognitive radio network","distributed spectrum access scheme","resource allocation","spectral efficiency","instantaneous channel condition","logM information exchange"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","distributed","fairness","multiuser diversity","spectrum allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser diversity gain in cognitive networks with distributed spectrum access","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054705/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685210","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser diversity gain in cognitive networks with distributed spectrum access","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079496S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054713,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Houston, Houston, TX"],"lastName":"Jia Meng","id":"37411340700"},{"name":"Husheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN"],"lastName":"Husheng Li","id":"37311296400"},{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Houston, Houston, TX"],"lastName":"Zhu Han","id":"37278605300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054713","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1380},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Event detection","Wireless sensor networks","Image coding","Sampling methods","Signal processing algorithms","Gaussian noise","Signal sampling","Image processing","Bayesian methods","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","signal detection","signal sampling","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse event detection","wireless sensor network","compressive sensing algorithm","signal sampling","Bayesian detection"]}],"abstract":"Compressive sensing is a revolutionary idea proposed recently to achieve much lower sampling rate for sparse signals. For large wireless sensor networks, the events are relatively sparse compared with the number of sources. Because of deployment cost, the number of sensors is limited, and due to energy constraint, not all the sensors are turned on all the time. In this paper, the first contribution is to formulate the problem for sparse event detection in wireless sensor networks as a compressive sensing problem. The number of (wake-up) sensors can be greatly reduced to the similar level of the number of sparse events, which is much smaller than the total number of sources. Second, we suppose the event has the binary nature, and employ the Bayesian detection using this prior information. Finally, we analyze the performance of the compressive sensing algorithms under the Gaussian noise. From the simulation results, we show that the sampling rate can reduce to 25% without sacrificing performance. With further decreasing the sampling rate, the performance is gradually reduced until 10% of sampling rate.

Narrow pulses are required for high precision of positioning, thus demanding high sampling rate. To alleviate the difficulty for analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and utilize the feature of time sparsity of UWB pulses, a compressed sensing based scheme is proposed, in which the received signal is mixed using distributed amplifiers, sampled using a bank of low rate ADCs and then reconstructed. To combat the detrimental effect of Gaussian noise, Bayesian compressed sensing is applied, using a structure similar to the iterative decoder for turbo codes to exploit the redundancy in time, history and space. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the Bayesian compressed sensing using redundancy achieves substantial performance gain (UWB pulse recovery rate and positioning precision), compared with traditional compressed sensing approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054715.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"197","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UWB signal acquisition in positioning systems: Bayesian compressed sensing with redundancy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Compressed sensing","Pulse amplifiers","Pulse compression methods","Ultra wideband technology","Timing","Sampling methods","Analog-digital conversion","Distributed amplifiers","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","Bayes methods","distributed amplifiers","Gaussian noise","iterative decoding","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB signal acquisition","positioning systems","Bayesian compressed sensing","ultrawideband positioning systems","analog-to-digital converters","ADC","distributed amplifiers","Gaussian noise","numerical simulation","substantial performance gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"UWB signal acquisition in positioning systems: Bayesian compressed sensing with redundancy","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054715/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685220","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB signal acquisition in positioning systems: Bayesian compressed sensing with redundancy","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066554S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054716,"authors":[{"name":"Depeng Yang","affiliation":["Min Kao Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Depeng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37311599800"},{"name":"Husheng Li","affiliation":["Min Kao Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Husheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37311296400"},{"name":"Gregory D.

The nature and amount of video content is another challenge that further complicates WSN data reliability problem. Motivated by the aforementioned factors, in this work, we propose an architecture that promises to enhance received video quality along-with sensor network lifetime maximization using a three prong strategy: splitting source coded video into prioritized streams, use path diversity to route video packets and partially and progressively decode the data packets as they traverse the multi-hop network. Further intrigued by quality enhancement for received video, we apply our proposed framework to an actual video sequence and compare the benefits that can be achieved using multipath multi-stream distributed reliability (MMDR) framework that we propose. We show that with little bit of processing within the network, significant enhancements in quality of video can be achieved for same level of energy spent to deliver video over the end-to-end path. We propose selective budgeting of network energy resources for processing within the network. We use low density parity check (LDPC) codes for channel coding the video sensor data. We show that the proposed architecture outperforms prevalent end-to-end channel coding schemes by considerable margins. Further, based on the results achieved, we discuss the associated rate-distortion tradeoffs in design of video sensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054718","startPage":"207","endPage":"212","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054718.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath multi-stream distributed reliable video delivery in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multipath multi-stream distributed reliable video delivery in Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054718/","accessionNumber":"10685223","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054718/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath multi-stream distributed reliable video delivery in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079691S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5054725,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Luen Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng-Luen","lastName":"Wei","id":"37309427800"},{"name":"John J.

Traditional localization techniques can be applied to multiple transmitter localization, provided that: (1) the total number of cochannel transmitters in the system is known, and (2) an appropriate set of clustered measurements is available. In this paper, we present two criteria to determine the total number of cochannel transmitters in the primary system. The first criterion is called the net MMSE criterion, which uses the Cramer-Rao lower bound on localization accuracy. The second criterion is the information theoretic criterion, minimum description length. Both of these criteria lead to measurement clustering algorithms in a natural way. Although we consider only signal strength measurements, the approach can be generalized to include other types of observations (e.g., time and angle information) with independent measurements in additive noise. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to measurement clustering.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement clustering criteria for localization of multiple transmitters","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054742","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054742.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054742","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Measurement clustering criteria for localization of multiple transmitters","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054742/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685247","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement clustering criteria for localization of multiple transmitters","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054225S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5054743,"authors":[{"name":"Chinmay S.

The case of FDPC with positive definite (p.d.) input covariance matrix was studied by the authors in a recent paper, and here the more general case of positive semi-definite (p.s.d.) input covariance is dealt with. Towards this end, the choice of auxiliary random variable is modified. The algorithms for determination of inflation factor proposed in the p.d. case are then generalized to the case of p.s.d. input covariance. Subsequently, the largest DPC-achievable high-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) scaling factor over the no-CSIT FDPC with p.s.d. input covariance matrix is derived. This scaling factor is seen to be a non-trivial generalization of the one achieved for the p.d. case. Next, in the limit of low SNR, it is proved that the choice of all-zero inflation factor (thus treating interference as noise) is optimal in the dasiaratiopsila sense, regardless of the covariance matrix used. Further, in the p.d. covariance case, the inflation factor optimal at high SNR is obtained when the number of transmit antennas is greater than the number of receive antennas, with the other case having been already considered in the earlier paper. Finally, the problem of joint optimization of the input covariance matrix and the inflation factor is dealt with, and an iterative numerical algorithm is developed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","startPage":"346","endPage":"351","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054743.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the achievable rate of the fading dirty paper channel with imperfect CSIT","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5054743/","displayDocTitle":"On the achievable rate of the fading dirty paper channel with imperfect CSIT","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685248","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the achievable rate of the fading dirty paper channel with imperfect CSIT","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108607S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054750,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangfang Li","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangfang","lastName":"Li","id":"37311139400"},{"name":"Lijun Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, Prairie View, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Qian","id":"37286871700"},{"name":"Deepak Kataria","affiliation":["Advanced Networking & Systems, HCL America, Florham Park, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Kataria","id":"37319730800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054750","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":106,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1304},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054750","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Power control","Macrocell networks","Quality of service","Base stations","Interchannel interference","Telecommunication traffic","Internet","Signal to noise ratio","Energy management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","cochannel interference","interference suppression","power control","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication congestion control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink power control problem","macrocell Femtocell overlay","interference mitigation","quality-of-service","fundamental capacity limitation","spatial spectrum sharing","co-channel interference","centralized solution","distributed solution","heterogeneous cells","joint power control","channel management","admission control procedure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054750","endPage":"388","startPage":"383","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054750.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink power control in co-channel macrocell femtocell overlay","abstract":"In this paper, interference mitigation through downlink power control is considered for macrocell Femtocell overlay. Specifically, the strong interference in the downlink from the home base station to a nearby macrocell user should be properly controlled such that the quality-of-service of both the macrocell user and the Femtocell users can be guaranteed. In this work, the fundamental capacity limitation of spatial spectrum sharing among a macrocell user and a Femtocell user is identified. A downlink power control problem is formulated to address the co-channel interference, as well as provide quality-of-service to both the macrocell user and the Femtocell users. The feasibility condition of the problem is derived and both centralized and distributed solutions are provided. Because the co-channel interference are from heterogeneous cells, a joint power control, channel management and admission control procedure is suggested such that the priority of the macrocell users is always ensured.

Although the optimal scheme is difficult to obtain, we propose a sub-optimal beamforming scheme where the beamforming vectors are selected by the feedback. The Base station (BS) broadcasts the optimal index of the code vectors in the codebook to the users. With optimal quatization of CSI and only a small number of feedback bits, the required average sum-power is shown to be close to or even smaller than the sub-optimal maximum eigenmode beamforming (MEB) scheme where perfect CSI is known at the users. To simplify the performance analysis, we use a sub-optimal quantization scheme for the proposed beamforming scheme, where the distance between the code vectors and the strongest eigen-channel vectors of the users is minimized. Although the sub-optimal quantization scheme has a higher sum-power than the optimal one, simulation results show that they achieve similar multi-user gain. By letting the feedback bits approach infinity, this sub-optimal quantization scheme becomes the MEB scheme. A closed-form expression for the sum-power of this sub-optimal quantization scheme is estimated by random matrix theory and quantization bounds on Grassmann manifold. The effect of the finite-rate feedback on multi-user gain is then studied using this closed-form expression.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054770","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054770.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power minimization of multiaccess MIMO systems with rate constraint and finite-rate feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054770","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054770/","displayDocTitle":"Power minimization of multiaccess MIMO systems with rate constraint and finite-rate feedback","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685275","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054770/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power minimization of multiaccess MIMO systems with rate constraint and finite-rate feedback","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066326S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054771,"authors":[{"name":"Raphael Hunger","affiliation":["Associate Institute of Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Hunger","id":"37285557900"},{"name":"Michael Joham","affiliation":["Associate Institute of Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Joham","id":"37285062400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054771","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Maximum likelihood detection","Covariance matrix","Fading","Nonlinear filters","Filtering","Receiving antennas","Signal analysis","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast channels","channel coding","filtering theory","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO broadcast channel","linear filtering","multiantenna terminal","weighted sum rate maximization problem","dual multiple access channel","channel matrices","closed form expressions","block-diagonalization","optimum transmit strategy","asymptotic analysis","multiple input multiple output systems"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the MIMO broadcast channel with multi-antenna terminals in the high SNR regime when linear filtering is applied instead of dirty paper coding. Using a recent rate duality where the streams of every single user are not treated as self-interference as in the hitherto existing stream-wise rate dualities for linear filtering, we solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem of the broadcast channel in the dual multiple access channel. Thus, we can exactly quantify the asymptotic rate loss of linear filtering compared to dirty paper coding for any channel realization. We come up with the first rate loss expression that only depends on the channel matrices of all users and not on the precoders of the users as hitherto existing results for multi-antenna terminals do. Having converted the optimum covariance matrices to the broadcast channel by means of the duality, we observe that the optimal covariance matrices in the broadcast channel feature quite complicated but still closed form expressions although the respective transmit covariance matrices in the dual multiple access channel share a very simple structure. We immediately come to the conclusion that block-diagonalization is the asymptotically optimum transmit strategy in the broadcast channel. Out of the set of block-diagonalizing precoders, we present the one which achieves the largest sum rate and thus corresponds to the optimum solution found in the dual multiple access channel. Additionally, we quantify the ergodic rate loss of linear coding compared to dirty paper coding for Gaussian channels with correlations at the mobiles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An asymptotic analysis of the MIMO broadcast channel under linear filtering","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054771","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054771.pdf","startPage":"494","endPage":"499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054771","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"An asymptotic analysis of the MIMO broadcast channel under linear filtering","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054771/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685276","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An asymptotic analysis of the MIMO broadcast channel under linear filtering","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077503S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5054772,"authors":[{"name":"Hyosung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"lastName":"Hyosung Kim","id":"37310767700"},{"name":"Jitendra K.

With antenna grouping, we can achieve diversity gain through beamforming, and high spectral efficiency through spatial multiplexing simultaneously. In an IID channel, at a fixed transmission rate, we can get better BER performance by antenna grouping compared with beamforming. But if the channel is ill-conditioned or there is some correlation between transmit or receive antennas, the BER performance of antenna grouping is significantly degraded. In that case, beamforming is better than antenna grouping algorithm. We introduced existing antenna grouping algorithms and proposed our new simple antenna grouping algorithms in our previous paper. In this paper, we investigate mode selection algorithms which select antenna grouping or beamforming mode. By selecting a suitable mode for instantaneous channel, we can prevent fluctuation of BER performance caused by channel variation and antenna correlation. We introduce some existing mode selection criteria and also propose a new criterion which is derived from the simple antenna grouping algorithm in the previous paper. This proposed mode selection criterion requires little additional calculations. By comparing with existing mode selection criteria, we verify the performance of our criterion.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054773","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054773.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode selection between antenna grouping and beamforming for MIMO communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054773","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054773/","displayDocTitle":"Mode selection between antenna grouping and beamforming for MIMO communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685278","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054773/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode selection between antenna grouping and beamforming for MIMO communication systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058119S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5054774,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Xiao","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Colorado Boulder, USA"],"lastName":"Jun Xiao","id":"37309581200"},{"name":"Youjian Liu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Colorado Boulder, USA"],"lastName":"Youjian Liu","id":"37279421300"},{"name":"Wen Gao","affiliation":["Thomson, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Wen Gao","id":"37275736600"},{"name":"An Liu","affiliation":["School of EECS, Peking University, China"],"lastName":"An Liu","id":"37402452900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054774","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","MIMO","Relays","Algorithm design and analysis","Iterative algorithms","Decoding","Channel state information","State feedback","Transmitters","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","precoding","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","MIMO orthogonal relay channels","finite-rate feedback","multiple antennas","half duplex relay channels","partial channel state information","on-off preceding","Grassmann manifolds"]}],"abstract":"Multiple antennas and relay can improve spectral efficiency of a network. Half duplex relay channels employing decode-and-forward and total power constraint are considered in this work. The resource includes power and time for the receive and transmit stages of the relay. Resource allocation algorithm is designed in order to maximize an achievable rate. The source and the relay nodes are assumed to have partial channel state information (CSI) obtained through finite-rate feedback from relay and/or destination. The full-blown problem is stated and the result of a special case of orthogonal transmission is presented. The transmitters use the simple power on/off precoding with constant number of on-beams while the precoding matrices are chosen according to quantization on Grassmann manifolds. An earlier analytical result on finite rate feedback is employed in the resource allocation algorithm. The complicated expressions of the achievable rates and the non-convexity of the problem make the optimal resource allocations hard to obtain and analyze. Iterative and near optimal resource allocation algorithm is presented. Numerical results are provided to show the benefits of finiterate feedback by comparison of the achievable rates of the relay channel, two-hop transmission and the direct transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation for MIMO orthogonal relay channels with finite-rate feedback","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054774","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054774.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054774","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for MIMO orthogonal relay channels with finite-rate feedback","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054774/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685279","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for MIMO orthogonal relay channels with finite-rate feedback","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06597S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5054775,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Zhang","id":"37087173341"},{"name":"Xiaoli Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaoli Ma","id":"37087166973"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054775","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054775","abstract":"To cope with the deleterious channel fading effects on the system performance, diversity-enriched transmitters and receivers have well-appreciated merits. When the channel state information is available at the transmitter, precoders are designed to suppress the channel effect and enable the diversity and low-complexity receiver designs. In addition, the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) issue has to be considered from the energy perspective. In this paper, after reviewing existing precoding designs by providing the diversity and PAR results, we present a low-complexity transceiver design with a geometric mean decomposition based precoder at the transmitter and a novel lattice reduction aided equalizer at the receiver. The performance is analyzed in terms of diversity and the PAR.

Before the iterative detection and decoding starts, a modified hard decision sphere decoder produces a short (base) list of vectors with maximum likelihood metrics. In subsequent iterative soft detections, two competing lists with a small number of vectors are further generated for each coded bit, by utilizing the base list vectors and a priori information from the channel decoder. The corresponding likelihood metrics of the vectors in each competing list are combined to produce soft detection output that approximates the optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution. The performance improves as the base list size increases and a short list (hence a low number of competing vectors) can provide near-capacity performance after a few iterations. Compared with existing methods that adopt the max-log approximation and select only a single best competing vector, the proposed algorithm approaches the optimal performance better with significantly lower complexity requirements.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054776","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054776.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054776","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","startPage":"524","endPage":"527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-capacity performance soft output sphere decoding based on short list detection and metrics combining","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054776","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Near-capacity performance soft output sphere decoding based on short list detection and metrics combining","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054776/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054776/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685281","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-capacity performance soft output sphere decoding based on short list detection and metrics combining","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054114S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054779,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Iannello","affiliation":["CWCSPR, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Iannello","id":"37317492300"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["CWCSPR, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054779","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Relays","Protocols","Upper bound","Decoding","Lattices","AWGN","Fading","Code standards","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","channel coding","decoding","fading channels","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-way relay channel","quasistatic fading channel","type-I HARQ strategies","protocols","decode-and-forward techniques","lattice code-based strategies","partial channel state information","amplify-and-forward techniques"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054779","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054779.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput analysis of type-I HARQ strategies in Two-Way Relay Channels","abstract":"A Two-Way Relay Channels (TWRC) is studied over quasi-static fading channels by focusing on the throughput of Type-I HARQ strategies.

Another source of performance-limiting ICI, but with a different nature, in OFDM systems is Doppler spread due to mobility. Unlike previous work which considered these two problems separately, we develop a generalized analytical framework to characterize, estimate and jointly mitigate ICI due to both I/Q imbalance and high mobility. Based on our general model, we exploit the special ICI structure to design efficient channel and I/Q imbalance parameter estimation and digital baseband compensation schemes for joint transmit/receive frequency-independent and frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance under high-mobility conditions. Moreover, we extend the model, compensation and channel estimation methods to the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) case, spatial multiplexing (SM) in particular.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054780","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054780.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","startPage":"545","endPage":"550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital baseband compensation of joint TX/RX frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance in mobile MIMO-OFDM transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054780","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital baseband compensation of joint TX/RX frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance in mobile MIMO-OFDM transceivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054780/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685285","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5054780/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital baseband compensation of joint TX/RX frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance in mobile MIMO-OFDM transceivers","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053029S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5054782,"authors":[{"name":"Meilong Jiang","affiliation":["Broadband and Mobile Networks, NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Meilong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37305719600"},{"name":"Narayan Prasad","affiliation":["Broadband and Mobile Networks, NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Narayan","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37284625900"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Columbia University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054782","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Decision feedback equalizers","MIMO","National electric code","Peak to average power ratio","Transmitters","Demodulation","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna arrays","cellular radio","decision feedback equalisers","discrete Fourier transforms","frequency division multiple access","Monte Carlo methods","radio links","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFT-spread-OFDMA systems","uplink access scheme","cellular systems","3GPP long term evolution","peak-to-average-power ratio","DFT operation","OFDM modulator","transmission reliability","linear minimum mean square error","iterative block decision feedback equalizer","Monte Carlo simulations","multiple antennas"]}],"abstract":"DFT-spread-OFDMA (DFT-S-OFDMA) technique has been adopted as the uplink access scheme in emerging cellular systems such as the 3GPP long term evolution (3GPP-LTE), in order to reduce the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR). In this scheme, data symbols are pre-coded using a DFT operation at the transmitter before being sent to the OFDM modulator. Moreover, emerging cellular systems will also deploy multiple antennas at the base-station to increase the transmission reliability and/or system capacity. The design of low-complexity, low-latency and high-performance receivers for such DFT-S-OFDMA systems is an important open problem that has hitherto received little attention. In this paper, three receivers are proposed and examined for such DFT-S-OFDMA systems, which include a highly efficient group soft demodulator (referred to as the GMLSD), an enhanced iterative block decision feedback equalizer (IBDFE) and the conventional linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) receiver. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the performance of the proposed receiver algorithms. It is shown that the GMLSD receiver is ideal for the DFT-S-OFDMA based systems due to its low complexity and superior performance.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054782","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054782.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of efficient receivers for DFT-S-OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054782","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054782/","displayDocTitle":"Design of efficient receivers for DFT-S-OFDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685287","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054782/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of efficient receivers for DFT-S-OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045125S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054783,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Wei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ming-Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37307895400"},{"name":"John F.

mitigate the scarcity of radio spectrum incurred by the proliferation and evolution of wireless devices. In order to accomplish a more efficient spectrum utilization across time, space and frequency, the functionality of spectral awareness is expected to be incorporated into transceivers of cognitive radios (CR) in the foreseeable future. However, the agility requirements imposed on an individual CR might be very stringent since the spectrum has to be monitored on a continuous basis and the spectral holes must be detected reliably in the presence of channel fading and/or hardware failure, especially in a broadband wireless network with multiple primary users. To remedy this problem, light-weight collaboration among CRs becomes attractive since distributed signal processing can exploit the spatial diversity through network cooperation to improve the sensing reliability. To this end, we extend the classical framework for distributed detection of a single user to the case of multiuser detection, and introduce a Tanner graph description of the network topology. We designate the transmission pattern of primaries by a binary space-frequency signature sequence and view all possible patterns collectively as a low-density parity check (LDPC) codebook. Then, we invoke belief propagation message passing algorithm across the entire CR network to infer the unknown pattern iteratively from the noisy observations of all spectrum sensors. Based on the pattern inferred, the fusion centers can determine the spectral and spatial access pattern of secondary users, without interfering with the normal functioning of incumbent primaries.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054784","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054784.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative sensing of primary users in cognitive radio networks based on message passing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054784","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054784/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative sensing of primary users in cognitive radio networks based on message passing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685289","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054784/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative sensing of primary users in cognitive radio networks based on message passing","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063755S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5054785,"authors":[{"name":"Tariq Elkourdi","affiliation":["CWSPER, ECE Department New Jersey Institute of Technology, University of Heights, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Tariq","lastName":"Elkourdi","id":"37316903500"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["CWSPER, ECE Department New Jersey Institute of Technology, University of Heights, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054785","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mercury (metals)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary MAC cooperation","spectrum sharing","cognitive radio networks","multichannel cognitive radio networks","cooperative secondary strategies"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of secondary MAC cooperation on spectrum sharing in cognitive readio networks","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","endPage":"578","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054785","startPage":"574","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054785","abstract":"In this paper, the impact of secondary MAC cooperation on the sum-throughput of multichannel cognitive radio networks is studied.

We replace the dirty paper coding (DPC) used in the cognitive radio with full CSIT by the linear assignment Gel'fand-Pinsker coding (LA-GPC), which can utilize the limited knowledge of the channel more efficiently. Based on the achievable rate derived from the LA-GPC, two optimization problems under the fast and slow fading channels are formulated. We then derive semi-analytical solutions to the relaying ratios and precoding coefficients of these two problems. Simulation results show that the proposed semi-analytical solutions perform close to the optimal solutions found by brute-force search, and outperform the systems base on naive DPC. Asymptotic analysis also shows that these solutions converge to the optimal ones solved with full CSIT when the K-factor of Rician channels approaches infinity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054787/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10685292","publicationDate":"March 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054787/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of the cognitive radio with partial channel state information at the transmitter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of the cognitive radio with partial channel state information at the transmitter","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065488S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5054788,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Su","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Su","id":"37280809500"},{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279333400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054788","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054788","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiple access","Cognitive radio","Scheduling algorithm","Media Access Protocol","Ubiquitous computing","Wireless application protocol","Access protocols","Fading","Cross layer design","Queueing analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","fading channels","frequency allocation","probability","queueing theory","scheduling","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary user friendly TDMA networks","primary users","cognitive radio networks","wireless spectrum","cognitive medium access control","MAC protocols","vacant-channel probability","wireless time division multiple access","wireless fading channel","cross-layer design technique","packet scheduling scheme","queuing model","multiple performance metrics","packet delay","wireless spectrum utilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","cross-layer design","rate adaption","scheduling","time division multiple access (TDMA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054788","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054788.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secondary user friendly TDMA scheduling for primary users in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio technology is widely accepted as an efficient approach to solve the problem that the wireless spectrum has been getting scarcer and scarcer due to the rapid growth in the ubiquitous wireless applications. Several cognitive medium access control (MAC) protocols have been proposed for the secondary users (non-licensed users) to take advantage of the vacant channels whenever they are not occupied by the primary users (licensed users) in the wireless time division multiple access (TDMA)-based networks. In this paper, by exploiting the unique property of the wireless fading channel and cross-layer design technique, we develop a packets scheduling scheme for the primary users in the context of wireless TDMA networks, which is set up to operate friendly towards the secondary users in terms of vacant-channel probability. Our proposed scheme can be implemented with just slight modification on the traditional TDMA scheduling algorithm. We develop a rigorous queuing model and then quantitatively analyze the tradeoff among multiple performance metrics to identify when and where the cost for favoring the secondary users is worthy. The analytical results show that our proposed scheme can generate more vacant-channel opportunities for secondary users, at the expense of little increasing packet delay, as compared with the traditional wireless TDMA scheduling algorithm. In addition, since the implementation of our proposed scheme only needs little modification on the existing TDMA scheduling algorithm, our proposed scheme is a practical and cost-effective approach to increase the wireless spectrum utilization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054788/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10685293","publicationDate":"March 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054788/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Secondary user friendly TDMA scheduling for primary users in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secondary user friendly TDMA scheduling for primary users in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081735S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5054789,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Shen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Shen","id":"37289009300"},{"name":"Michael P.

Notably, this throughput advantage is obtained without sacrificing the performance of the primary user, if the interference margin is carefully chosen. The key idea is to exploit the spatial dimensions to orthogonalize users and hence minimize interference. However, unlike the time and frequency dimensions, there is no universal basis for the set of all multi-dimensional spatial channels, which motivated the development of OSO. On one hand, OSO can be viewed as a multi-user diversity scheme that exploits the channel randomness and independence. On the other hand, OSO can be interpreted as an opportunistic interference alignment scheme, where the interference from multiple secondary users is opportunistically aligned at the direction that is orthogonal to the primary user's signal space. Throughput advantages are studied both analytically and numerically.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054789.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"605","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spatial spectrum access with opportunistic orthogonalization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Chromium","Cognitive radio","Frequency domain analysis","Wireless networks","Cellular networks","Multiaccess communication","Channel capacity","Interference channels","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic spatial spectrum access","opportunistic spatial orthogonalization","system throughput","interference margin","multidimensional spatial channel","multiuser diversity scheme","cognitive radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spatial spectrum access with opportunistic orthogonalization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054789/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685294","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spatial spectrum access with opportunistic orthogonalization","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065645S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054790,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Liu","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292078900"},{"name":"Y.

In this approach, the original constellation is expanded so that each member of the new constellation inherits its components from members of the original signal set. The expanded constellation enables the relay to extract the required information in order to cooperate in the relay phase, and it helps the destination to effectively combine received signals during the broadcast phase and the relay phase.

However, because of the complexity of MIMO detection, there is considerable overhead in implementing a MIMO relay if the conventional detect-and-forward strategy is used. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cooperative partial detection (CPD) strategy that partitions the detection task between the relay and the destination. CPD leverages the structure of the tree-based close-to-ML MIMO detectors, and modifies the tree traversal so that instead of visiting all the levels of the tree, only a subset of the levels, thus a subset of the transmitted streams, are visited. This novel approach reduces the tree levels, i.e. dimensions, in both the relay and the destination. Moreover, CPD provides a flexible method to control the level of partitioning between the relay and the destination, and thus, adjust the detection computational complexity in the relay and the destination. Monte-Carlo simulation results show that, under equal transmit power and complexity constraint in the destination, CPD achieves a better BER performance compared to the non-relay scenario, with limited computational overhead in the relay.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Detectors","Computational complexity","Power system relaying","Decoding","Detection algorithms","Multimedia communication","Multimedia systems","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","computational complexity","MIMO communication","radiocommunication","telecommunication network reliability","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial detection","multiple antenna relay","wireless system","telecommunication network reliability","MIMO detection","cooperative partial detection","computational complexity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054802","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054802.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial detection for multiple antenna cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054802","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Partial detection for multiple antenna cooperation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054802/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054802/","accessionNumber":"10685307","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial detection for multiple antenna cooperation","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064885S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054803,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37304555100"},{"name":"Shalinee Kishore","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Shalinee","lastName":"Kishore","id":"37269549900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2733-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2734-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5054803","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Diversity reception","Signal to noise ratio","Testing","White spaces","Wireless sensor networks","Fading","Statistics","Detectors","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Gaussian channels","signal detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","Gaussian fusion channel","signal-to-noise ratio","asymptotic performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054803","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054803","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","abstract":"This paper presents cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks under Gaussian fusion channels.

Furthermore, asymptotic performance is investigated assuming large numbers of secondary users and samples used for local energy calculation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","startPage":"675","endPage":"680","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054803.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks under Gaussian fusion channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5054803/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks under Gaussian fusion channels","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685308","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks under Gaussian fusion channels","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052932S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054812,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In particular, we utilize the logarithmic values of prime numbers to construct projection matrices that are capable of significant reductions in the number of observations (m) needed for the recovery of integer-valued signals when compared to leading compressed-sensing methods. At one extreme, and under ideal conditions, the proposed Log of Prime-numbers (LoP) projection enables single-observation compressed sensing, where one sample (m = 1) can be used for the recovery of a sparse signal with N original integer samples. More importantly, we design a practical LoP projection system and a corresponding low-complexity solver that only requires m = k observations, where k is the sparsity of the signal S in some space psi. We compare the performance of the proposed LoP system with popular Basis Pursuit (BP) and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) methods, and demonstrate the significant improvements that can be achieved by utilizing LoP projection matrices.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054818","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054818.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","startPage":"751","endPage":"756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical compressed sensing with log-of-prime projections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054818","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Practical compressed sensing with log-of-prime projections","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054818/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685323","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5054818/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical compressed sensing with log-of-prime projections","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067195S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054822,"authors":[{"name":"Jeannie L.

In the computation of the energy expenditure, the circuit, transmission, and retransmission energies are taken into account. A combined log-normal shadowing and Rayleigh fading model is employed to model the wireless channel. The link reliabilities and retransmission probabilities are determined through the outage probabilities under log-normal shadowing effects. Both single-hop and multi-hop transmissions are considered. Through numerical results, the optimal constellation sizes are identified. Several interesting observations with practical implications are made. It is seen that while large constellations are preferred at small transmission distances, constellation size should be decreased as the distance increases. Similar trends are observed in both fixed and variable transmit power scenarios. We have noted that variable power schemes can attain higher energy-efficiencies. The analysis of energy-efficient modulation design is also conducted in multi-hop linear networks. In this case, the modulation size and routing paths are jointly optimized, and the analysis of both the bit energy and delay experienced in the linear network is provided.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054829","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054829.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054829","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","startPage":"811","endPage":"816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient modulation design for reliable communication in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054829","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient modulation design for reliable communication in wireless networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054829/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054829/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685334","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient modulation design for reliable communication in wireless networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049488S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5054839,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Furthermore, we show that the number theoretic properties of our RIP matrices allow their products with discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices to be well approximated via a few highly sparse matrix multiplications. Hence, our RIP matrices may be approximately multiplied by the DFT of any input vector in sublinear-time by reading only a small fraction of its entries. As a consequence, we obtain small deterministic sample sets which are guaranteed to allow the recovery of near-optimal sparse Fourier representations for all periodic functions having an integrable second derivative over a single period. Explicit bounds are provided for the sizes of our RIP matrices, the sizes of their associated sublinear Fourier sampling sets, and the errors incurred by quickly approximating their products with DFT matrices. The Fourier sampling requirements obtained herein improve on previous deterministic Fourier sampling results in [1], [2].","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054839.pdf","startPage":"870","endPage":"875","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple deterministically constructible RIP matrices with sublinear fourier sampling requirements","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simple deterministically constructible RIP matrices with sublinear fourier sampling requirements","htmlLink":"/document/5054839/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10685344","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple deterministically constructible RIP matrices with sublinear fourier sampling requirements","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046456S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054843,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The numerous metallic objects found in many industrial environments can make reliable RF coverage difficult to obtain. In cases where system components are physically isolated from one another by metallic barriers (e.g. bulkheads or storage tank walls), direct RF communication between components is not possible. Prior research into the use of ultrasonic signaling as a means of passing data across metallic barriers has proven successful, but it has been observed that acoustic echoing in the channel leads to significant intersymbol interference (ISI) when symbol rate approaches the hundred kilosymbol/second range. An echo cancelation technique was developed to partially suppress these echoes, but its performance was limited due to simplicity of the channel model used. In this paper, we develop a more accurate channel model and use it as the basis for constructing an improved echo cancelation pulse. The new pulse suppresses echoes to a level comparable to the RMS noise amplitude of the channel, greatly reducing ISI. The resulting transceiver is capable of transmitting data at over 5 Mbps using simple pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). This technique thus represents a data rate increase by a factor of five over prior work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High bit rate ultrasonic communication through metal channels","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054845","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054845.pdf","startPage":"902","endPage":"906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054845","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"High bit rate ultrasonic communication through metal channels","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054845/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685350","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High bit rate ultrasonic communication through metal channels","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079513S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054846,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Keeser","affiliation":["Cypress Semiconductors, Inc., Lynnwood, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Keeser","id":"37317239800"},{"name":"Benjamin J.

The security has become a critical concern in the physical layer of the wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a novel MIMO-aided security scheme. By exploiting an extra dimension provided by MIMO systems for adding artificial noise to the transmission process, which let the attacker's signal be a degraded version of the legitimate receiver's signal, the physical-layer security is enhanced as a result. In the proposed scheme the physical-layer may rely on upper-layer encryption techniques for security, which results in a cross-layer security scheme. The control sequence in the upper-layer can use some known stream ciphers. Finally, we gave the comparison of our scheme and the traditional cryptographic system. Our scheme can provide stronger security for wireless networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976858/5054673/05054851.pdf","startPage":"935","endPage":"939","publicationTitle":"2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2009.5054851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2009.5054851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5054851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cross-layer approach to enhance the security of wireless networks based on MIMO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","MIMO","Communication system security","Cryptography","Information security","Physical layer","Broadcasting","Signal processing","Degradation","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","MIMO communication","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer approach","wireless network","security enhancement","wireless transmissions","MIMO systems","physical-layer security","upper-layer encryption techniques","cross-layer security scheme","stream ciphers","cryptographic system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5054851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A cross-layer approach to enhance the security of wireless networks based on MIMO","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5054851/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10685356","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cross-layer approach to enhance the security of wireless networks based on MIMO","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070763S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976858","isNumber":"5054673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976858","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5054673","articleId":"5054851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5054916,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick McDaniel","affiliation":["Department of computer science and engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Patrick McDaniel is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Pennsylvania State University, and is also partnering with Lockheed Martin to analyze smart grid technology.

Present theory, however, requires many more coefficients. There are now generally recognized two values each of leakage, synchronous, and transient reactance which correspond to the two symmetrical axes of magnetization of the armature current and which refer to balanced operation. Negative and zero phase-sequence reactances are also employed to determine operation under unbalanced conditions, and it is possible and desirable to distinguish other reactances. In view of the increasing complexity of the subject it is felt that a critical survey of it is in order and the object of the paper has been to provide that survey. The paper has been divided into two parts. Part I is descriptive, and treats the subject with regard to those factors which are important to application or operating engineers, and to designers. In particular, the major types of reactances which include the synchronous, transient, and phase-sequence reactances, are discussed. These quantities are defined and their methods of test outlined. It appears necessary to consider a second type of transient reactance, namely sub-transient reactance. Both reactances may be determined from short-circuit oscillograms as illustrated in the paper. A table is included which gives the numerical range of reactances for the various types of synchronous machines. Part II discusses the theoretical considerations, with a view to broadening and classifying existing conceptions of reactance.","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1928.5055010","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5054985/05055010.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1928.5055010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Reactances of Synchronous Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5055010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1928","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1928","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5055010/","displayDocTitle":"The Reactances of Synchronous Machines","volume":"47","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1928","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Reactances of Synchronous Machines","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v47-n2-25.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030656S","chronDate":"April  1928","isNumber":"5054985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"76","articleId":"5055010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1928","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5055024,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1928.5055024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1928.5055024","startPage":"617","endPage":"644","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5054985/05055024.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5054985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Certain Topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5055024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1928","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1928","displayDocTitle":"Certain Topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 1928","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Certain Topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v47-n2-39.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062924S","chronDate":"April  1928","isNumber":"5054985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"1082","articleId":"5055024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1928","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5055195,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Special detailed formulas are also developed which permit the determination of current and torque on three-phase short circuit, during starting, and when only small deviations from an average operating angle are involved. In addition, new and more accurate equivalent circuits are developed for synchronous and asynchronous machines operating in parallel, and the domain of validity of such circuits is established. Throughout, the treatment has been generalized to include salient poles and an arbitrary number of rotor circuits. The analysis is thus adapted to machines equipped with field pole collars, or with amortisseur windings of any arbitrary construction.

Analytical quantities like magnetizing current, armature reaction, leakage flux, transient reactance are not introduced; only such quantities are used as actually exist in the machine at one particular load. Thereby the theory of electrical machinery is expressed in terms of the minimum possible number of quantities. No hypothetical currents or fluxes are used and no actual physical quantity is left out. The concept of ``free energy,'' used in thermo dynamics, is introduced and generalized. The criterion of good design of all electrical machines is expressed by a constant, the ``thermodynamic efficiency'' which gives a measure of the effective utilization of iron and space for the transformation of energy. This constant plays a most fundamental role in the steady and transient behavior of the machine. A method is given by which the direction of flow of energy between different parts of any complicated machine can be easily read off the diagrams. The theory of constant-potential and constant-current electromagnets is used as a stepping stone to show that the theory of the polyphase alternator is identical with the theory of the constant-potential polyphase transformer if flux linkages and magnetomotive forces are interchanged. The circle diagrams of the transformer and the alternator are developed as well as the elliptical locus diagram of the alternator with salient poles. Problems in the sudden short circuit and the sudden load variation of the polyphase alternator are also solved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1930","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1930","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5055554/","volume":"49","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1930","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Theory of Electrical Machinery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Theory of Electrical Machinery","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v49-n2-45.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022889S","chronDate":"April  1930","isNumber":"5055509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"23","articleId":"5055554","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1930","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5055558,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Part I was an extension of the fundamental theory; Part II, a treatment of torque-angle characteristics under steady-state conditions; Part III, a study of torque-angle characteristics under transient conditions; and Part IV, an analysis of single-phase short circuits. In the present paper, equations for the currents in the armature phases and field under three-phase short circuit are developed. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first covers the case of short circuit at no-load when the resistance is negligible in determining the magnitude of the current although it must naturally be considered in finding the decrement factors; the second considers the same case where the resistance does affect the magnitude of the current; the third covers the case of short circuit under load when resistance is negligible as in the first case. The effect of the nature of the load, i. e., whether the power factor is lagging or leading, is studied and some interesting results are brought out. It is shown that short circuits under load may give less current than at no-load, and it is further developed that under certain practical operating conditions it is even possible to obtain sub-stantially no fundamental current. The paper is illustrated with comparisons of calculated curves and oscillograms showing the actual currents obtained in test.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5055509","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5055509/05055558.pdf","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1930.5055558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1930.5055558","startPage":"700","endPage":"714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-phase short circuit synchronous machines-V","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1930","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1930","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5055558/","displayDocTitle":"Three-phase short circuit synchronous machines-V","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 1930","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-phase short circuit synchronous machines-V","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v49-n2-49.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036677S","chronDate":"April  1930","isNumber":"5055509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"23","articleId":"5055558","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1930","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5055572,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In other words, for continuously maintained maximum temperatures the hot spot should not exceed 95 deg. cent. It is shown by the use of the thermal laws that without increasing the maximum or hot spot temperature, transformers can be overloaded 1 per cent for each degree centigrade by which the ambient is below 30 deg. cent. (air) for self-cooled transformers, 25 deg. (water) for water-cooled transformers. The results of laboratory aging tests conducted on class A insulations in air and in oil are given.

This fact together with a desire on the part of some to connect important units to the line in this manner, has necessitated a study of the protection problem. Such a study is here described, showing oscillograms taken when steep voltage surges were applied to machine windings, measuring internal voltages to ground which are 200 per cent of the voltage allowed by the terminal lightning arrester. A simple traveling wave analysis of these oscillations is developed, which has successfully explained the peculiarities of over 400 oscillograms taken under various terminal conditions. Practical methods of eliminating th. e oscillations with neutral impedance are outlined in the light of the theory developed, and oscillographic evidence supporting their reliability is given. A generalized theory of neutral protection is proposed. The importance of wave-front, surge impedance of incoming line, arrester resistance, and other factors is discussed. Methods for protection of the turn insulation and the insulation to ground of such machines are suggested, showing that the lightning arrester only limits the potential of waves entering the machine and cannot control oscillations which may take place within the machine. The advantages of thyrite as a neutral resistor are pointed out in connection with the short-circuit protection, telephone interference, and lighting protection problems of such machines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1930","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5055702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1930","volume":"49","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1930","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Voltage oscillations in armature windings under lightning impulses-I","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage oscillations in armature windings under lightning impulses-I","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v49-n4-59.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034715S","chronDate":"Oct.  1930","isNumber":"5055643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"54","articleId":"5055702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1930","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5055756,"authors":[{"name":"C.

These impedances in turn depend largely upon the character of damper windings. The paper discusses the effect of amortisseur or damper windings upon both the real and reactive components of the negative sequence impedance. Machines without damper windings possess the highest negative sequence reactance and from this viewpoint are the most desirable, but machines with high-resistance damper windings possess the highest negative sequence resistance. Calculations show that combining the effect of resistance and reactance, the high-resistance damper is more desirable. In the event of system oscillations low-resistance copper damper windings produce the greatest damping of the mechanical movement. However, this effect is unimportant during and following a system fault except in the exceptional, rather rare case in which the system is so constituted that pull-out takes place as a result of compound oscillations following a disturbance. Consideration is also given to a special type of double deck damper winding.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Shock absorbers","Impedance","Power generation","Stability","Transformers","Machine windings","Torque","Automatic generation control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1931.5055756","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5055728/05055756.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5055728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1931.5055756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damper Windings for Water-Wheel Generators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5055756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Damper Windings for Water-Wheel Generators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5055756/","volume":"50","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1931","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1931","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1931","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damper Windings for Water-Wheel Generators","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v50-n1-28.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020475S","chronDate":"March  1931","isNumber":"5055728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"10","articleId":"5055756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1931","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5055827,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The origin, shape, and general characteristics of traveling waves are discussed. The equivalent circuits of terminal equipment and the corresponding reflections and refractions from such junctions are given for a large number of cases. The methods of computing a multiplicity of successive reflections by means of lattices are described. The effect of line losses in equalizing the subsidence of traveling waves and on their attenuation and distortion is also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1931","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1931","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5055827/","volume":"50","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1931","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Traveling Waves on Transmission Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traveling Waves on Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v50-n2-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045784S","chronDate":"June  1931","isNumber":"5055801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"47","articleId":"5055827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1931","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5055943,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The method of symmetrical components requires sequence reactances, and an accurate theory of transients requires transient and subtransient reactances and time constants. Most of the published discussion on the constants has been concerned with the application, rather than the calculation of values. In this paper, all of the most significant constants are calculated, except the subtransient time constant. A general method of calculation is discussed in which the reactances are accurately resolved into components. Comparisons of test and calculated values are given. The formulas for salient-pole machines and turbine generators are given in Appendixes A and B. The principle of superposition is applied to resolve accurately the reactances into components which can be readily calculated. The induced currents in the field and additional damping circuits are accounted for simply by applying the constant interlinkage theorem.","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1931.5055943","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5055933/05055943.pdf","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1931.5055943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5055933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of Synchronous Machine Constants- Reactances and Time Constants Affecting Transient Characteristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5055943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1931","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1931","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of Synchronous Machine Constants- Reactances and Time Constants Affecting Transient Characteristics","volume":"50","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1931","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of Synchronous Machine Constants- Reactances and Time Constants Affecting Transient Characteristics","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v50-n4-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02782S","chronDate":"Dec.  1931","isNumber":"5055933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"103","articleId":"5055943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1931","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5056090,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The purpose of this paper is to present certain possibilities and limitations of the performance which may be obtained by variation of the damper winding design. For purposes of consideration, damper windings are arbitrarily classified as low reactance and high reactance types. It is pointed out that low reactance damper windings are well suited to give a high ratio of torque to kva., especially during the initial part of the starting period. Many other types of performance, including a fairly uniform torque over the starting period or, a low starting torque with high pull-in torque-all with a relatively low kva. can be obtained with high reactance windings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronous motors","Torque control","Circuits","Stator windings","Machine windings","Magnetic separation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1932.5056090","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5056063/05056090.pdf","startPage":"424","endPage":"430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5056063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1932.5056090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Considerations in the Design of Damper Windings for Synchronous Motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5056090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Some Considerations in the Design of Damper Windings for Synchronous Motors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5056090/","volume":"51","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1932","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1932","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1932","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Considerations in the Design of Damper Windings for Synchronous Motors","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v51-n2-27.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027243S","chronDate":"June  1932","isNumber":"5056063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5056090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1932","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5056160,"authors":[{"name":"F.

It has been found that electric shock may derange heart action causing ventricular fibrillation without damage to heart tissue, but resulting in death within a few minutes. This heart effect establishes the maximum current that may be withstood safely for short durations. Threshold fibrillating currents were determined for different conditions of pathway, frequency, and duration using numerous anesthetized animals of different species, comparable in size with man. The discovery was made that the heart is susceptible for only about 20 per cent of its cycle. Successful recoveries from ventricular fibrillation were obtained with large animals of several species by high intensity shocks of short duration.","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1936.5057302","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5057286/05057302.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1936.5057302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5057286","startPage":"498","endPage":"515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Electric Shock on the Heart","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5057302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Electric Shock on the Heart","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1936","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5057302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1936","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1936","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Electric Shock on the Heart","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v55-n5-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067203S","chronDate":"May  1936","isNumber":"5057286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"81","articleId":"5057302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1936","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5057392,"authors":[{"name":"P.

GENERAL 1. Studies of effects in actual low-frequency inductive exposures have been useful in developing general procedural methods, but have indicated the need of further work on certain items, with reference particularly to facilitating the appraisal of proposed situations in advance of construction. INFLUENCE 2. In the calculation of residual currents, the more important gaps have been filled by the experimental determinations of the impedance of ground-faults on operating systems, and of the impedance and admittances of lines (especially cables). 3. In residual-current limitation, probably the most interesting development is the installation, within the last three years, of about 30 Petersen coils. The Petersen coil generally limits residual currents to small values. Little or on change in the status of other methods of fault-current limitation has taken place. As heretofore, the application of fault-current limitation is primarily a matter of its reaction on power-systems operation, although developments have somewhat simplified this question. 4. Frequency of occurrence of ground faults has been reduced by improvements in the insulation of power lines, including improved ground-wire application and features of structural design. In the reduction of duration of ground faults, the protector tube is probably the most important development from the standpoint of low-frequency induction.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1940.5058153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5058146","startPage":"403","endPage":"412","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5058146/05058153.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-ordination of Power and communication Circuits for Low-Frequency Induction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5058153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1940","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1940","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Co-ordination of Power and communication Circuits for Low-Frequency Induction","publicationDate":"July 1940","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-ordination of Power and communication Circuits for Low-Frequency Induction","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v59-n7-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088827S","chronDate":"July  1940","isNumber":"5058146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"6","articleId":"5058153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1940","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5058202,"authors":[{"name":"M.

From these results, the conception of the phenomena occurring in the machine is very difficult and in addition the formulas obtained are so long that the calculation becomes tedious and errors can easily be made. In this paper, an attempt has been made to find a simple physical explanation for the positive and negative damping torques of the synchronous machine and on this basis to derive simpler formulas for the calculation of the damping torques. It has been found that the torque of the synchronous machine, as a double-fed machine, consists of three components, two dependent on the speed of the machine and the third dependent on the angle between the rotating field and the rotor. When the synchronous machine oscillates, the change of the first two components produces positive and negative damping torques of the synchronous machine. The change of the third component produces the synchronizing torque. The positive damping torque depends mainly on the primary voltage and secondary resistance; the negative damping torque depends mainly on the excitation and the primary resistance. This knowledge. made it possible to derive a simple and very accurate formula for the positive damping torque as well as a simple approximate formula for negative damping torque. On the basis of these formulas, the influence of the two axes of the machine on the damping can be easily found.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Synchronous machines","Torque","Voltage","Equations","Mathematical analysis","Testing","Frequency synchronization","Electric resistance","Machinery"]}],"doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1941.5058316","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5058310/05058316.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5058310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1941.5058316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Positive and Negative Damping in Synchronous Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5058316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Positive and Negative Damping in Synchronous Machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5058316/","volume":"60","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1941","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1941","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1941","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Positive and Negative Damping in Synchronous Machines","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v60-n5-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035445S","chronDate":"May  1941","isNumber":"5058310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"13","articleId":"5058316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1941","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5058341,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The currents ranged from less than 10,000 amperes to values as high as 100,000 amperes rms in some cases. The new data dispel several illusions with respect to accidental faults in low-voltage bus structures and other low-voltage gear. Contrary to inferences frequently drawn from previously published data, the paper shows that (a). Faults in the typical low-voltage bus structures tested are not self-clearing. (b). Fault arcs do not show the drastic current-limiting effect which they are frequently assumed to exert upon short-circuit currents. Instances are shown where actual fault currents reach 100 per cent of the rms symmetrical values calculated for bolted faults. This study shows a self-clearing tendency for representative types of accidental faults in cable, but it was found that a large current-limiting action prior to current interruption cannot be depended on. The new data, supplementing existing impedance data, definitely indicate the possibility of reasonably accurate calculation of short-circuit currents in low-voltage circuits.","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1941.5058364","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5058326/05058364.pdf","startPage":"479","endPage":"487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1941.5058364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5058326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Voltage Drop and Impedance at Short-Circuit Currents in Low-Voltage Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1941","displayDocTitle":"Fault Voltage Drop and Impedance at Short-Circuit Currents in Low-Voltage Circuits","volume":"60","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1941","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5058364/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1941","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Voltage Drop and Impedance at Short-Circuit Currents in Low-Voltage Circuits","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v60-n6-38.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034884S","chronDate":"June  1941","isNumber":"5058326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"23","articleId":"5058364","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1941","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5058374,"authors":[{"name":"C.

With the determination of wave form accomplished, demand arose for its standardization corresponding to expanding applications. No single standard being suited to all applications, different standards have been developed in different fields, as in power, communication, and insulation. While it is desirable that standards, once set up, remain fairly stable, they should be subject to review and occasional change to keep in step with technological Advances. Minor revision in communication is in progress. Although standards in other fields do not appear ideal, no immediate revision is recommended.

This solves the troublesome problem of saturation and provides a linear relationship between secondary voltage and primary current. The coupler secondaries for a given bus are connected in a series loop with the relay. When the currents entering and leaving the bus are equal, the net induced voltage in the relay loop is zero. For a fault on the bus, however, the net induced voltage, proportional to the fault current, operates the relay. The problems are: 1. To utilize effectively the smaller available energy. 2. To build couplers of sufficiently equal mutual reactance and unaffected by stray fields. A toroidal coil solved the latter problem. Through tests have shown that the performance is strictly linear with respect to primary currnet, practically unaffected by the primary d-c transient, and thus can be calculated accurately and simply.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1942","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1942","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5058522/","volume":"61","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1942","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linear Couplers for Bus Protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Couplers for Bus Protection","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v61-n5-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036841S","chronDate":"May  1942","isNumber":"5058519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"18","articleId":"5058522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1942","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5058642,"authors":[{"name":"Charles F.

It is thus evidently not the objective but the means that characterizes the electronic power converter. The emphasis is on electronic means and the term is limited to conversion of power as distinguished from electric energy for purposes of communication. Thus, the name is a definition.

The working formulas used by the writers require only simple arithmetical calculations which can be handled by clerical personnel usually available in the engineering office. The calculations are not laborious, and can be easily checked. The writers' method not only develops the sags, tensions, and conductor lengths for the various final and initial conditions of the design span (basic or ruling span), but also similar data for span lengths other than the ruling span. The procedure outlined is applicable to any cable or wire whose modulus of elasticity and coefficient of expansion are uniform throughout the cross section, such as is the case with copper, copper-coatedsteel, or steel cables. Sag and tension problems for composite cables such as aluminum cables steel reinforced, are usually solved by graphic methods based on stress-strain curves developed from laboratory tests on the particular cable under consideration. The writers' method does, however, develop previously unpublished relationships between sags, tensions, and cable lengths which are applicable not only to copper, copper-coated-steel, and steel cables, but also to problems involving composite cables, which information cannot be secured by graphic methods alone. The text gives the basic catenary formulas, the derivations thereof, and an explanation of the procedure followed in actual sag calculations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5059021/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1945","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1945","publicationDate":"Oct. 1945","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","volume":"64","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sag and tension calculations for cable and wire spans using catenary formulas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sag and tension calculations for cable and wire spans using catenary formulas","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v64-n10-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051286S","chronDate":"Oct.  1945","isNumber":"5059018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5059021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1945","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5059039,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It has been shown that the quantities obtained by the use of earlier distance relay connections for both line and ground faults do not give the closest approach to the desired result, a constant indication for all types of faults at a given location. It has been shown further that, by the use of different connections and certain auxiliary apparatus, a constant relaying indication may be obtained by the line relays for all types of line faults and by the ground relays for all types of faults involving ground, if the fault resistance is zero, and, if the fault resistance is not zero, that smaller deviations from the normal value will be obtained for a given fault resistance. The analysis has been based upon the assumptions of sine wave currents and voltages, constant circuit impedances, and negligible distributed capacitance in the faulted sections of line. It has been assumed further that the fault impedance is resistance only and that it is effectively constant throughout each cycle. All of these assumptions, except perhaps the latter, are reasonably valid as far as relaying is concerned, although some consideration must be given to the d-c component of the short-circuit currents with very high-speed relays.","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1947.5059494","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5059393/05059494.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5059393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1947.5059494","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","startPage":"694","endPage":"709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Basis for Distance Relaying on 3-Phase Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5059494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1947","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1947","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Basis for Distance Relaying on 3-Phase Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5059494/","volume":"66","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1947","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Basis for Distance Relaying on 3-Phase Systems","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v66-n1-101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044617S","chronDate":"Jan.  1947","isNumber":"5059393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"46","articleId":"5059494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1947","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5059525,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This work reviews briefly the principles of pulse communication and its extension to PCM. Unlike the conventional types of modulation, PCM is represented by a discrete scanning of the amplitude of the modulating signal rather than a continuous amplitude scanning, in addition to the discrete scanning in time which is common to the other forms of pulse modulation. The discrete nature of such a system introduces a type of distortion which is a function of the number of amplitude levels used. The relation between the numbers of levels and this type of distortion has been investigated and is discussed. Several types of signals are analyzed mathematically; namely, a single-frequency signal, a 2-frequency signal, and finally a continuous band of frequencies. In connection with the multifrequency case, the application of the Fourier transform to pulse amplitude modulation and its extension to PCM is introduced. In addition, the cross talk introduced in different channels of the modulating frequency is shown graphically for several amplitude levels.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5059393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1947.5059539","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5059393/05059539.pdf","startPage":"989","endPage":"1005","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1947.5059539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortion in a Pulse Count Modulation System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1947","displayDocTitle":"Distortion in a Pulse Count Modulation System","volume":"66","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1947","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5059539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1947","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion in a Pulse Count Modulation System","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v66-n1-146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029094S","chronDate":"Jan.  1947","isNumber":"5059393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"28","articleId":"5059539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1947","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5059579,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Previous authors have used two distinct methods for evaluating the differential reactance, but the results obtained by these two methods have been inconsistent, particularly for open slot machines. The overlap method is based on calculating the average overlap of the teeth on the primary and secondary, and then calculating the leakage through the zig-zag flux path under the combined influence of the primary and secondary ampere turns. The ``differential method'' is that of calculating the leakage by taking the difference between the total flux produced by the primary or the secondary, and the fundamental sine wave of the flux. When the effects of flux fringing with open slots are included, the results obtained by the two methods are shown to be entirely consistent. The new formulas derived in this way are believed to be more general in application than any heretofore published. They show that the slot openings decrease the differential leakage reactance much more rapidly than they decrease the magnetizing reactance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1947","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1947","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5059579/","volume":"66","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1947","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Air Gap Reactance of Polyphase Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Air Gap Reactance of Polyphase Machines","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v66-n1-186.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035594S","chronDate":"Jan.  1947","isNumber":"5059393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5059579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1947","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5059641,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The approximate 7 to 10 rule for the temperature coefficient of deterioration rate is replaced by a more accurate theoretical expression.

On buses with less than 4-inch spacing, it would be expected that the arc would have more of a tendency to stabilize itself. 2. About half of the line-to-line arcing faults on the 500-volt circuit were unstable and extinguished themselves. 3. The magnitudes of the first-half-cycle values of current are dependent upon the means of initiating the fault. In using a relatively small wire for the initiating means, the current as compared to the bolted-fault current decreases as the circuit current level is increased. On the 500-volt circuits, the results of the copper bar and steel bar tests indicate that a factor of 0.9 might be applied to the bolted symmetrical current for systems whose bolted-fault currents are in excess of 40,000 amperes and a factor of 1.0 for systems whose bolted-fault currents are less than 40,000 amperes. On 250-volt circuits, the factor appears to be smaller. 4. On 500-volt circuits, the sustained currents may be less than 0.8 of the bolted symmetrical currents.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault currents","Circuit faults","Circuit testing","Wire","Voltage","Copper","Fuses","Cables","Circuit breakers","Arc discharges"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5059656","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1948.5059656","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5059631/05059656.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1948.5059656","startPage":"166","endPage":"174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5059631","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arcing Fault Currents in Low-Voltage A-C Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Arcing Fault Currents in Low-Voltage A-C Circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5059656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1948","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1948","volume":"67","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 1948","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arcing Fault Currents in Low-Voltage A-C Circuits","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v67-n1-25.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029209S","chronDate":"Jan.  1948","isNumber":"5059631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5059656","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1948","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5059821,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob Rabinow","affiliation":["National Bureau of Standards, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Rabinow","id":"37322254300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-3860"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2330-9431"}],"articleNumber":"5059821","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1045},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5059821","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic liquids","Iron","Saturation magnetization","Electrostatics","Petroleum","Magnetic particles","Torque","Acceleration","Magnetic levitation","Magnetic fields"]}],"doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1948.5059821","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5059758/05059821.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1315","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/05059821.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1948.5059821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5059758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Magnetic Fluid Clutch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5059821/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1948","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1948","displayDocTitle":"The Magnetic Fluid Clutch","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1948","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Magnetic Fluid Clutch","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-v67-n2-63.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025278S","chronDate":"Jan.  1948","isNumber":"5059758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"26","articleId":"5059821","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1948","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5059897,"authors":[{"name":"J.
