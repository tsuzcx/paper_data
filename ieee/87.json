With these ARQ techniques, the number of retransmissions is limited, and, similar to forward error correction (FEC), error-free delivery of data packets cannot be guaranteed. Bounds on the average number of transmissions, the average coding rate as well as the reliability of the schemes are derived using random coding techniques, and the performance is compared with FEC. The random coding bounds reveal the achievable performance with block codes and maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoding. Union upper bounds and simulation results show that over block fading channels, these bounds can be closely approached with simple terminated convolutional codes and soft-decision Viterbi decoding. Truncated type-II hybrid ARQ and the corresponding FEC schemes have the same probability of packet erasure; however, the truncated ARQ schemes offer a trade-off between the average coding rate and the probability of undetected error. Truncated ARQ schemes have significantly higher average coding rates than FEC at high and medium signal-to-noise ratio even with noisy feedback. Truncated ARQ can be viewed as adaptive FEC that adapts to the instantaneous channel conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of truncated type-II hybrid ARQ schemes with noisy feedback over block fading channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.870015","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18847/00870015.pdf","startPage":"1477","endPage":"1487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.870015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=870015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870015/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","displayDocTitle":"Performance of truncated type-II hybrid ARQ schemes with noisy feedback over block fading channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6744927","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of truncated type-II hybrid ARQ schemes with noisy feedback over block fading channels","sourcePdf":"00870015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075453S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"18847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"131","articleId":"870015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":870016,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The demodulator is used in conjunction with a soft-decision channel-optimized vector quantization (COVQ) system. The COVQ is constructed for an expanded (q>1) discrete channel consisting of the concatenation of the modulator, the Gaussian channel, and the demodulator. It is found that as the demodulator resolution q increases, the capacity of the expanded channel increases, resulting in an improvement of the COVQ performance. Consequently, the soft-decision demodulator is designed to maximize the capacity of the expanded channel. Three Gaussian channel models are considered as follows: (1) additive white Gaussian noise channels; (2) additive colored Gaussian noise channels; and (3) Gaussian channels with intersymbol interference. Comparisons are made with (a) hard-decision COVQ systems, (b) COVQ systems which utilize interleaving, and (c) an unquantized (q=/spl infin/) soft-decision decoder proposed by Skoglund and Hedelin (1999). It is shown that substantial improvements can be achieved over COVQ systems which utilize hard decision demodulation and/or channel interleaving. The performance of the proposed COVQ system is comparable with the system by Skoglund and Hedelin-though its computational complexity is substantially less.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6744929","volume":"48","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Soft-decision demodulation design for COVQ over white, colored, and ISI Gaussian channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-decision demodulation design for COVQ over white, colored, and ISI Gaussian channels","sourcePdf":"00870017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03493S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"18847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"30","articleId":"870017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":870018,"authors":[{"name":"B.D.

The practically important topics of linear modulations, time-varying frequency-selective channels, differential phase detection, and fractional sampling are accounted for. The MAPDs are derived under different conditions of optimality and a priori knowledge as follows: when the MAP criterion is applied to the constellation mapper's input bits or output symbols, when all observations or only a fixed number of future observations (i.e. fixed-lag MAPDs) from a transmission are available, when the time-varying channel impulse response is perfectly known, and when only the Gaussian-distributed channel's mean and autocovariance and the noise variance are known. As these quantities are actually unknown, their estimation in the context of MAP detection is also discussed. The MAPDs are characterized through simulation and a novel, unified analysis. Although MAPDs are less suited to hardware implementation than the traditional maximum-likelihood sequence detectors, the MAPDs can accept nonuniform a priori bit or symbol probabilities and provide soft outputs. In this way, the MAPDs are well suited to iterative decoding, and so they will become increasingly integral to high-performance receiver designs.","doi":"10.1109/26.870018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.870018","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18847/00870018.pdf","startPage":"1507","endPage":"1519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Innovations-based MAP detection for time-varying frequency-selective channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","displayDocTitle":"Innovations-based MAP detection for time-varying frequency-selective channels","volume":"48","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6744930","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Innovations-based MAP detection for time-varying frequency-selective channels","sourcePdf":"00870018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034654S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"18847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","articleId":"870018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":870019,"authors":[{"name":"Lie-Liang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK"],"lastName":"Lie-Liang Yang","id":"37279441800"},{"name":"L.

In every subband, the SIC receiver successively detects the interferers' signals and substracts them from the user-of-interest. A comparison is made among SIC, a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver, and matched filter (MF) detection with maximal-ratio combining (MRC). We also consider suboptimal combining using pilot symbol-assisted modulation (PSAM) to make the system more realistic. Analytic bit-error probabilities for SIC, MMSE, and MF in correlated Rayleigh fading channels are derived. The theoretical results for SIC, MMSE, and MF are shown to agree well with simulations. In particular, SIC and MMSE are shown to achieve better performance than MF with MRC; when the number of users is small, SIC provides better performance than does MMSE. Further, the correlation among different subcarriers is studied, and only large subcarrier correlation coefficients result in an obvious worsening of performance. Finally, we derive results for the performance degradation that an SIC scheme experiences in MC CDMA due to phase and timing tracking errors. It is shown that SIC can still retain a performance advantage over MF-MRC, although the advantage of SIC decreases with increasing tracking errors, especially when subcarrier correlation coefficients are small.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18847/00870020.pdf","startPage":"1530","endPage":"1540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.870020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.870020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=870020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successive interference cancellation in multicarrier DS/CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Diversity reception","Signal detection","Fading","Degradation","Timing","Multiple access interference","Interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","matched filters","error statistics","Rayleigh channels","tracking","timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["successive interference cancellation","multicarrier DS/CDMA","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access system","band-limited spreading waveforms","self-interference","SIC receiver","minimum mean-squared error receiver","matched filter detection","maximal-ratio combining","suboptimal combining","pilot symbol-assisted modulation","analytic bit-error probabilities","MMSE","correlated Rayleigh fading channels","performance","large subcarrier correlation coefficients","phase","timing tracking errors","subcarrier correlation coefficients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Successive interference cancellation in multicarrier DS/CDMA","volume":"48","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6744932","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive interference cancellation in multicarrier DS/CDMA","sourcePdf":"00870020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066445S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"43","articleId":"870020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":870021,"authors":[{"name":"L.C.

Its first stage is an asynchronous one-shot decorrelator which in terms of computational complexity only requires inversion of K symmetric K/spl times/K matrices for all K users. In addition, the K inversions can be done in parallel, and the computed results for one user can be reused by all other users as well, resulting in a latency of only one bit, same as its synchronous counterpart. The decorrelated tentative decisions are utilized to estimate and subtract multiple-access interference in the second stage. Another novel feature of the detector is the adaptive manner in which the multiple-access interference estimates are formed, which renders prior estimation of the received signal amplitudes and the use of training sequences unnecessary. Adaptation algorithms considered include steepest descent (as well as its stochastic version), and a recursive least squares-type algorithm that offers a faster transient response and better error performance. Sufficient conditions for the receiver to achieve convergence are derived. The detector is near-far resistant, and is shown to provide substantial steady-state error performance improvement over the conventional and decorrelating detector, particularly in the presence of strong interfering signals.","doi":"10.1109/26.870021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18847/00870021.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.870021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18847","startPage":"1541","endPage":"1549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive multiuser CDMA detector for asynchronous AWGN channels-steady state and transient analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=870021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive multiuser CDMA detector for asynchronous AWGN channels-steady state and transient analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870021/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6744933","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive multiuser CDMA detector for asynchronous AWGN channels-steady state and transient analysis","sourcePdf":"00870021.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048918S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"18847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","articleId":"870021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":870022,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

Each channel between the mobile transmitter and the base-station receiver is unknown and arbitrarily varying with time. The optimum filter achieving separation and multipath compensation is time-variant. The typical approach in many multiuser detectors previously proposed is to assume that the channel is almost static (time invariant) and attempt detection according to this model. Slow variations of the channels are then compensated using adaptive algorithms that force the estimates (of the channels or of the separating filters) to be constantly in search of a convergence point. If the channel coefficients variations in time are fast with respect to the convergence time of the adaptive algorithm, significant degradation may result. In this work, we depart from this traditional approach and we investigate new kernels that more accurately can characterize the time-varying nature of the detection problem. As a first step, we show that the super-exponential framework can still be applied in a time-variant environment. Then, we describe a multiresolution decomposition of the filter components, essentially constraining its variations in time to remain within the solution subspace. The resulting algorithm overcomes some of the drawbacks associated with slow convergence and insufficient tracking capability typical of many blind approaches and several nonblind methods based on the slow fading assumption.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind adaptive detection of DS/CDMA signals on time-varying multipath channels with antenna arrays using high-order statistics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.870026","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18847/00870026.pdf","startPage":"1590","endPage":"1600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.870026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=870026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","displayDocTitle":"Blind adaptive detection of DS/CDMA signals on time-varying multipath channels with antenna arrays using high-order statistics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6744938","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind adaptive detection of DS/CDMA signals on time-varying multipath channels with antenna arrays using high-order statistics","sourcePdf":"00870026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056557S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"18847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","articleId":"870026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":870030,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.H.

Nevertheless, if the used training data are corrupted by large noise, such as outliers, traditional backpropagation learning schemes may not always come up with acceptable performance. Even though various robust learning algorithms have been proposed in the literature, those approaches still suffer from the initialization problem. In those robust learning algorithms, the so-called M-estimator is employed. For the M-estimation type of learning algorithms, the loss function is used to play the role in discriminating against outliers from the majority by degrading the effects of those outliers in learning. However, the loss function used in those algorithms may not correctly discriminate against those outliers. In the paper, the annealing robust backpropagation learning algorithm (ARBP) that adopts the annealing concept into the robust learning algorithms is proposed to deal with the problem of modeling under the existence of outliers. The proposed algorithm has been employed in various examples. Those results all demonstrated the superiority over other robust learning algorithms independent of outliers. In the paper, not only is the annealing concept adopted into the robust learning algorithms but also the annealing schedule k/t was found experimentally to achieve the best performance among other annealing schedules, where k is a constant and t is the epoch number.","doi":"10.1109/72.870040","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1077","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/18849/00870040.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.870040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The annealing robust backpropagation (ARBP) learning algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Annealing","Backpropagation algorithms","Training data","Neural networks","Noise robustness","Feedforward neural networks","Scheduling algorithm","Degradation","Mathematical model","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","function approximation","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["annealing robust backpropagation learning algorithm","multilayer feedforward neural networks","initialization problem","outliers","annealing schedule"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","displayDocTitle":"The annealing robust backpropagation (ARBP) learning algorithm","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6720082","pubMedId":"18249835","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The annealing robust backpropagation (ARBP) learning algorithm","sourcePdf":"00870040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050647S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"124","articleId":"870040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":870041,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Liang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control Engineering, Feng Chia University FCU, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Liang Lin","id":"37087161161"},{"name":"Chi-Chih Lai","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control Engineering, Feng Chia University FCU, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Chih Lai","id":"37087222138"},{"name":"Teng-Hsien Huang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control Engineering, Feng Chia University FCU, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Teng-Hsien Huang","id":"37087220406"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"870041","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=870041","abstract":"Gradient-type Hopfield networks have been widely used in optimization problems solving.

We show that weight adaptation plays the roles of noise removal and feature preservation. In particular, our weight adaptation scheme is insensitive to termination time and the resulting dynamic weights in a wide range of iterations lead to the same segmentation results. A computer algorithm derived from oscillatory dynamics is applied to synthetic and real images, and simulation results show that the algorithm yields favorable segmentation results in comparison with other recent algorithms. In addition, the weight adaptation scheme can be directly transformed to a novel feature-preserving smoothing procedure.

We propose the use of a spatial temporal predictor to reconstruct the chaotic dynamic of sea clutter because electromagnetic wave scattering is a spatial temporal phenomenon which is physically modeled by partial differential equations. The spatial temporal predictor used here is called radial basis function coupled map lattice (RBF-CML) which uses linear combination to fuse either measurements in different spatial domains for an RBF prediction or predictions from several RBF nets operated on different spatial regions. Using real-life radar data, it is shown that the RBF-CML is an effective method to reconstruct the sea clutter dynamic. The RBF-CML predictor is then applied to detect small targets in sea clutter using the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) principle. The spatial temporal approach is shown, both theoretically and experimentally, to be superior to a conventional CFAR detector.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870045/","volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6720087","pubMedId":"18249840","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Signal detection using the radial basis function coupled map lattice","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal detection using the radial basis function coupled map lattice","sourcePdf":"00870045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032047S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"36","articleId":"870045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":870047,"authors":[{"name":"James Tin-Yau Kwok","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"James Tin-Yau Kwok","id":"37087648773"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"870047","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":113,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Bayesian methods","Kernel","Upper bound","Risk management","Machine learning","Learning systems","Pattern recognition","Training data","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","inference mechanisms","pattern classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","Bayes methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector machine","Bayesian inference","MacKay evidence framework","feedforward neural networks","pattern classification","learning"]}],"abstract":"We show that training of the support vector machine (SVM) can be interpreted as performing the level 1 inference of MacKay's evidence framework (1992).

A new tuning scheme is proposed which can guarantee the boundedness of tracking error and weight updates. A main advantage of our method is that it does not require regression matrices, so that no preliminary dynamical analysis is needed. Another salient feature of our NN approach is that the off-line learning phase is not needed. Full state feedback is needed for implementation.

High aspect-ratio polysilicon structures are created by refilling hundreds of micrometers deep trenches with polysilicon deposited over a sacrificial oxide layer. Thick single-crystal silicon structures are released from the substrate through the front side of the wafer by means of a combined directional and isotropic silicon dry etch and are protected on the sides by refilled trenches. This process is capable of producing electrically isolated polysilicon and silicon electrodes as tall as the main body structure with various size capacitive air gaps ranging from submicrometer to tens of micrometers. Using bent-beam strain sensors, residual stress in 80-/spl mu/m-thick 4-/spl mu/m-wide trench-refilled vertical polysilicon beams fabricated in this technology has been measured to be virtually zero. 300-/spl mu/m-long 80-/spl mu/m-thick polysilicon clamped-clamped beam micromechanical resonators have shown quality factors as high as 85 000 in vacuum. The all-silicon feature of this technology improves long-term stability and temperature sensitivity, while fabrication of large-area vertical pickoff electrodes with submicrometer gap spacing will increase the sensitivity of micro-electromechanical devices by orders of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/84.870053","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/18850/00870053.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.870053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High aspect-ratio combined poly and single-crystal silicon (HARPSS) MEMS technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=870053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870053/","displayDocTitle":"High aspect-ratio combined poly and single-crystal silicon (HARPSS) MEMS technology","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6726363","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High aspect-ratio combined poly and single-crystal silicon (HARPSS) MEMS technology","sourcePdf":"00870053.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102382S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"126","articleId":"870053","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":870058,"authors":[{"name":"E.K.

The actuator employs a series capacitor to extend the effective electrical gap of the device and to provide stabilizing negative feedback. Sources of parasitics-from layout and two-dimensional nonuniform deformation-that limit the actuation range are identified and their effects quantified. Two \"folded capacitor\" designs that minimize the parasitics and are straightforward to implement in multiuser microelectromechanical processes are introduced. The effects of residual charge are analyzed, and a linear electrostatic actuator exploiting those effects is proposed. Extended travel is achieved in fabricated devices, but is ultimately limited by tilting instabilities. Nevertheless, the resultant designs are smaller than devices based on other extended-travel technologies, making them attractive for applications that require high fill factors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870058/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","volume":"9","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6726368","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Electrostatic micromechanical actuator with extended range of travel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrostatic micromechanical actuator with extended range of travel","sourcePdf":"00870058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044215S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"141","articleId":"870058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":870061,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Wang","affiliation":["Delphi Research and Development, Delphi Automotive Systems Corporation, Warren, MI, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Kun Wang","id":"37365209200"},{"name":"Ark-Chew Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Ark-Chew Wong","id":"37361051000"},{"name":"C.T.-C.

This configuration is often used in micromechanical chemical sensors. The model is based an a closed-form solution of a resonating beam; however, the results are applicable to plates supported on four edges. The model gives a voltage or charge output from the sense combs as a function of voltage applied to the drive combs. The analysis predicts the response of the multiple plate modes to axial tensions and to comb finger dimensions and position relative to the diaphragm eigenfunctions. These models are much more detailed than those described in the literature on acoustic chemical sensors and are difficult to obtain by finite-element solutions. Frequency responses of FPW devices constructed from silicon with deposited aluminum nitride as the piezoelectric compared well with analytic results.

Indeed the symbol-level equalizer performs better than the chip-level, but is computationally more demanding. The symbol-level equalizer is optimal for \"saturated cells\" where all Walsh-Hadamard channel codes are in use and have equal power. It performs very close to optimal even for relatively lightly loaded cells. We derive a bound on the off-diagonals of the covariance matrix of the transmitted data that helps explain why the equalizer works when there are fewer active channel codes than the spreading factor. Performance is evaluated through simulations to obtain the average bit error rate (BER) over a class of channels for two cases: no out-of-cell interference, and one equal power base-station. The symbol- and chip-level equalizers are compared to the conventional RAKE receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing (Cat.

When the communication channel introduces intersymbol interference (ISI) at the receiver end, demodulation of such signals can be performed by constant modulus algorithm (CMA) based equalizers to cancel the interference. However, characteristics of modulated signals are only partially considered in the CMA cost function. In this paper, more constraints are imposed on the equalized signal to fully capture the property of the modulated signal both in its phase and amplitude. Observing that PAM signals are uniformly spaced on the x-axis and QAM signals in two-dimensional signal space, the property of transmitted signals from each category can be included in an equivalent deterministic mathematical description, similar to the constant modulus. This description is absorbed in our modified cost function, resulting in a simultaneous minimization of dispersion relevant to signal phase and amplitude. The performance of the equalizers based on these new algorithms are compared with the CMA equalizer.","doi":"10.1109/SSAP.2000.870076","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing (Cat.

In many applications, such as separation of speech or fading communications signals, the sources are nonstationary. Furthermore, the source signals may undergo convolutive (or dynamic) linear mixing, and a more complex BSS algorithm is required to achieve better source separation. We present a new BSS algorithm for separating linear convolutive mixtures of nonstationary signals which relies on the nonstationary nature of the sources to achieve separation. The algorithm is an on-line, LMS-like update based on minimizing the average squared cross-output-channel-correlations along with unity average energy output in each channel. We explain why, for nonstationary signals, such a criterion is sufficient to achieve source separation regardless of the signal statistics.","doi":"10.1109/SSAP.2000.870080","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing (Cat.

Since the covariance matrix derived from such virtual arrays is usually very underspecified, we discuss a maximum-likelihood (ML) completion philosophy to fill in the missing elements of the partially specified Hermitian covariance matrix. Next, a transformation of the resulting unstructured ML matrix results in a sequence of properly structured positive-definite Hermitian matrices, each with their (M/sub /spl alpha//-/spl mu/) smallest eigenvalues being equal, appropriate for the candidate number of sources /spl mu/. For each candidate model (/spl mu/=1 to M/sub /spl alpha//-1), we then find the set of directions-of-arrival (DOAs) and powers that yield the minimum fitting error for the specified covariance lags in the neighbourhood of the MUSIC-initialised DOAs. Finally, these models describe a hypothesis with respect to the actual number of sources, and allow us to select the \"best\" hypothesis using traditional information criteria (AIC, MDL, MAP, etc.) that are based on the likelihood ratio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","conferenceDate":"16-16 Aug. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6748561","displayDocTitle":"Detection-estimation of more uncorrelated sources than sensors in noninteger sparse linear antenna arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection-estimation of more uncorrelated sources than sensors in noninteger sparse linear antenna arrays","confLoc":"Pocono Manor, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00870090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091759S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6991","citationCount":"2","articleId":"870090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":870099,"authors":[{"name":"M.

When the noise is non-white (colored or correlated) but has a known covariance matrix, we can still handle the problem through prewhitening. However, there are no techniques presently available to deal with completely unknown noise fields. It is well known that when the noise covariance matrix is unknown, the channel parameters may be grossly inaccurate. In this paper, we assume the noise is spatially correlated, and we apply this assumption for blind channel identification. We estimate the noise covariance matrix without any assumption except its structure which is assumed to be a band-Toeplitz matrix.

One promising theoretical measure, known as the spread, provides a means for quantifying potential correlation between signal elements. In previous papers we investigated the issue of implementing such a measure for discrete signals. The numerical spread was introduced as a means of applying and investigating the techniques previously only studied theoretically. When implementing such a scheme it became necessary to augment the covariance matrix so that the resulting ambiguity space has a uniform resolution. In this paper we compare three extension schemes: zero padding, circular extension, and edge replication, to determine which provides the best estimate of the numerical spread. Based on our results, we determined that the method of normalized edge replication is least likely to inflate the estimate of the spread.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSAP.2000.870122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18842","startPage":"252","endPage":"256","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing (Cat.

Unlike existing maximum likelihood BSS techniques, the proposed algorithm is consistent for any source distribution, provided that the usual identifiability condition (at most one Gaussian source) is satisfied. Closed-form expressions are derived for the true Cramer Rao bound (CRB), for the CRB corresponding to the Edgeworth approximation, and for the large-sample variance of the proposed estimator.

This extension of the Chen-Donoho algorithm, which we call the l/sup 1/-FFT, incorporates the a priori information that the spectrum is sparse by minimizing the l/sup 1/ norm of the coefficients of the expansion functions. The l/sup 1/-FFT is applied to stepped-frequency ISAR imaging where it increases resolution by factors of 4 and 64 over that of the windowed Fourier transform, for the real and simulated data presented here. In the second application, to determine the effects of aging on the crystal structure of plutonium, the l/sup 1/-FFT is used to transform EXAFS plutonium data. The l/sup 1/-FFT increases inter-atomic spatial resolution by a factor of 64 over that delivered by a windowed Fourier transform.","doi":"10.1109/SSAP.2000.870166","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing (Cat.

It is demonstrated that the multistage nested Wiener filter (MSNWF) outperforms other reduced-rank techniques in terms of suppressing both wideband and narrowband jammers under conditions of low sample support.","doi":"10.1109/SSAP.2000.870178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSAP.2000.870178","startPage":"514","endPage":"518","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing (Cat.

It is shown that the bias and variance of the IF estimate are functions of the lag window length. If there is a bias-variance trade-off, then the optimal window length for this tradeoff depends on the unknown IF law. Hence an adaptive algorithm with a time-varying and data-driven window length is needed. The adaptive algorithm can utilize any quadratic time-frequency distribution that satisfies certain conditions. A quadratic distribution that is most suitable for this approach is proposed. The algorithm estimates multiple IF laws by using a tracking algorithm for the signal components and utilizing the property that the proposed distribution enables non-parametric component amplitudes estimation. An extension of the proposed TFD consisting in the use of time-only kernels for adaptive IF estimation is also proposed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Kernel","Time frequency analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Adaptive algorithm","Signal resolution","Amplitude estimation","Adaptive signal processing","Additive noise","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","amplitude estimation","frequency estimation","adaptive estimation","frequency modulation","time-frequency analysis","adaptive signal processing","nonparametric statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-component IF estimation","instantaneous frequency estimation","nonstationary mono-component FM signals","nonstationary multi-component FM signals","additive Gaussian noise","IF estimate bias","IF estimate variance","lag window length","time-varying window length","data-driven window length","quadratic time-frequency distribution","tracking algorithm","nonparametric component amplitudes estimation","time-only kernels","adaptive IF estimation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSAP.2000.870187","startPage":"559","endPage":"563","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing (Cat.

First, we introduce a measure for comparing the resolution performance of TFDs in separating closely spaced components in the time-frequency domain. The measure takes into account key attributes of TFDs such as main-lobes, side-lobes, and cross-terms. The introduction of this measure is an improvement of current techniques which rely on visual inspection of plots. The second result consists in proposing a methodology for designing high resolution quadratic TFDs for the time-frequency analysis of multicomponent signals when components are close to each other. A recently introduced TFD, the B-distribution, and its modified version are defined using this methodology. Finally, the performance comparison of quadratic TFDs using the proposed resolution measure shows that the B-distribution outperforms existing quadratic TFDs in resolving closely spaced components in the time-frequency domain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870192/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6748643","conferenceDate":"16-16 Aug. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A resolution performance measure for quadratic time-frequency distributions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A resolution performance measure for quadratic time-frequency distributions","confLoc":"Pocono Manor, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00870192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026813S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6991","citationCount":"10","articleId":"870192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":870199,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Jing Liang","id":"37337013300"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhi Ding","id":"37278651400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5988-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"870199","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Multiuser channels","MIMO","Matrix decomposition","Closed-form solution","Cities and towns","Higher order statistics","Robustness","Multiaccess communication","Source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","multiuser channels","higher order statistics","MIMO systems","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cumulant subspace approach","FIR multiuser channel estimation","blind identification","higher-order statistics","HOS","sufficiency condition","second order subspace approach","closed-form solutions","channel order over-estimation","multiple-input multiple-output models","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"Blind identification of FIR multiuser channels using higher-order statistics (HOS) is investigated in this work.

Particularly, this paper estimates the propagation delays focusing on asynchronous DS-CDMA systems. The proposed minimum conditioned variance (MCV) is the choice in noisy environments, implementing the best linear detector of the transmitted symbols under a minimum mean-square error criterion. The result is an estimator that improves the conditional ML (CML) solution when noise is not negligible, and attains the derived Gaussian unconditional Cramer-Rao bound (UCRB) in the whole EbNo range as classical Gaussian unconditional ML (UML) does. Consequently, the proposed MCV estimator, becomes an optimal quadratic solution achieving similar features than UML in a straightforward way, and with no assumptions on the signal statistics.","doi":"10.1109/SSAP.2000.870214","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing (Cat.

The synthetic collimator employs a multiple-pinhole aperture and a high-resolution detector. The problem of multiplexing, normally associated with multiple pinholes, is reduced by obtaining projections at a number of pinhole-detector distances. Projections with little multiplexing are collected at small pinhole-detector distances and high-resolution projections are collected at greater pinhole-detector distances. These projections are then reconstructed using the ML-EM algorithm. It is demonstrated through computer simulations that the synthetic collimator has superior resolution properties to a high-resolution parallel-beam (HRPB) collimator and a specially built ultra-high-resolution parallel-beam (UHRPB) collimator designed for the authors' 0.38-mm pixel CdZnTe detectors. It is also shown that reconstructing images in three dimensions is superior to reconstructing them in two dimensions. The advantages of a high-resolution synthetic collimator over the parallel-hole collimators are apparently reduced in the presence of statistical noise. However, a high-sensitivity synthetic collimator was designed which again shows superior properties to the parallel-hole collimators. Finally, it is demonstrated that, for the cases studied, high-resolution detectors are necessary for the proper functionality of the synthetic collimator.","doi":"10.1109/42.870252","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"412","endPage":"422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/18855/00870252.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.870252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of two- and three-dimensional images from synthetic-collimator data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Detectors","Single photon emission computed tomography","Optical collimators","Face detection","Focusing","Computer simulation","Noise reduction","High-resolution imaging","Cancer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single photon emission computed tomography","image reconstruction","medical image processing","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional images","two-dimensional images","synthetic-collimator data","multiple-pinhole aperture","high-resolution detector","SPECT collimation method","high-resolution projections","nuclear medicine","medical diagnostic imaging","statistical noise","0.38 mm","CdZnTe"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Models, Theoretical","Normal Distribution","Phantoms, Imaging","Poisson Distribution","Scattering, Radiation","Sensitivity and Specificity","Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon","Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2000","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of two- and three-dimensional images from synthetic-collimator data","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6729741","pubMedId":"11021685","publicationDate":"May 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870252/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of two- and three-dimensional images from synthetic-collimator data","sourcePdf":"00870252.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065477S","chronDate":"May  2000","isNumber":"18855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"47","articleId":"870252","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":870255,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

A current trend in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) is to employ transmission scanning to reconstruct the attenuation map. Such an approach, however, considerably complicates both the scanner design and the data acquisition protocol. A dramatic simplification could be made if the attenuation map could be obtained directly from the emission projections, without the use of a transmission scan. This can be done by applying the consistency conditions that enable one to identify the operator of the problem and, thus, to reconstruct the attenuation map. Here, the authors propose a new approach based on the discrete consistency conditions. One of the main advantages of the suggested method over previously used continuous conditions is that it can easily be applied in various scanning configurations, including fully three-dimensional (3-D) data acquisition protocols. Also, it provides a stable numerical implementation, allowing one to avoid the crosstalk between the attenuation map and the source function. A computationally efficient algorithm is implemented by using the QR and Cholesky decompositions. Application of the algorithm to computer-generated and experimentally measured SPECT data is considered.","doi":"10.1109/42.870255","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"451","endPage":"462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/18855/00870255.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.870255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of attenuation map using discrete consistency conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attenuation","Image reconstruction","Positron emission tomography","Computed tomography","Data acquisition","Protocols","Crosstalk","Single photon emission computed tomography","Equations","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","single photon emission computed tomography","positron emission tomography","medical image processing","gamma-ray absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attenuation map reconstruction","nuclear medicine","SPECT","PET","medical diagnostic imaging","scanning configuration","source function","Cholesky decomposition","discrete consistency conditions"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Heart","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Lung","Models, Theoretical","Phantoms, Imaging","Thorax","Time Factors","Tomography, Emission-Computed","Tomography, Emission-Computed","Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon","Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2000","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of attenuation map using discrete consistency conditions","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6729744","pubMedId":"11021688","publicationDate":"May 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870255/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of attenuation map using discrete consistency conditions","sourcePdf":"00870255.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029962S","chronDate":"May  2000","isNumber":"18855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"62","articleId":"870255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":870263,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

The prospective device consists of small arrays of scintillation crystals for which depth of interaction is estimated. Except in very rare instances, the number of annihilation events detected is expected to be far less than the number of distinguishable events. If one were to histogram the acquired data, most histogram bins would remain vacant. Therefore, it seems natural to investigate the efficacy of processing events one at a time rather than processing the data in histogram format. From a reconstruction perspective, the new tomograph presents a challenge in that the rectangular geometry leads to irregular radial and angular sampling, and the field of view extends completely to the detector faces. Simulations are presented that indicate that the proposed tomograph can detect 8-mm-diameter spherical tumors with a tumor-to-background tracer density ratio of 3:1 using realistic image acquisition parameters. Spherical tumors of 4-mm diameter are near the limit of detectability with the image acquisition parameters used. Expressions are presented to estimate the loss of image contrast due to Compton scattering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 2000","accessionNumber":"6729752","pubMedId":"11021696","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"List-mode maximum-likelihood reconstruction applied to positron emission mammography (PEM) with irregular sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"List-mode maximum-likelihood reconstruction applied to positron emission mammography (PEM) with irregular sampling","sourcePdf":"00870263.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032195S","chronDate":"May  2000","isNumber":"18855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"132","articleId":"870263","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":870265,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

The projector should model the imaging geometry and physics as accurately as possible. Some researchers have used backprojectors that are computationally less expensive than the projectors to reduce computation time.

Unlike previous works which concentrate on using a single type of neural network to model friction function, three types of neural network, namely a multilayer perceptron, a radial-basis function network and a modular network, are used in the modelling task. The genetic algorithm is then used to find the optimal combination between the radial-basis function network and the multilayer perceptron and that between the radial-basis function network and the modular network. The simulation results indicate that the genetic algorithm has successfully found the combinations of the neural networks which results in a better compensation performance than using only one type of neural network. As a result of using both neural networks and a genetic algorithm in this application, an idea of a task hybridisation between neural networks and a genetic algorithm for use in a control system is also effectively demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870271","startPage":"22","endPage":"29 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

The design uses an evolutionary algorithm optimisation approach to a multiple model description of the airframe aerodynamics. A set of convex models is produced that map the vertex points in a high order parameter space (of the order of 16 variables). These are used to determine the membership function distribution within the outer loop control system by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. This produces a design that meets objectives related to closed loop performance such as: steady state error, overshoot, settling and rising time. The evolutionary algorithm uses non-dominated sorting for forming a Pareto front of possible solutions. This paper shows that fuzzy controllers can be produced for engineering problems, with the multiobjective algorithm allowing the designer the freedom to choose solutions and investigate the properties of the system.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870275","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

This paper proposes a novel representation technique and suitable variation operators for the degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem. For a weighted, undirected graph G(V, E), this problem seeks to identify the shortest spanning tree whose node degrees do not exceed an upper bound d/spl ges/2. Within the EA, a candidate spanning tree is simply represented by its set of edges. Special initialization, crossover, and mutation operators are used to generate new, always feasible candidate solutions. In contrast to previous spanning tree representations, the proposed approach provides substantially higher locality and is nevertheless computationally efficient; an offspring is always created in O(|V|) time. In addition, it is shown how problem-dependent heuristics can be effectively incorporated into the initialization, crossover, and mutation operators without increasing the time-complexity. Empirical results are presented for hard problem instances with up to 500 vertices. Usually, the new approach identifies solutions superior to those of several other optimization methods within few seconds. The basic ideas of this EA are also applicable to other network optimization tasks.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation. CEC00 (Cat.

In the first stage, which is performed off-line, the proposed EC algorithm is employed to evolve a pool of ANN structures until they converge to an optimum structure. The population is divided into different groups according to their fitness. The elitist group will not undergo any operation, while the second group, i.e. stronger group, undergoes the EP operation. Hence, the behavioral link between the parent and their offspring can be maintained. The weaker group undergoes a GA operation since their behaviors need to be changed more effectively in order to produce better offspring. In the second stage, the evolved ANN obtained from the first stage, which represent the optimum ANN structural design, is used to design the on-line intelligent parameter estimator to estimate the inertia matrix of the robot arm for the AFC controller. In this on-line stage, the ANN parameters, i.e. the weights and biases, are further trained using live data and back-propagation until a satisfactory result is obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through a simulation study performed on a two link planar manipulator operating in a horizontal plane. An external load is introduced to the manipulator to study the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870284/","accessionNumber":"6734612","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid intelligent active force controller for robot arms using evolutionary neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid intelligent active force controller for robot arms using evolutionary neural networks","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00870284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114592S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6997","citationCount":"8","articleId":"870284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":870289,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

During the learning phase of backpropagation, the network weights are adjusted intentionally in order to have an improvement in system performance. By looking at the system outputs of the nodes, it is possible to adjust some of the network weights deterministically so as to achieve an overall reduction in system error. The idea is to work backward from the error components and the system outputs to deduce a deterministic perturbation on particular network weights for optimization purposes. Using the new algorithm, it is found that the weight evolution between the hidden and output layer can accelerate the convergence speed, whereas the weight evolution between the input layer and the hidden layer can assist in solving the local minima problem.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870289","startPage":"153","endPage":"157 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

It consists of deciding the number, type, and location of the active network elements (nodes) and links. This choice is dictated by physical and technological constraints and must optimize several objectives. Example of objectives are monetary cost, network delay, and hop count between communicating pairs. Furthermore, due to the nondeterministic nature of network traffic and other design parameters, the objective criteria are imprecise. Fuzzy logic provides a suitable mathematical framework in such a situation. We present an approach based on the simulated evolution algorithm for the design of campus network topology. The two main phases of the algorithm, namely, evaluation and allocation, have been fuzzified. To diversify the search, we have also incorporated tabu search-based characteristics in the allocation phase of the SE algorithm. This approach is then compared with the simulated annealing algorithm, which is another well-known heuristic. Results show that on all test cases the simulated evolution algorithm exhibits more intelligent search of the solution subspace and was able to find better solutions than simulated annealing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 July 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6734621","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy simulated evolution algorithm for topology design of campus networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy simulated evolution algorithm for topology design of campus networks","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00870293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042468S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6997","citationCount":"3","articleId":"870293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":870294,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

The new algorithm, called MDQL, considers a family of agents for each objective function involved in a MOOP. Each agent proposes a solution for its corresponding objective function. Agents leave traces while they construct solutions considering traces made by other agents. The solutions proposed by the agents are evaluated using a non-domination criterion and solutions in the final Pareto set for each iteration are rewarded. A mechanism for the application of MDQL in continuous spaces which considers a fixed set of possible actions for the states (the number of actions depends on the dimensionality of the MOOP), is also proposed. Each action represents a path direction and its magnitude is changed dynamically depending on the evaluation of the state that the agent reached. Constraint handling, based on reinforcement comparison, considers reference values for constraints, penalizing agents violating any of them proportionally to the violation committed. MDQL performance was measured with \"error ratio\" and \"spacing\" metrics on four test bed problems suggested in the literature, showing competitive results with state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870294","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

In doing so, the need to maximise various production objectives within a highly constrained environment can present an extremely difficult problem. This paper demonstrates the difficulties of attempting to schedule the combination of discrete tasks of varying cycle times with continuous elements. Two implementations of a heuristic genetic algorithm (GA) approach are demonstrated on a processing problem that has similar characteristics to a sugar mill. The implementations include problem-specific representations, single and multiobjective approaches to handle the four problem costs, and various uses of penalty functions to avoid constraint violations. In addition, highly tailored problem-specific operators allow the GA to match its behaviour to the critical elements in the problem definition, specifically those relating to a highly constrained shared storage facility. The results and implications of using such techniques for this type of problem are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2000.870309","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

We address the first problem in this paper, which has been formulated as a multiobjective constrained combinatorial optimisation problem. We propose a genetic algorithm (GA) that aims to approximate the Pareto frontier of the problem. Advanced techniques have been used, such as Pareto ranking, sharing and elitism. The GA has been implemented in parallel on a network of workstations to speed up the search. To evaluate the performance of the GA, we have introduced two new quantitative indicators: the entropy and the contribution. Encouraging results are obtained on real-life problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870312/","accessionNumber":"6734640","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A multiobjective genetic algorithm for radio network optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiobjective genetic algorithm for radio network optimization","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00870312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053985S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6997","citationCount":"51","articleId":"870312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":870313,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

In each sub-population, a simple GA for multi-objective problems is performed. After some generations, all the individuals are gathered and they are sorted again. In this model, the Pareto-optimal solutions which are close to each other are collected into one sub-population.

In particular, genetic algorithms (GAs) provide a more and more attractive solution of many complex engineering problems for which classical optimization methods cannot be used. Besides the ability to learn on their own and become experts in different areas, GAs prove to be parallelizable in a natural way, thus shortening the time to obtain the results. Additionally, parallelization produces higher-quality solutions, as the approach used by parallel genetic algorithms is closer to the evolution of species in nature than the sequential approach. This paper describes the use of parallelism for genetic algorithm development and discusses two aspects of their design: efficiency and the quality of results. Several approaches are presented and comparatively analyzed. The main comparison criteria considered are: performance, flexibility, design structure, communication facilities, ease of design and programming. The analysis highlights the advantages of coarse-grain parallel genetic algorithms, which are more \"adapted\" to the actual architectures of high-performance computers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870328/","accessionNumber":"6734656","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and intrinsic parallel characteristics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and intrinsic parallel characteristics","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00870328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045377S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6997","citationCount":"7","articleId":"870328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":870338,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The GA is guided through the solution space by a set of heuristics/rules which are executed during the evaluation of prospective solutions. The GA commences by identifying multi-terminal net circuit segments (including side nets) for over-the-cell routing, and places these on tracks over-the-cell according to horizontal constraints. The algorithm proceeds to route the remaining net circuits inside the main channel area subject to horizontal and vertical constraints. The over-the-cell routing procedure within the GA ensures that only two terminal nets are left in the main channel after its action. This reduces the amount of congestion in the main channel area. The algorithm is tested on several internationally well-known benchmark examples, and is found to produce significantly better routing solutions than previous approaches to the problem to date.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870350","pdfPath":"/iel5/6997/18852/00870350.pdf","startPage":"586","endPage":"592 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

A distinct feature of the algorithm is its ability to directly evolve and evaluate circuits in a hardware description language (HDL), within a novel environment termed the Virtual Chip. Because the Virtual Chip evolves circuit structures within a HDL, detailed simulation and analysis of each circuit is possible with any technology-specific component library. This feature allows accurate analysis of performance issues such as timing and area. The paper describes the genetic algorithm and the hardware evaluation environment, and provides results with a number of benchmark arithmetic circuits evolved under different performance-driven timing and area constraints. Our results reveal that the genetic algorithm is able to exploit the flexibility provided by a novel chromosome architecture, and utilise a combination of primitive gates and macro components from a component library in order to produce circuits which operate well within timing restrictions. The validity of our results are further supported by comparing the performance of functionally equivalent circuits generated using standard high-level design methodologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870353/","accessionNumber":"6734680","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel genetic algorithm for the automated design of performance driven digital circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel genetic algorithm for the automated design of performance driven digital circuits","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00870353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050355S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6997","citationCount":"7","articleId":"870353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":870360,"authors":[{"name":"Min Woong Hwang","affiliation":["SK Telecom, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Min Woong Hwang","id":"37087843053"},{"name":"Mun Hyuk Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Mun Hyuk Kim","id":"37088132347"},{"name":"Jin Young Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin Young Choi","id":"37087170703"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-6375-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"870360","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=870360","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multilayer perceptrons","Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Prototypes","Backpropagation","Telecommunications","Radial basis function networks","Encoding","Spirals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","radial basis function networks","backpropagation","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second-order multilayer perceptrons","optimization","genetic algorithms","radial basis function networks","circular backpropagation networks","Baldwin effect-based genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870360","pdfPath":"/iel5/6997/18852/00870360.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

Although several studies on NE systems have been made so far, there are no studies that take account of epistasis among weight parameters in training neural networks with GAs. In function optimization, epistasis among parameters is one of the important features which make functions difficult to be optimized. Epistasis among parameters has to be considered in order to successfully optimize difficult functions with large number of parameters to be determined. In this paper, we present an NE system based on a real-coded GA using the Unimodal Normal Distribution Crossover (UNDX). The UNDX shows excellent performance in optimizing functions with strong epistasis among parameters. The NE system based on the UNDX are applied to some benchmark problems, which are more difficult than those used in previous work. The results suggest that epistasis among weight parameters should be considered when we train neural networks for difficult tasks by NE systems.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870361","startPage":"659","endPage":"666 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

In traditional methods, experience and control knowledge of human experts are needed to design fuzzy controllers. However, it takes much time and cost. In this paper, an automatic design method for fuzzy controllers using genetic algorithms, which considers their characteristics is proposed. Our method consists of two stages: rough designing stage and fine tuning stage. In rough designing stage, we determine the number and rough center positions of membership functions, and rule table. In fine tuning stage, exact positions of each membership function are obtained and the rule table is refined. Also, we proposed an effective encoding scheme and new genetic operators. The proposed genetic operators maintain the characteristics, such as the correspondence between membership functions and control rules. The proposed method is applied to a cart centering problem.

The modern Web architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. We introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support.","doi":"10.1145/337180.337228","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 International Conference on Software Engineering.

In this implementation, the entire Brillouin zone is discretized using a nonuniform mesh in k-space, and a transition table is generated between all initial and final states on the mesh, greatly simplifying the final state selection of the conventional Monte Carlo algorithm. This method allows for fully anisotropic scattering rates within the fullband scheme, at the cost of increased memory requirements for the transition table itself. Good agreement is obtained between the CA model and previously reported results for the velocity-field characteristics and high field distribution function, which illustrate the potential accuracy of the technique. A hybrid CA/Monte Carlo algorithm is introduced which helps alleviate the memory problems of the CA method while preserving the speed up and accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","silicon","semiconductors","Monte Carlo methods","cellular automata","electronic engineering computing","transport processes","Brillouin zones","scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid fullband CA/Monte Carlo approach","fast simulation","charge transport","semiconductors","fullband cellular automaton code","electron transport","hole transport","Si","GaAs","Brillouin zone discretization","nonuniform mesh","transition table generation","state selection","Monte Carlo algorithm","fully anisotropic scattering rates"]}],"doi":"10.1109/16.870571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/18851/00870571.pdf","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.870571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid fullband cellular automaton/Monte Carlo approach for fast simulation of charge transport in semiconductors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=870571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid fullband cellular automaton/Monte Carlo approach for fast simulation of charge transport in semiconductors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870571/","volume":"47","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6731035","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid fullband cellular automaton/Monte Carlo approach for fast simulation of charge transport in semiconductors","sourcePdf":"00870571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054035S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"73","articleId":"870571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":870675,"authors":[{"name":"J.

By using some appropriate iterative techniques, the formulation of the IDCT can be implemented effectively using recursive equations, and the hardware complexity is further reduced as compared with the approaches in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/18861/00870678.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/97.870678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/97.870678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=870678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient recursive algorithm for the inverse discrete cosine transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Very large scale integration","Kernel","Software algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Hardware","Filters","Discrete transforms","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","iterative methods","discrete cosine transforms","inverse problems","recursive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive algorithm","inverse discrete cosine transform","IDCT","iterative techniques","hardware complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Efficient recursive algorithm for the inverse discrete cosine transform","volume":"7","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6723026","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient recursive algorithm for the inverse discrete cosine transform","sourcePdf":"00870678.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042161S","chronDate":"Oct.  2000","isNumber":"18861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"7","articleId":"870678","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":870680,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The approach can be applied either in centrally controlled field buses or in synchronized ones.

However, when the global population is divided into small sub-populations, the ability of these sub-populations to evolve is set back because of their relatively small sizes. In this paper, a new method to manage the distributed populations in evolution is introduced. A supervising subroutine observes all the sub-populations during evolution. The sizes of these sub-populations are dynamically changed according to their performance. Better sub-populations get more quotas of the total number of individuals, thus get more possibility to produce even better ones. This algorithm is illustrated with an example. Different policies of managing the sub-populations are compared and discussed. The main conclusion is that dynamical rearrangement of the global population can make the process of evolution faster and more stable.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870775","startPage":"1132","endPage":"1136 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

Most of the evolutionary algorithms that have been proposed follow biological paradigms and the concepts of natural selection, mutation and reproduction. There are, however, other paradigms which may be adopted in the creation of evolutionary algorithms. Several problems involving unstructured environments may be addressed from the point of view of cultural paradigms, which offer plenty of categories of models where one does not know all possible solutions to a problem - a very common situation in real life. This work applies the computational properties of cultural technology to the solution of a specific problem, adapted from the robotics literature. A test environment denoted the \"Cultural Algorithms Simulator\" was developed to allow anyone to learn more about the rather unconventional characteristics of a cultural technology.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

We show a method of optimizing such portfolios by applying a bootstrap sampling approach to a database of individual algorithm performance on instances from a problem distribution.

GQA is based on the concept and principles of quantum computing such as qubits and superposition of states. Instead of binary, numeric, or symbolic representation, by adopting qubit chromosome as a representation GQA can represent a linear superposition of solutions due to its probabilistic representation. As genetic operators, quantum gates are employed for the search of the best solution. Rapid convergence and good global search capability characterize the performance of GQA. The effectiveness and the applicability of GQA are demonstrated by experimental results on the knapsack problem, which is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. The results show that GQA is superior to other genetic algorithms using penalty functions, repair methods and decoders.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

However, if the evolutionary process is combined with network learning, which is sensible both with respect to technical applications in dynamical environments and to the biological paragon, a way has to be found to combine learning with the evolutionary optimisation of such large structures. Utilising the development of neural systems during ontogeny seems a logical starting point for the realization of a step by step learning in networks. Furthermore, the combination of network growth during the developmental phase with an incremental problem complexity might allow the optimisation of large network structures together with learning. The author proposes a model to simulate such a combined approach and applies it to the problem of time series modelling. By introducing several measures for the transfer of information from one developmental step to the next, we will be able to quantitatively analyse the behaviour of the proposed model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/870823/","accessionNumber":"6735749","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary optimised ontogenetic neural networks with incremental problem complexity during development","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary optimised ontogenetic neural networks with incremental problem complexity during development","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00870823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03358S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6997","citationCount":"1","articleId":"870823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":870827,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Youl Lee","affiliation":["Department of Control and Instrumentation Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ki-Youl Lee","id":"37087564433"},{"name":"Dong-Wook Lee","affiliation":["Department of Control and Instrumentation Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-Wook Lee","id":"37087172526"},{"name":"Kwee-Bo Sim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwee-Bo Sim","id":"37087142818"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-6375-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"870827","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=870827","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","DNA","Biological neural networks","Biological system modeling","Genetics","Amino acids","Evolution (biology)","Biological information theory","RNA","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","evolutionary computation","time series","DNA","encoding","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary neural networks","time series prediction","L-system","DNA coding method","neural network construction","bio-inspired emergent concepts","evolutionary concepts","biological DNA","plant growth","production rule","parallel rewriting mechanism","Darwinian natural selection","population based search methods","solution space","one step ahead prediction","Mackey-Glass time series","Sun spot data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870827","pdfPath":"/iel5/6997/18853/00870827.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

Previous research has employed different neural networks to recognize various hand gestures. Due to their on-line adaptation capabilities, radial basis function networks are preferably over backpropagation. Unfortunately, the latter have shown better recognition rates. This paper applies evolutionary algorithms to fine tune pre-learned radial basis function networks. After optimization, the networks achieves a recognition rate of up to 100%, and is therefore comparable or even better than that of backpropagation networks.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2000.870835","pdfPath":"/iel5/6997/18853/00870835.pdf","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1534 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

This paper presents the results obtained during qualification tests on the first battery built for the STENTOR Satellite. The STENTOR satellite is powered by lithium-ion cells only, with two 45 V-80 Ah battery packs, made from cylindrical shaped 40 Ah lithium-ion cells, and including the electronics to monitor cells voltages and balance the cell to cell capacities. Each battery pack weights less than 37 kg. The required capacity is achieved by connecting two 40 Ah cells in parallel prior to connecting it in series. Then 11 of these group of two cells are series connected. The battery includes an automatic by-pass system to prevent any type of cell failure. The two electronics are cross strapped to ensure that the two battery packs have no single point failure. The first complete battery, built in 1999, was submitted for qualification test, which comprises: capacity test; hot and cold temperatures; thermal vacuum tests; vibration/shock tests; and EMC tests. The paper gives a summary of the development results, together with details and analysis of the qualification tests performed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Satellites","Qualifications","Testing","Joining processes","Monitoring","Voltage","Temperature","Electric shock","Electromagnetic compatibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space vehicle power plants","artificial satellites","lithium","secondary cells","aerospace testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Li-ion secondary batteries","geosynchronous satellites","STENTOR satellite","qualification testing","SAFT","battery pack","battery capacity","capacity test","thermal vacuum tests","vibration/shock tests","EMC tests","45 V","Li"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECEC.2000.870846","startPage":"621","endPage":"628 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Collection of Technical Papers. 35th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference and Exhibit (IECEC) (Cat.

On the basis of the equations, some basic issues, such as the relationship of voltage gain control and damping control, operating conditions and installation of STATCOM, are investigated by detailed theoretical analysis. Then with proportional controller for voltage and damping control, the digital simulation proves the necessity of multi-objective control of STATCOM in damping power system oscillations and supplying fast voltage support.

The admission control restricts the number of users in the system such that QoS requirements for all calls can be met. The flow control balances the system interference on a slot-by-slot basis such that bit error rate requirements are met for all users and the real-time users are given the highest priority. In this paper, we analyze the scenario of a single-cell DS-CDMA system carrying both voice and WWW users. A new admission control is proposed and analyzed for Web browsing sessions. The challenge in designing admission control for Web users is due to the fact that the Web traffic description is based on heavy tailed distributions. Thus, an accurate estimate for the average offered rate for a Web session is hard to compute. Our proposed admission scheme adaptively modifies the admission threshold at each time slot based on new average load measurements. The admission threshold is computed such that the probability of session dropping is maintained below a prescribed value. The flow control mechanism is an extension of the one proposed by C. Comaniciu et al. (2000), who used the residual capacity from voice users to allocate resources for WWW users.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo.

This algorithm operates on segments of a string representation. It is similar to both classical genetic algorithms that operate on bits of a string and genetic grouping algorithms that operate on subsets of a set. For evaluating segmentations, we define similarity adjacency functions, which are extremely expensive to optimize with traditional methods. The evolutionary nature of genetic algorithms offers a further advantage by enabling incremental segmentation. Applications include video summarization and indexing for browsing, plus adapting to user access patterns.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2000.871011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6974/18858/00871011.pdf","startPage":"1329","endPage":"1332 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo.

By employing a SIMD-like dual parallel pipelined data path which exploited the characteristics of the required computation of the FSR algorithm, the suggested processor shows about twice as much throughput at the same clock frequency compared with a single pipelined data path. Furthermore, it was implemented as a programmable processor rather than a dedicated architecture to a specific error number and length of code word, it has flexibility and extensibility regardless of the number of correctable errors/erasures and the length of code word. The suggested processor shows high-speed capability up to 320 MHz if implemented using 0.35 /spl mu/m technology. This high-speed nature can also be traded for lower-power consumption unless the aim of the application is high-speed explicitly by reducing the clock rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2000.871025","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo.

The architecture is parametrizable in terms of block size (N) and maximum search area size (p/sub max/) (the latter being also programmable in the range [1, p/sub max/]) thus permitting the implementation of a family of ICs suitable for QCIF, CIF, 4CIF image format processing. Two ASICs were realized on a 0.25 /spl mu/m, 2.5 V, CMOS technology able to process 30 frames/s QCIF, CIF, 4CIF formats with a search area of -16/+15. The resulting CIF and 4CIF ASICs feature a high throughput vs. area efficiency for a small hardware complexity and power consumption. The former, characterized by a core area of 1.6 mm/sup 2/, is able to process either QCIF and CIF with a clock frequency of 18 and 72 MHz, respectively, and with an estimated power consumption of about 42 and 170 mW. By exploiting the p programmability, it also processes the QCIF with a clock frequency of about 6 MHz and a power consumption of 15 mW resulting of a great interest for wireless multimedia applications.

We have developed a scene classification scheme using a hidden Markov model (HMM) based classifier. By utilizing the temporal behaviors of different scene classes, the HMM classifier can effectively classify video segments into one of the pre-defined scene classes.

Faultless fabric is a repetitive and regular global texture and Fourier transforms can be applied to monitor the spatial frequency spectrum of a fabric. When a defect occurs in fabric, its regular structure is changed so that the corresponding intensity at some specific positions of the frequency spectrum would change. However, the three-dimensional frequency spectrum is very difficult to analyze. In this paper, a simulated fabric model is used to understand the relationship between the fabric structure in the image space and in the frequency space. Based on the three-dimensional frequency spectrum, two significant spectral diagrams are defined and used for analyzing the fabric defect. These two diagrams are called the central spatial frequency spectrums. The defects are broadly classified into four classes: (1) double yarn; (2) missing yarn; (3) webs or broken fabric; and (4) yarn densities variation. After evaluating these four classes of defects using some simulated models and real samples, seven characteristic parameters for a central spatial frequency spectrum are extracted for defect classification.","doi":"10.1109/28.871274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/18871/00871274.pdf","startPage":"1267","endPage":"1276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.871274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabric defect detection by Fourier analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871274/","displayDocTitle":"Fabric defect detection by Fourier analysis","volume":"36","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6731141","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabric defect detection by Fourier analysis","sourcePdf":"00871274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043609S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2000","isNumber":"18871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"287","articleId":"871274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871276,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A neural network-based identification and control scheme is presented. A single artificial neural network is trained to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the motor. A control law is derived using the dynamics captured by the network, and employed to force the stator currents to follow prescribed trajectories. The proposed architecture adapts and generalizes its learning to a wide variety of loads and, in addition provides the necessary abstraction when measurements are contaminated with noise. Extensive simulations reveal that neural designs are effective means of system identification and control for time-varying nonlinear systems, in the presence of uncertainty. The effects of parameter changes on the performance of the network is addressed. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of sudden, random load torque changes. The difficulties addressed by this paper include incomplete system knowledge, nonlinearity, noise and delays.","doi":"10.1109/28.871276","startPage":"1285","endPage":"1294","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/18871/00871276.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.871276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive tracking controller for induction motor drives using online training of neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Induction motor drives","Stators","Artificial neural networks","Induction motors","Force control","Noise measurement","Pollution measurement","System identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","tracking","adaptive control","control system synthesis","machine theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","control system analysis","stators","nonlinear dynamical systems","machine control","time-varying systems","uncertain systems","identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","adaptive tracking controller","online training","neural networks","stator currents dynamics","identification","nonlinear dynamics","time-varying nonlinear systems","uncertainty","control design","control simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive tracking controller for induction motor drives using online training of neural networks","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6731143","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive tracking controller for induction motor drives using online training of neural networks","sourcePdf":"00871276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035962S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2000","isNumber":"18871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"8","articleId":"871276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871282,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Wang","affiliation":["GE Corporate Research and Development Center, Schenectady, NY, USA","GE Industrial Systems, Salem, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Fei Wang","id":"37087680715"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"871282","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":109,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":1148},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shafts","Pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Medium voltage","Grounding","System testing","Space vector pulse width modulation","Insulation","Coupling circuits","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","DC-AC power convertors","machine bearings","machine control","switching circuits","machine theory","machine testing","AC motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel MV PWM VSI drive","motor shaft voltages reduction","motor bearing currents reduction","common-mode voltages","PWM switching","motor windings","grounding scheme","common-mode filtering","motor shaft grounding"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents test results on problems and solutions of motor shaft voltages and bearing currents in medium-voltage pulsewidth modulated (PWM) drive systems.

Among these, the solutions based on the integration of a current signal (switch, diode, or inductor current) provide an inherent noise immunity, which makes them further appealing. This paper proposes a simple implementation of one such control technique for high-power-factor flyback, Cuk, or Sepic rectifiers, which, while still retaining a high power factor, further reduces the control complexity, thus making the solution very attractive for smart-power integration. A 200 W flyback rectifier with the proposed control technique was implemented and tested.

The rectifier consists of a conventional single-phase PWM voltage-source rectifier, a pair of additional switches and an inductor. Hence, the proposed rectifier requires neither a large DC capacitor nor a passive L-C resonant circuit. The input current control is achieved by the conventional PWM current control technique. However, DC ripple current reduction control is difficult because one of the switching legs in the DC ripple current reduction circuit is shared with the PWM rectifier circuit. Two control methods, referred to here as the DC C inductor method and the AC inductor method, are proposed for DC ripple reduction, and the characteristics of these control methods are discussed. These control methods are implemented using a microprocessor, and the effectiveness of the circuit is confirmed experimentally.

Check-off sheets are provided to assist in the orderly collection of data to assist in the analysis. As the petrochemical industry evolves from reactive to time based, to preventive, to trending, to diagnostics, and to a predictive maintenance attitude, more and more attention to root cause analysis will be required. This paper will help provide a platform for the establishment of such an evolution.

It is imperative, in all operations and manufacturing processes that downtime is avoided or minimized. If a problem does occur, the source of the problem is quickly identified and corrected. With proper knowledge and diagnostic procedures, it is normally possible to quickly pinpoint the cause of the vibration. All too often, erroneous conclusions are reached as a consequence of not understanding the root cause of the vibration. This may result in trying to fix an incorrectly diagnosed problem, spending a significant amount of time and money in the process. By utilizing the proper data collection and analysis techniques, the true source of the vibration can be discovered. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: electrical imbalance; mechanical unbalance-motor, coupling, or driven equipment; mechanical effects-looseness, rubbing, bearings, etc.; external effects-base, driven equipment, misalignment, etc.; resonance, critical speeds, reed critical, etc. Once the electrical and mechanical interactions in a motor are understood, and the influence external components have on the apparent motor vibration, identification of the offending component is usually straightforward. This paper provides an analytical approach for expeditiously understanding and solving these types of problems.","doi":"10.1109/28.871297","startPage":"1467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/18871/00871297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.871297","endPage":"1480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analytical approach to solving motor vibration problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871297/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"An analytical approach to solving motor vibration problems","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6731164","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical approach to solving motor vibration problems","sourcePdf":"00871297.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034922S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2000","isNumber":"18871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"119","articleId":"871297","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871301,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A functional architecture of hybrid control systems consisting of a continuous plant, a discrete-event controller, and an interface is used to introduce and describe analysis and synthesis concepts and approaches. Our approach highlights the interaction between the continuous and discrete dynamics, which is the cornerstone of any hybrid system study. Discrete abstractions are used to approximate the continuous plant. Properties of the discrete abstractions to be appropriate representations of the continuous plant are presented, and important concepts such as determinism and controllability are discussed.

This paper presents the embedded SRAM techniques for high-speed low-power MTCMOS/SIMOX application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs) that are operated with a single battery cell of around 1 V. In order to increase SRAM operating frequency, a pseudo-two stage pipeline architecture is proposed. The address decoder using a pass-transistor-type NAND gate and a segmented power switch presents a short clocked wordline selection time. The large bitline delay in read operations is greatly shortened with a new memory cell using extra low-V/sub th/ nMOSs. The small readout signal from memory cells is detected with a high-speed MTCMOS sense amplifier, in which a pMOS bitline selector is merged. The wasted power dissipation in writing data is reduced to zero with a self-timed writing action. A 8 K-words/spl times/16-bits SRAM test chip, fabricated with a 0.35-/spl mu/m MTCMOS/SIMOX process (shortened effective channel length of 0.17 /spl mu/m is available), has demonstrated a 100-MHz operation under the worst power-supply condition of 1 V. At a typical 1.2 V, the power dissipation during the standby time is 0.2-/spl mu/W and that of a 100-MHz operation with a checkerboard test pattern is 14 mW for single fan-in loads.","doi":"10.1109/4.871315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.871315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/18873/00871315.pdf","startPage":"1396","endPage":"1407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1-V 100-MHz embedded SRAM techniques for battery-operated MTCMOS/SIMOX ASICs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2000","displayDocTitle":"1-V 100-MHz embedded SRAM techniques for battery-operated MTCMOS/SIMOX ASICs","volume":"35","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6738507","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871315/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1-V 100-MHz embedded SRAM techniques for battery-operated MTCMOS/SIMOX ASICs","sourcePdf":"00871315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074829S","chronDate":"Oct.  2000","isNumber":"18873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"11","articleId":"871315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":871316,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Kyung Wee","affiliation":["Memory Research and Development, Hyundai Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Kyung Wee","id":"37087168397"},{"name":"Woodward Yang","affiliation":["Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Woodward Yang","id":"37087257695"},{"name":"Eui-Kyu Ryou","affiliation":["Memory Research and Development, Hyundai Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Eui-Kyu Ryou","id":"37088040083"},{"name":"Joe-Sun Choi","affiliation":["Memory Research and Development, Hyundai Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joe-Sun Choi","id":"37087745780"},{"name":"Seung-Han Ahn","affiliation":["Memory Research and Development, Hyundai Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Han Ahn","id":"37087314618"},{"name":"Jin-Yong Chung","affiliation":["Memory Research and Development, Hyundai Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Yong Chung","id":"37087195093"},{"name":"Sea-Chung Kim","affiliation":["Memory Research and Development, Hyundai Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sea-Chung Kim","id":"37087256840"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"871316","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":342},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["EPROM","Circuits","Random access memory","Dynamic programming","Capacitors","SDRAM","Power generation","Latches","Decoding","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EPROM","redundancy","DRAM chips","decoding","capacitance","semiconductor device breakdown","impedance matching","integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antifuse EPROM circuitry scheme","field-programmable repair","DRAM","SDRAM specifications","internal high-voltage generator","dynamic sense and static latch scheme","redundant DRAM address decoders","high voltage generation","high-voltage-tolerant capacitor structure","fringing capacitance","intralevel lines","interlevel lines","polysilicon lines","metal lines","destructive dielectric breakdown","ONO dielectric","memory repair","output impedance matching","data encryption","3 V","0.22 micron","64 Mbit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871316","abstract":"An antifuse EPROM and 3-V programming circuit has been demonstrated in an existing 0.22-/spl mu/m DRAM process technology and is fully compatible with 64-Mb SDRAM specifications. The antifuse circuitry uses an internal high-voltage generator for programming and a dynamic sense and static latch scheme that appropriately enables redundant DRAM address decoders at power-up. For efficient high voltage generation, a high-voltage-tolerant capacitor structure was formed by using the high fringing capacitance available between intralevel and interlevel polysilicon and metal lines. Furthermore, the programmable EPROM element was realized without any process modifications by utilizing destructive dielectric breakdown of the thin, highly reliable oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) dielectric in the basic DRAM cell capacitor structure. This antifuse EPROM circuit enables implementation of field-programmable DRAM features such as memory repair, output impedance matching, and data encryption.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18873","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/18873/00871316.pdf","doi":"10.1109/4.871316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.871316","startPage":"1408","endPage":"1414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An antifuse EPROM circuitry scheme for field-programmable repair in DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871316/","displayDocTitle":"An antifuse EPROM circuitry scheme for field-programmable repair in DRAM","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"6738508","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An antifuse EPROM circuitry scheme for field-programmable repair in DRAM","sourcePdf":"00871316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036335S","chronDate":"Oct.  2000","isNumber":"18873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"25","articleId":"871316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871317,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In fully integrated PLLs, the VCO output frequency should be tunable over a wide range of frequencies, covering the desired range of the synthesizer output frequencies, for all processing variations and operating conditions. A wide tuning range realized by making the VCO gain K/sub o/ large has the unwanted effect of increasing the phase noise at the output of the VCO, and hence the PLL as well. In this work, the wide tuning range is realized by digital control, with process variability managed through self-calibration. The PLL is only required to pull the oscillator output frequency to account for the digital quantization, temperature variations, and some margin. This allows the K/sub o/ to be small, with better noise performance resulting. The prototype self-calibrating frequency synthesizer, capable of operating from 80 MHz to 1 GHz, demonstrates a measured absolute jitter of 20-ps rms at 480-MHz operating frequency.

The methodology is applied to a number of cases of interest in power quality, demonstrating that harmonics of the fundamental frequency can be recovered without error, and that effective descriptions are possible for flicker, sag, interharmonics, and noisy measurements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power quality","Monitoring","Signal processing algorithms","Sampling methods","Digital signal processing","Frequency","Power measurement","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supply quality","power system measurement","signal sampling","signal reconstruction","fast Fourier transforms","time-domain analysis","frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["staggered undersampling","power quality monitoring","sparse samples","FFT","spectral calculations","time domain","dual inverse shuffling","frequency domain","fundamental frequency harmonics","flicker","sag","interharmonics","noisy measurements","signal sampling","signal reconstruction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/61.871345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/18875/00871345.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.871345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of staggered undersampling to power quality monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of staggered undersampling to power quality monitoring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871345/","volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6731784","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of staggered undersampling to power quality monitoring","sourcePdf":"00871345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037182S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"13","articleId":"871345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":871350,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

The FNN can be viewed either as a fuzzy system, a neural network or fuzzy neural network. The structure is seen as a neural network for training and a fuzzy viewpoint is utilized to gain insight into the system and to simplify the model. The number of rules is determined by the data itself and therefore a smaller number of rules is produced. The network is trained with the backpropagation algorithm. A pruning strategy is applied to eliminate the redundant rules and fuzzification neurons, consequently a compact structure is achieved. The classification and location tasks are accomplished by using different FNN's. Once the fault type is identified by the FNN classifier the selected fault locating FNN estimates the location of the fault accurately. Normalized peaks of fundamental voltage and current waveforms are considered as inputs to all the networks and an additional input derived from the DC component is fed to fault locating networks. The peaks and DC component are extracted from sampled signals by the EKF. Test results show that the new approach provides robust and accurate classification/location of faults for a variety of power system operating conditions even with resistance in the fault path.","doi":"10.1109/61.871350","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/18875/00871350.pdf","startPage":"902","endPage":"907","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.871350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel fuzzy neural network based distance relaying scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","displayDocTitle":"A novel fuzzy neural network based distance relaying scheme","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6731789","publicationDate":"July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel fuzzy neural network based distance relaying scheme","sourcePdf":"00871350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049877S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"79","articleId":"871350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":871355,"authors":[{"name":"Tongxin Zheng","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"lastName":"Tongxin Zheng","id":"37087871741"},{"name":"E.B.

The integrated model is divided into three parts, the supply system model, the nonlinear load model and the controller model. First, the supply system is represented by a set of linear differential equations. Simulation is achieved by a numerical method and the measurements are taken as the control input. Secondly, based on the arc melting process and typical arc furnace V-I characteristic, the arc furnace load is described as a current-controlled nonlinear resistance. The pattern of nonlinear resistance is controlled by the average arc length, which reflects the arc furnace operating condition. Finally, the rectangular approximation of arc voltage is adopted by the controller to generate the arc power-arc length and the arc current-arc length curves. This information combined with the arc furnace operation and measurement information is used for the control scheme to determine the arc length and arc furnace transformer tap. Thus, the proposed adaptive arc furnace model is suitable for different operating conditions. This model is also compared prith the existing arc furnace models, which provides its validity. The effect of arc furnace load on the power system is also studied through the proposed model.","doi":"10.1109/61.871355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/18875/00871355.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.871355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18875","startPage":"931","endPage":"939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive arc furnace model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive arc furnace model","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871355/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6731794","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive arc furnace model","sourcePdf":"00871355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048532S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"82","articleId":"871355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871359,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In both cases, they are able to accurately determine on which side of a recording device the disturbance originates. If enough recording devices are available in a network, the individual readings can be collectively used to pinpoint the locations of disturbance sources.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/18875/00871378.pdf","startPage":"1081","endPage":"1086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.871378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.871378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18875","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direction finder for power quality disturbances based upon disturbance power and energy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power quality","Voltage fluctuations","Load flow","Power engineering and energy","Power system harmonics","Power capacitors","Testing","Variable speed drives","Microprocessors","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power distribution faults","power supply quality","fault location"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power quality disturbances","direction finder","disturbance power","disturbance energy","power distribution","disturbance sources location","sampled current waveforms","sampled voltage waveforms","recording device","energy flow","peak instantaneous power","capacitor energizing disturbances","voltage sag disturbances","ATP-generated waveforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","displayDocTitle":"A direction finder for power quality disturbances based upon disturbance power and energy","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6731817","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A direction finder for power quality disturbances based upon disturbance power and energy","sourcePdf":"00871378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036042S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"109","articleId":"871378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871382,"authors":[{"name":"J.X.

In order to improve the frequency diversity capability for the proposed multicarrier MFSK/FH-CDMA system, several hopping frequencies per time slot are employed and transmitted in parallel. The frequency band is partitioned into N (N/spl les/P, P is a prime number) disjoint subbands on which N hop carrier frequencies are simultaneously transmitted. In previous work on multicarrier systems, it has been assumed that the hopping frequencies of N disjoint subbands are identical. We consider the FH patterns without this assumption. These FH patterns have cross correlation no greater than one in order to minimize mutual interference. In addition, we analyze the performance of the system in order to show the improvement of user capacity.

The problem of performing ID for systems having parametric uncertainty has received relatively little attention in the open literature. Previously proposed adaptive SISO (A-SISO) algorithms are either based on an oversimplified channel model, or have a complexity that grows exponentially with the observation length N (or the smoothing lag D). In this paper, the exact expressions for the soft metrics in the presence of parametric uncertainty modeled as a Gauss-Markov process are derived in a novel way that enables the decoupling of complexity and observation length. Starting from these expressions, a family of suboptimal (practical) algorithms is motivated, based on forward/backward adaptive processing with linear complexity in N. Previously proposed A-SISO algorithms, as well as existing adaptive hard decision algorithms are interpreted as special cases within this framework. Using a representative application-joint iterative equalization-decoding for trellis-based codes over frequency-selective channels-several design options are compared and the impact of parametric uncertainty on previously established results for ID with perfect channel state information is assessed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive soft-input soft-output algorithms for iterative detection with parametric uncertainty","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.871389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18877/00871389.pdf","startPage":"1638","endPage":"1649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.871389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871389/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive soft-input soft-output algorithms for iterative detection with parametric uncertainty","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6766249","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive soft-input soft-output algorithms for iterative detection with parametric uncertainty","sourcePdf":"00871389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042745S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"77","articleId":"871389","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871391,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Estimator structures for both real and complex channels are examined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871393/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","volume":"48","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"6766253","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of SNR estimation techniques for the AWGN channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of SNR estimation techniques for the AWGN channel","sourcePdf":"00871393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034852S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"563","articleId":"871393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":871394,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Ho Kim","affiliation":["Advanced Telecommunication Research Laboratory, LG Information and Communications Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung Ho Kim","id":"38024831700"},{"name":"Sang Wu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Wu Kim","id":"37085287700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"871394","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":337},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rayleigh channels","Bandwidth","Fading","Multiple access interference","Frequency conversion","Personal communication networks","Radio frequency","Radio transmitters","Capacity planning","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency hop communication","multi-access systems","amplitude shift keying","Rayleigh channels","radiofrequency interference","error statistics","channel capacity","frequency shift keying","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-hopped multiple-access communications","multicarrier on-off keying","Rayleigh fading channels","MC-OOK","bandwidth-efficient modulation method","frequency-hopped multiple-access","FHMA communications","frequency slots","multiple-access interference immunity","average bit-error probability","slow frequency-nonselective Rayleigh fading channels","background noise","capacity gain","MFSK/FHMA system","interference-limited region","modulation alphabet size","white Gaussian background noise"]}],"abstract":"We propose the multicarrier on-off keying (MC-OOK) as a bandwidth-efficient modulation method for frequency-hopped multiple-access (FHMA) communications.

Markov sequence decoders employing the Viterbi algorithm that use first-order source statistics are reviewed, and generalized for decoders that use second-order source statistics. To make optimal use of the source correlation in both horizontal and vertical directions, it is necessary to generalize the conventional Viterbi decoding algorithm for a one higher-dimensional trellis. The paths through the trellis become two-dimensional \"sheets\", thus, the technique is coined \"sheet decoding\". By objective [reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] and subjective measure, it is found that the sheet decoders outperform the Markov sequence decoders that use a first-order Markov model, and outperform two other known decoders (modified maximum a posteriori probability and maximal SNR) that use a second-order Markov model. Moreover, it is found that the use of a simple rate-2/3 block code in conjunction with Markov model-aided decoding (MMAD) offers significant performance improvement for a 2-bit DPCM system. For the example Lenna image, it is observed that the rate-2/3 block code is superior to a rate-2/3 convolutional code for channel-error rates higher than 0.035. The block code is easily incorporated into any of the MMAD DPCM systems and results in a 2-bit MMAD DPCM system that significantly outperforms the noncoded 3-bit MMAD DPCM systems for channel-error rates higher than 0.04.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18877/00871395.pdf","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.871395","doi":"10.1109/26.871395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal use of Markov models for DPCM picture transmission over noisy channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Optimal use of Markov models for DPCM picture transmission over noisy channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871395/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6766255","volume":"48","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal use of Markov models for DPCM picture transmission over noisy channels","sourcePdf":"00871395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036491S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","articleId":"871395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871396,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Motivated by this fact, we propose a new two-stage NDA scheme where symbol-by-symbol predecisions at the output of a first adaptive stage are used to train a second stage. We derive closed-form steady-state performance analysis for both the two-stage and classical decision-directed schemes, taking into account detection errors in decision-directed adaptation. Our analysis shows that the SINR of the two-stage algorithm is close to optimal over a large range of values, while the SINR of the decision-directed scheme is far from optimal when the optimal SINR is small. Finally, we consider the case of time-varying fading channels. We derive modified recursive least square and least mean square adaptation schemes by considering SINR maximization rather than MSE minimization (that is useless under the assumption of zero-mean random channels). The resulting two-stage receiver shows good tracking properties in heavy near-far conditions (at least for moderate normalized Doppler bandwidth), while the decision-directed receiver may easily loose tracking after deep fades.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18877/00871396.pdf","startPage":"1712","endPage":"1724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.871396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.871396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-stage nondata-aided adaptive linear receivers for DS/CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Signal to noise ratio","Steady-state","Performance analysis","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Degradation","Algorithm design and analysis","Fading","Least squares methods","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","multiuser channels","time-varying channels","fading channels","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","mean square error methods","adaptive systems","radio tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage receivers","nondata-aided adaptive linear receivers","DS/CDMA","closed-form steady-state performance analysis","signal-to-interference plus noise ratio","SINR","linear minimum mean-square error","LMSE receiver","direct-sequence code-division multiple access","performance degradation","symbol-by-symbol predecisions","detection errors","decision-directed adaptation","time-varying fading channels","modified recursive least square adaptation","modified least mean square adaptation","SINR maximization","tracking properties","heavy near-far conditions","normalized Doppler bandwidth","decision-directed receiver","deep fades"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Two-stage nondata-aided adaptive linear receivers for DS/CDMA","volume":"48","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6766256","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-stage nondata-aided adaptive linear receivers for DS/CDMA","sourcePdf":"00871396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070542S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","articleId":"871396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":871397,"authors":[{"name":"S.N.

A powerful frequency-domain approach is therefore developed in which the average error-rate integral is transformed into the frequency domain, using Parseval's theorem. Such a transformation eliminates the need for computing (or approximating) the EGC output PDF (which is unknown), but instead requires the knowledge of the corresponding characteristic function (which is readily available). The frequency-domain method also circumvents the need to perform multiple-fold convolution integral operations, usually encountered in the calculation of the PDF of the sum of the received signal amplitudes. We then derive integral expressions for the average symbol-error rate of an arbitrary two-dimensional signaling scheme, with EGC reception in Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m (1960), and Nakagami-q fading channels. For practically important cases of second- and third-order diversity systems in Nakagami fading, both coherent and noncoherent detection methods for binary signaling are analyzed using the Appell hypergeometric function. A number of closed-form solutions are derived in which the results put forward by Zhang (see ibid., vol.45, p.270-73, 1997) are shown to be special cases.","doi":"10.1109/26.871398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.871398","startPage":"1732","endPage":"1745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18877/00871398.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equal-gain diversity receiver performance in wireless channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Equal-gain diversity receiver performance in wireless channels","volume":"48","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6766258","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equal-gain diversity receiver performance in wireless channels","sourcePdf":"00871398.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054293S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"177","articleId":"871398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":871399,"authors":[{"name":"J.

As a consequence, a completely analytical procedure to evaluate error probability is also obtained and illustrated using OFDM/discrete multitone modulation (DMT) systems with rectangular pulse shaping; for the soft-envelope limiter nonlinearity, a closed form is derived. A comparison with simulation results is carried out to verify the accuracy of this method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","volume":"48","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"6766260","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A theoretical characterization of nonlinear distortion effects in OFDM systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theoretical characterization of nonlinear distortion effects in OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"00871400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051309S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"433","articleId":"871400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":871402,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

This work provides a design for an asynchronous BCI switch and performs the first extensive evaluation of an asynchronous device in attentive, spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The switch design [named the low-frequency asynchronous switch design (LF-ASD)] is based on a new feature set related to imaginary movements in the 1-4 Hz frequency range. This new feature set was identified from a unique analysis of EEG using a bi-scale wavelet. Offline evaluations of a prototype switch demonstrated hit (true positive) rates in the range of 38%-81% with corresponding false positive rates in the range of 0.3%-11.6%. The performance of the LF-ASD was contrasted with two other ASDs: one based on mu-power features and another based on the outlier processing method (OPM) algorithm. The minimum mean error rates for the LF-ASD were shown to be significantly lower than either of these other two switch designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/18878/00871402.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.871402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.871402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18878","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A brain-controlled switch for asynchronous control applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Electroencephalography","Brain computer interfaces","Signal design","Performance evaluation","Frequency","Wavelet analysis","Prototypes","Variable speed drives","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","switches","biocontrol","handicapped aids","wavelet transforms","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-controlled switch","asynchronous control applications","brain-computer interface","attentive spontaneous electroencephalographic signals","low-frequency asynchronous switch design","feature set","imaginary movements","bi-scale wavelet","offline evaluations","hit rates","true positive rates","false positive rates","mu-power features","outlier processing method algorithm","minimum mean error rates","1 to 4 Hz"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Algorithms","Communication Aids for Disabled","Electrodes","Electroencephalography","Equipment Design","Humans","Male","Motor Cortex","ROC Curve","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","User-Computer Interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2000","displayDocTitle":"A brain-controlled switch for asynchronous control applications","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6731075","pubMedId":"11059164","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A brain-controlled switch for asynchronous control applications","sourcePdf":"00871402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03967S","chronDate":"Oct.  2000","isNumber":"18878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"207","articleId":"871402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":871403,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The ASEC algorithm is based on analysis by synthesis coding, and consists of a beat codebook, long and short-term predictors, and an adaptive residual quantizer. The compression algorithm uses a defined distortion measure in order to efficiently encode every heartbeat, with minimum bit rate, while maintaining a predetermined distortion level. The compression algorithm was implemented and tested with both the percentage rms difference (PRD) measure and the recently introduced weighted diagnostic distortion (WDD) measure. The compression algorithm has been evaluated with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. A mean compression rate of approximately 100 bits/s (compression ratio of about 30:1) has been achieved with a good reconstructed signal quality (WDD below 4% and PRD below 8%). The ASEC was compared with several well-known ECG compression algorithms and was found to be superior at all tested bit rates. A mean opinion score (MOS) test was also applied. The testers were three independent expert cardiologists. As In the quantitative test, the proposed compression algorithm was found to be superior to the other tested compression algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/18878/00871403.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.871403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.871403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18878","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG signal compression using analysis by synthesis coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Signal analysis","Signal synthesis","Compression algorithms","Testing","Distortion measurement","Algorithm design and analysis","Bit rate","Heart beat","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","data compression","medical signal processing","encoding","electrocardiography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG signal compression","analysis by synthesis coding","beat codebook","adaptive residual quantizer","MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database","reconstructed signal quality","bit rate","percentage rms difference measure","electrodiagnostics"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Arrhythmias, Cardiac","Databases as Topic","Electrocardiography","Humans","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2000","displayDocTitle":"ECG signal compression using analysis by synthesis coding","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6731076","pubMedId":"11059165","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG signal compression using analysis by synthesis coding","sourcePdf":"00871403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047989S","chronDate":"Oct.  2000","isNumber":"18878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"111","articleId":"871403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871415,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Hwan Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyung Hwan Kim","id":"37676888300"},{"name":"Sung June Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung June Kim","id":"37279278000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"871415","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":144,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1561},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Signal to noise ratio","Subspace constraints","Extracellular","Electrodes","Circuit noise","Semiconductor device noise","1f noise","Neurons","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurophysiology","neural nets","signal classification","bioelectric potentials","cellular biophysics","vectors","biological techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural spike sorting","nearly 0-dB signal-to-noise ratio","nonlinear energy operator","artificial neural-network classifier","training set","simple amplitude thresholding","statistical characteristics","input vectors","correct classification ratio","extracellular recording","Aplysia abdominal ganglia","semiconductor microelectrode array","neuroscience method","biological research technique"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Animals","Aplysia","Nerve Net","Neural Conduction","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"Reports a result on neural spike sorting under conditions where the signal-to-noise ratio is very low.

We show that block errors can be accurately modeled by a first-order Markov process. Although Markov models have been used before to analyze packet transmission over radio channels, they have not been applied to CDMA systems that incorporate convolutional codes (CC) with soft-decision decoding. A major contribution of this work is to include in the new Markov model the effects of the CC, soft-decision decoding, and the RAKE diversity fingers with maximal ratio combining. The validity and accuracy of the model are established based on information-theoretic arguments and confirmed by computer simulation. A method to estimate the Markov process parameters is also presented. Another major contribution of this paper is the analysis of the throughput of the go-back-N and selective-repeat automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols over DS-CDMA systems using the proposed Markov model. Several cases involving different numbers of RAKE fingers and various values of round-trip delays are analyzed. Our approximation is found to be excellent in all cases. The study of multimedia transmission, especially video, over DS-CDMA channels is greatly simplified using the model introduced in this work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation in multimedia CDMA wireless transmission","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo.

The model makes use of a density-matrix gain calculation, and takes into account the forward and backward amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectra and the spatial carrier hole-burning. The device is longitudinally divided into M sections and a rate equation for averaged photon and carrier densities is used for each section. We demonstrate that the accuracy on the calculated noise figure strictly depends on the number of sections M. We obtain a good tradeoff between the results accuracy and the computational complexity with M=8. The model is then applied to study the noise in a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR)-type gain-clamped SOA for varying signal power, pump current, and lasing wavelength. We show that changes in the spatial carrier profile caused by the input signal significantly affect the noise figure, even when the gain is constant. A slight dependence of the noise figure on lasing wavelength is also foreseen, while the dependence on the pump current is negligible. A new method for gain-clamped SOA noise figure reduction is proposed, based on unbalanced Bragg reflectors. An improvement of noise figure (NF) as large as 2 dB is devised.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6744055","volume":"18","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noise analysis of conventional and gain-clamped semiconductor optical amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise analysis of conventional and gain-clamped semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00871703.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035716S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"50","articleId":"871703","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":871705,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Summerfield","affiliation":["Australian Photonics Cooperative Research Centre, Photonics Research Laboratory,  Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Summerfield","id":"37265300700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"871705","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":54},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stimulated emission","Optical noise","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Noise figure","Optical modulation","Amplitude modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Fluctuations","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical noise","optical modulation","optical fibre amplifiers","optical fibre communication","laser noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical amplifier noise figure reduction","optical single-sideband signals","noise figure","quantum limit","single-sideband modulation","optical communications systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871705","abstract":"In a recent paper (see Proc.

The interferogram restoration was used to reduce the effect of the group-velocity dispersion of the waveguide. It was based on a wavenumber scale transformation or a dispersion balance between two arms in the interferometer. We derived a criterion for choosing the appropriate restoration method by estimating the worst-case measurement error in the presence of second order dispersion. After selecting a method using the derived criterion, we obtained isolated fringe patterns, from which we were able to obtain the phase and amplitude distributions in 50 and 200 GHz AWGs. Using the obtained distributions, we examined the origin of the crosstalk and chromatic dispersion in InP-based AWGs.

The objective is to determine the minimum investment required to satisfy suitable reactive constraints. Due to the discrete nature of reactive compensation devices, optimal capacitor placement leads to a nonlinear programming problem with mixed (discrete and continuous) variables. It is solved with an iterative algorithm based on successive linearizations of the original nonlinear model. The mixed integer linear programming problem to be solved at each iteration of the procedure is tackled by applying both a deterministic method (branch and bound) and genetic algorithm techniques. A hybrid procedure, aiming to exploit the best features of both algorithms is also considered. The proposed procedures are tested and compared with reference to a small CIGRE system and two actual networks derived from the Italian transmission and distribution system.","doi":"10.1109/59.871731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.871731","endPage":"1046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/18883/00871731.pdf","startPage":"1041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal capacitor placement using deterministic and genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871731/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal capacitor placement using deterministic and genetic algorithms","volume":"15","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6731840","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal capacitor placement using deterministic and genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00871731.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044211S","chronDate":"Aug.  2000","isNumber":"18883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"115","articleId":"871731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871734,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The objective is to maximize the unit profit from selling both energy and spinning reserve in the spot market. The paper proposes a 0/1 mixed-integer linear programming approach that allows a rigorous modeling of (i) nonconvex and nondifferentiable operating costs, (ii) exponential start-up costs, (iii) available spinning reserve taking into account ramp rate restrictions, and (iv) minimum up and down time constraints. This approach overcomes the modeling limitations of dynamic programming approaches and is computationally efficient.

The objective here is to quickly assess the effects of large numbers of contingencies (line outages) to determine the worst case. The methodology is intuitively focused on the relationship between a node voltage and the availability of reactive power in the local neighborhood, and it also takes advantage of other information from the power flow solution. The concept of electrical distance is introduced for choosing the corresponding voltage control area locally around the contingency event. For the calculation of post-contingency electrical distance and power flow, the computation efficiency can be achieved by utilizing many mature algorithms from static security analysis (SSA).","doi":"10.1109/59.871745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/18883/00871745.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.871745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18883","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast voltage security assessment method using adaptive bounding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fast voltage security assessment method using adaptive bounding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2000","accessionNumber":"6731854","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast voltage security assessment method using adaptive bounding","sourcePdf":"00871745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03463S","chronDate":"Aug.  2000","isNumber":"18883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"43","articleId":"871745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":871753,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Examples include satellite and underwater vehicle control systems with the number of control inputs less than the dimension of the configuration space. Local controllability properties of these systems are characterized, and two algebraic tests are derived in terms of the symmetric product and the Lie bracket of the input vector fields. Perturbation theory is applied to compute approximate solutions for the system under small-amplitude forcing; in-phase signals play a crucial role in achieving motion along symmetric product directions. Motion control algorithms are then designed to solve problems of point-to-point reconfiguration, static interpolation and exponential stabilization. We illustrate the theoretical results and the algorithms with applications to models of planar rigid bodies, satellites and underwater vehicles.","doi":"10.1109/9.871753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.871753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18884","startPage":"1437","endPage":"1454","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/18884/00871753.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=871753","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Controllability","Lagrangian functions","Motion control","Control systems","System testing","Satellites","Underwater vehicles","Kinetic energy","Algorithm design and analysis","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllability","motion control","Lie groups","stability","nonlinear control systems","artificial satellites","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion algorithms","underactuated Lagrangian systems","Lie groups","controllability tests","underactuated mechanical control systems","kinetic energy","underwater vehicle control systems","satellite control systems","configuration space","local controllability properties","Lie bracket","input vector fields","perturbation theory","small-amplitude forcing","in-phase signals","symmetric product directions","point-to-point reconfiguration","static interpolation","exponential stabilization","planar rigid bodies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Controllability and motion algorithms for underactuated Lagrangian systems on Lie groups","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2000","accessionNumber":"6730992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/871753/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controllability and motion algorithms for underactuated Lagrangian systems on Lie groups","sourcePdf":"00871753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041239S","chronDate":"Aug 2000","isNumber":"18884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"142","articleId":"871753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":871816,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Today, most companies are focusing on one or two of these essential ingredients, leaving a major gap in their ability to understand how change will impact their business in what is now an explosive period of technological and sociological change. They need to better leverage their strategic knowledge in order to dramatically improve their technology management capability. However, this knowledge is either missing, localized to a few experts, hidden in documents, or is untrustworthy since it is out of date, of questionable quality or has no clear accountable source. This paper describes work that Motorola Labs is pioneering in providing an integrated, strategic decision-making, requirements management and roadmapping process. To make this process realizable within a large enterprise, a set of methods and tools have been developed to support the process. While this paper focuses on technology management, this approach can and is being applied across other processes such as strategy development, research management, system architecture and platform development as well as market and product planning.","doi":"10.1109/EMS.2000.872498","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Engineering Management Society.

Multi-frame techniques, such as microscanning, are an effective means of reducing aliasing and increasing resolution in images produced by staring imaging systems. These techniques involve interlacing a set of image frames that have been shifted with respect to each other during acquisition. The FLIR system is mounted on a moving platform, such as an aircraft, and the vibrations associated with the platform are used to generate the shifts. Since a fixed number of image frames is required, and the shifts are random, the acquired frames will not fall on a uniformly spaced grid. Furthermore, some of the acquired frames may have almost similar shifts thus making them unusable for high-resolution image reconstruction. In this paper, we utilize a gradient-based registration algorithm to estimate the shifts between the acquired frames and then use a weighted nearest-neighbor approach for placing the frames onto a uniform grid to form a final high-resolution image. Blurring by the detector and optics of the imaging system limits the increase in image resolution when microscanning is attempted at sub-pixel movements of less than half the detector width. We resolve this difficulty by the application of the Wiener filter, designed using the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the imaging system, to the high-resolution image. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The techniques proposed herein are significantly faster than alternate techniques, and are found to be especially suitable for real-time applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/18892/00872908.pdf","doi":"10.1109/19.872908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.872908","startPage":"915","endPage":"923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Infrared image registration and high-resolution reconstruction using multiple translationally shifted aliased video frames","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/872908/","displayDocTitle":"Infrared image registration and high-resolution reconstruction using multiple translationally shifted aliased video frames","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6738569","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Infrared image registration and high-resolution reconstruction using multiple translationally shifted aliased video frames","sourcePdf":"00872908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041159S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"108","articleId":"872908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":872919,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This laboratory has been devised on the basis of de-facto networking standards so that students are required to use only a simple commercial Internet Web browser. Moreover, a concurrence of more users on the same measuring setup is allowed. The remote laboratory concept allows measuring resources located at different geographically remote sites to be utilized by a wide distribution of students. In this way, a more complete educational proposal can be economically offered by several geographically remote laboratories specialized in different measuring fields.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/18892/00872919.pdf","startPage":"992","endPage":"997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/19.872919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.872919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=872919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A measurement laboratory on geographic network for remote test experiments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Instruments","Education","Remote laboratories","World Wide Web","Electric variables measurement","Application software","Hardware","Costs","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telemetry","Internet","laboratories","student experiments","computerised instrumentation","multiprocessing systems","computer architecture","piezoelectric transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement laboratory","geographic network","remote test experiments","remote laboratory","automatic measuring setup","networking standards","Internet Web browser","education","geographically remote laboratories","computer networks","piezoelectric transducers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/872919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"A measurement laboratory on geographic network for remote test experiments","volume":"49","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6738580","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A measurement laboratory on geographic network for remote test experiments","sourcePdf":"00872919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077621S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"62","articleId":"872919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":872926,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Several causes of inaccuracy are analyzed and characterized so that the expressions of different components of error on the power spectral density (psd) estimate are given, in terms both of spectral properties of noise and typical parameters of the used filter. These simple expressions point out how an appropriate choice of some window parameters may increase considerably the accuracy of the estimate. The effects of choice on the accuracy are examined. In any case, the performance of the psd estimator can be improved by adopting linear or nonlinear averaging techniques; in the paper the statistical properties of geometric mean of periodograms are particularly examined and compared with those of the more traditional Welch's method. It is proved that, under appropriate conditions, the geometric mean produces a reduction both of bias and variance of psd. Numerical simulations confirm these theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/19.872926","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/18892/00872926.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.872926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","startPage":"1036","endPage":"1042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on nonlinear averagings to perform the characterization of power spectral density estimation algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=872926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"A study on nonlinear averagings to perform the characterization of power spectral density estimation algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/872926/","volume":"49","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6738587","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on nonlinear averagings to perform the characterization of power spectral density estimation algorithms","sourcePdf":"00872926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048608S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"13","articleId":"872926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":872929,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this paper, a full-blown broadband WLL network is presented. The proposal is based on the OFDM-CDMA technique, to which an added dynamic reservation/request MAC protocol is proposed, fully exploiting the OFDM-CDMA platform. Central to our proposal is the support of different QoS profiles, in the context of QoS aware networks. As a case study, the explicit presentation of the IETF integrated services support over our WLL system is addressed. An extensive performance evaluation focused on the MAC layer is then reported. We prove that our scheme achieves high utilization efficiency, as well as a fair share of the available radio capacity, even in the presence of highly heterogeneous traffic mix. Delay performance is provided for both reference traffic models, as well as for measured IP and MPEG traffic traces offered to the system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/18893/00872950.pdf","startPage":"1608","endPage":"1622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.872950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.872950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=872950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IP QoS delivery in a broadband wireless local loop: MAC protocol definition and performance evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Telecommunication traffic","Access protocols","Traffic control","Bandwidth","Intelligent networks","Proposals","Intserv networks","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","access protocols","code division multiple access","Internet","quality of service","radio access networks","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP QoS delivery","broadband wireless local loop","MAC protocol definition","performance evaluation","last mile access","WLL","broadband services","OFDM-CDMA","dynamic reservation/request MAC protocol","IETF integrated services support","utilization efficiency","available radio capacity","delay performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/872950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","displayDocTitle":"IP QoS delivery in a broadband wireless local loop: MAC protocol definition and performance evaluation","volume":"18","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6737420","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IP QoS delivery in a broadband wireless local loop: MAC protocol definition and performance evaluation","sourcePdf":"00872950.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057005S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"10","articleId":"872950","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":872953,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Lin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineerig, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shih-Lin Wu","id":"37281058100"},{"name":"Yu-Chee Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Chee Tseng","id":"37276276400"},{"name":"Jang-Ping Sheu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineerig, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jang-Ping Sheu","id":"37274527100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"872953","dbTime":"83 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":174,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":505},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=872953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Mobile ad hoc networks","Power control","Media Access Protocol","Access protocols","Batteries","Interchannel interference","Computer science","Analytical models","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cochannel interference","power control","telecommunication control","land mobile radio","packet radio networks","frequency allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent medium access","mobile ad hoc networks","power control","MANET","channel utilization","hidden-terminal problem","exposed-terminal problem","MAC protocols","RTS/CTS-based protocol","busy-tone-based protocol","power level","packets","channel reuse","discrete power levels","MAC protocol","cochannel interference","performance"]}],"abstract":"In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), one essential issue is how to increase channel utilization while avoiding the hidden-terminal and the exposed-terminal problems.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of combining the concept of power control with the RTS/CTS-based and busy-tone-based protocols to further increase channel utilization. A sender will use an appropriate power level to transmit its packets so as to increase the possibility of channel reuse. The possibility of using discrete, instead of continuous, power levels is also discussed. Through analyses and simulations, we demonstrate the advantage of our new MAC protocol.

SEAMA exploits the time variations of the speech coding rate, through statistical multiplexing, to efficiently use the available bandwidth and to increase the link utilization. In each frame, SEAMA allocates bandwidth among calls as needed. Ongoing calls are always assigned some minimum bandwidth to allow for coding of the background noise during silence periods. An embedded voice encoding scheme is employed to allow the network to control the rate of the calls during congestion by selectively dropping some of the less significant packets, thus causing a graceful degradation of quality. It is shown that by employing an appropriate voice coding scheme and exploiting the characteristics of the source encoder in the MAC protocol, SEAMA almost doubles the capacity of the voice section compared to a circuit-switched network, while practically maintaining the quality of voice traffic.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEAMA: a source encoding assisted multiple access protocol for wireless communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.872956","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/18893/00872956.pdf","startPage":"1682","endPage":"1700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.872956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=872956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/872956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","displayDocTitle":"SEAMA: a source encoding assisted multiple access protocol for wireless communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6737426","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEAMA: a source encoding assisted multiple access protocol for wireless communications","sourcePdf":"00872956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047025S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","articleId":"872956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":872957,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The protocol is a free random access protocol when the traffic load is light, and switches smoothly and automatically to a reservation protocol when traffic load becomes heavier. It is based on distributed queues and a collision resolution algorithm. Moreover, a physical receiver structure is proposed and analyzed in order to preserve the robustness of the protocol in a wireless link.

At these data rates, turnaround times in half-duplex radios are a large overhead. This makes the current wireless standards inefficient. However, busy-tone solutions can get around this problem. In spite of their better performance, the busy-tone protocols are not widely used because of the hardware cost, i.e., the requirement of two transceivers-one each for the data and feedback channel. A novel wireless transceiver architecture which mitigates this hardware cost by overlaying the data channel and the feedback channel in the same frequency band is designed. It is shown that this transceiver can be built with current technology. Based on this wireless transceiver, a new MAC protocol called wireless collision detect (WCD) is proposed. This protocol uses a carrier detect signal to decrease the collision probability and receiver initiated feedback to handle hidden nodes. We derive a mathematical expression for the throughput of the protocol. The simulation results match the analysis. At 100 Mbits/s, WCD achieves 77% efficiency with 192 byte packets. For this scenario, the throughput of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol and RI-BTMA is 3% and 52%, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/18893/00872960.pdf","startPage":"1740","endPage":"1750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.872960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.872960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=872960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an access mechanism for a high speed distributed wireless LAN","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Feedback","Transceivers","Wireless LAN","Hardware","Costs","Throughput","Access protocols","Collision mitigation","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless LAN","indoor radio","transceivers","access protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access mechanism","high speed distributed wireless LAN","indoor wireless LAN","MAC protocol","data rates","wireless standards","busy-tone protocols","wireless transceiver architecture","data channel","feedback channel","wireless collision detect","carrier detect signal","collision probability","receiver initiated feedback","hidden nodes","WCD","10 to 100 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/872960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Design of an access mechanism for a high speed distributed wireless LAN","volume":"18","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6737430","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an access mechanism for a high speed distributed wireless LAN","sourcePdf":"00872960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044592S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"24","articleId":"872960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":872963,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The fraction of channel bandwidth used by successfully transmitted messages gives a good indication of the protocol efficiency, and its maximum value is referred to as protocol capacity. In a previous paper we have derived the theoretical limit of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol capacity. In addition, we showed that if a station has an exact knowledge of the network status, it is possible to tune its backoff algorithm to achieve a protocol capacity very close to its theoretical bound. Unfortunately, in a real case, a station does not have an exact knowledge of the network and load configurations (i.e., number of active stations and length of the message transmitted on the channel) but it can only estimate it. In this work we analytically study the performance of the IEEE 802.11 protocol with a dynamically tuned backoff based on the estimation of the network status. Results obtained indicate that under stationary traffic and network configurations (i.e., constant average message length and fixed number of active stations), the capacity of the enhanced protocol approaches the theoretical limits in all the configurations analyzed. In addition, by exploiting the analytical model, we investigate the protocol performance in transient conditions (i.e., when the number of active stations sharply changes).","doi":"10.1109/49.872963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/18893/00872963.pdf","startPage":"1774","endPage":"1786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.872963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE 802.11 protocol: design and performance evaluation of an adaptive backoff mechanism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=872963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/872963/","displayDocTitle":"IEEE 802.11 protocol: design and performance evaluation of an adaptive backoff mechanism","volume":"18","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6737433","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEEE 802.11 protocol: design and performance evaluation of an adaptive backoff mechanism","sourcePdf":"00872963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035987S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"355","articleId":"872963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":872989,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Its primary advantage over tile original implementation is that it is a much faster calculation, currently requiring less than 30 sec execution time per bed position for an adult thorax, thus making clinical whole-body scatter correction more practical. The new code runs on a single processor workstation CPU instead of a vector processor array, making it highly portable. It is modular and independent of any particular reconstruction code. The computed scatter contribution is now intrinsically scaled relative to the emission image and no longer requires normalization to the scatter tails in the sinogram when all activity is contained within the field of view, making it more robust against noise. The new algorithm has been verified against the original code on both phantom and human thorax studies. Initial results indicate that scatter correction may be accurately performed following, instead of prior to, either 3D reprojection or Fourier rebinning. Some evidence is presented that the single-scatter operator, when applied to an uncorrected emission image provides reasonable compensation for multiple scatter.","doi":"10.1109/23.873020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.873020","endPage":"1594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/18895/00873020.pdf","startPage":"1587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New, faster, image-based scatter correction for 3D PET","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873020/","displayDocTitle":"New, faster, image-based scatter correction for 3D PET","volume":"47","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6731056","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New, faster, image-based scatter correction for 3D PET","sourcePdf":"00873020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035066S","chronDate":"Aug.  2000","isNumber":"18895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"407","articleId":"873020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":873065,"authors":[{"name":"I.T.

This paper proposes a parameter estimation technique for fault detection on this type of motor. Simply by measuring the motor's input and output signals, its parameters can be estimated. This method is based on a mathematical model of the process. In the presented work, a square-wave motor is considered. An appropriate model is derived. To be able to implement the method also on low-cost microcontroller-based control units, only the power inverter supply voltage, DC current, and the motor's angular velocity have to be measured. The parameter estimation technique provides information about the electrical resistance and the back-EMF constant as well as about the mechanical parameters. Comparing the nominal with the computed parameters, faults can be detected. The approach might be applied to both end-of-line and online fault detection. Results for simulated data demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed procedure.

Further, the change in output and fault condition can be correlated allowing explicit fault identification. Using this technique, there is no requirement for a priori data describing machine fault conditions, the method is equally applicable to both sinusoidally and inverter-fed induction machines and is generally invariant of both the induction machine load and speed. The detection mechanisms are rigorously examined theoretically and experimentally, and it is shown that a robust and reliable induction machine condition-monitoring system has been produced.

These deviations affect torque and speed as well as stator terminal voltages and currents. The proposed fault detection technique senses the actual machine state with the help of real-time space-phasor models. The Vienna Monitoring Method compares online a voltage model output with a current model and observes the deviations in a rotor fixed reference frame. High accuracy and robustness allow the detection of a faulty rotor bar out of the switched voltage and current signals of an inverter-fed machine in an early state. The focus of this paper is the detection of a single rotor bar increase under transient speed conditions without the necessity of a clutched load. During an inverter-controlled acceleration, lasting only 200 ms, the Vienna Monitoring Method evaluates currents, voltages, and rotor position for the calculation of an indication quantity that allows for reliable detection. As only one acceleration task does not excite every rotor cage bar sufficiently, a set of acceleration and deceleration cycles has to be driven.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/18896/00873212.pdf","startPage":"1042","endPage":"1050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.873212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.873212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequences of field-oriented control for the detection of faulty rotor bars in induction machines-the Vienna Monitoring Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Bars","Voltage","Condition monitoring","Stators","Torque","Acceleration","Frequency","Induction machines","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","invertors","fault diagnosis","rotors","machine vector control","air gaps","magnetic flux","stators","computerised monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Vienna Monitoring Method","faulty rotor bars detection","field-oriented control sequences","air-gap flux pattern","stator terminal voltages","stator terminal currents","real-time space-phasor models","voltage model output","current model","rotor fixed reference frame","inverter-fed machine","single rotor bar detection","clutched load","inverter-controlled acceleration","rotor position","rotor cage bar excitation","200 ms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Sequences of field-oriented control for the detection of faulty rotor bars in induction machines-the Vienna Monitoring Method","volume":"47","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6729433","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequences of field-oriented control for the detection of faulty rotor bars in induction machines-the Vienna Monitoring Method","sourcePdf":"00873212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039649S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"74","articleId":"873212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":873213,"authors":[{"name":"T.W.S.

As traditional signal processing techniques are based on the nonparametric magnitude analysis of vibration signals, in this paper, two different state-of-the-art HOS-based methods, namely, a nonparametric phase-analysis approach and a parametric linear or nonlinear modeling approach are used for machine fault diagnostic analysis. The focus of this paper is on the application of the techniques, not on the underlying theories. Each technique is described briefly and is accompanied by an experimental discussion on how it can be applied to classify the synthetic mechanical and electrical faults of induction machines compared with their normality.

They convert almost 60% of the electricity produced in the US into other forms of energy to provide power to other equipment. In the performance of all motor systems, bearings play an important role. Many problems arising in motor operations are linked to bearing faults. In many cases, the accuracy of the instruments and devices used to monitor and control the motor system is highly dependent on the dynamic performance of the motor bearings. Thus, fault diagnosis of a motor system is inseparably related to the diagnosis of the bearing assembly. In this paper, bearing vibration frequency features are discussed for motor bearing fault diagnosis. This paper then presents an approach for motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis using neural networks and time/frequency-domain bearing vibration analysis. Vibration simulation is used to assist in the design of various motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis strategies. Both simulation and real-world testing results obtained indicate that neural networks can be effective agents in the diagnosis of various motor bearing faults through the measurement and interpretation of motor bearing vibration signatures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/18896/00873214.pdf","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.873214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.873214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-network-based motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rolling bearings","Fault diagnosis","Neural networks","Vibration measurement","Energy conversion","Instruments","Monitoring","Control systems","Assembly systems","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric motors","neural nets","fault diagnosis","machine bearings","electric machine analysis computing","frequency-domain analysis","time-domain analysis","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural-network","motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis","bearing vibration frequency","motor bearing fault diagnosis","time-domain bearing vibration analysis","vibration simulation","frequency-domain bearing vibration analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-based motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis","volume":"47","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6729435","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-based motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis","sourcePdf":"00873214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031638S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"476","articleId":"873214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":873216,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

Only a rise in some of the frequency components which already exist in the line current spectra of a healthy machine can be observed.

There is significant interest in identifying the characteristics of an oil well by using data from these sensors and neural networks for data processing. The purpose of this paper is to identify oil well parameters by measuring the terminal characteristics of the induction motor driving the pumpjack. Information about oil well properties is hidden in instantaneous power waveforms. The extraction of this information was done using neural networks. For the purpose of training neural networks, a complex model of the system, which included 25 differential equations, was developed. Successful application of neural networks was possible due to the proposed signal preprocessing which reduces thousands of measured data points into 20 scalar variables. The special input pattern transformation was used to enhance the power of the neural networks. Two training algorithms, originally developed by authors, were used in the learning process. The presented approach does not require special instrumentation and can be used on any oil well with a pump driven by an induction motor. The quality of the oil well could be monitored continuously and proper adjustments could be made. The approach may lead to significant savings in electrical energy, which is required to pump the oil.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","volume":"47","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6729440","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Oil well diagnosis by sensing terminal characteristics of the induction motor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oil well diagnosis by sensing terminal characteristics of the induction motor","sourcePdf":"00873219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060882S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"60","articleId":"873219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":873220,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.G.

Their popularity derives from a number of desirable characteristics, but a highly undesirable feature, often overlooked by the designer, is the highly nonlinear load imposed by these systems on the supply. For a single load, it is not uncommon to find more than 90% of the power extracted during the central 30/spl deg/ of the supply halfwave. When large numbers of these systems are connected to a common supply (for example, a bank may have literally hundreds of PCs in a dealing room in a single building), significant harmonic distortion can be induced in the supply and thus experienced by other loads. In this paper, we discuss a practical implementation of a waveform correcting circuit; the system stores energy in a capacitor and injects it appropriately into the local supply distribution subsystem, such that the overall load experienced by the external supply is sinusoidal. The system is physically small, and dissipates little power in its own right. It is thus suitable for installation in, for example, an office environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel-connected active filter for the reduction of supply current distortion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.873220","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/18896/00873220.pdf","startPage":"1108","endPage":"1117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.873220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"A parallel-connected active filter for the reduction of supply current distortion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6729441","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel-connected active filter for the reduction of supply current distortion","sourcePdf":"00873220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03999S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"12","articleId":"873220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":873223,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The effectiveness of the procedure is demonstrated through experimental results showing both good suppression of the saturation harmonics and true sensorless position control under high load torques.","doi":"10.1109/41.873224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/18896/00873224.pdf","startPage":"1142","endPage":"1150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.873224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppression of saturation saliency effects for the sensorless position control of induction motor drives under loaded conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873224/","displayDocTitle":"Suppression of saturation saliency effects for the sensorless position control of induction motor drives under loaded conditions","volume":"47","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6729445","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression of saturation saliency effects for the sensorless position control of induction motor drives under loaded conditions","sourcePdf":"00873224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05937S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"89","articleId":"873224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":873225,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Joo Er","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Meng Joo Er","id":"37087070396"},{"name":"Swee Hong Chin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Swee Hong Chin","id":"37087510878"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"873225","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873225","abstract":"A hybrid adaptive fuzzy controller comprises a weighted combination of a direct and an indirect adaptive fuzzy controller, with a continuously switched supervisory controller.

This bounding case is the simplest to analyze, and it introduces the methodology that is used in the remainder of the paper to analyze parallel GA with arbitrary migration rates and communication topologies. This investigation considers that migration occurs only after each population converges; then, incoming individuals are incorporated into the populations and the algorithm restarts. The models find the probability that each population converges to the correct solution after each restart, and also calculate the long-run chance of success. The accuracy of the models is verified with experiments using one additively decomposable function.","doi":"10.1109/4235.873233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/18897/00873233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4235.873233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18897","startPage":"216","endPage":"226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Markov chain models of parallel genetic algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Markov chain models of parallel genetic algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6737700","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markov chain models of parallel genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00873233.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031866S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"18897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"46","articleId":"873233","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-14"},{"_id":873235,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

GP can discover relationships and express them mathematically. GP-based techniques have an advantage over statistical methods because they are distribution-free, i.e., no prior knowledge is needed about the statistical distribution of the data. GP also automatically discovers the discriminant features for a class. GP has been applied for two-category classification. A methodology for GP-based n-class classification is developed. The problem is modeled as n two-class problems, and a genetic programming classifier expression (GPCE) is evolved as a discriminant function for each class. The GPCE is trained to recognize samples belonging to its own class and reject others. A strength of association (SA) measure is computed for each GPCE to indicate the degree to which it can recognize samples of its own class. SA is used for uniquely assigning a class to an input feature vector. Heuristic rules are used to prevent a GPCE with a higher SA from swamping one with a lower SA. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the applicability of GP for multicategory classification, and they are found to be satisfactory. We also discuss the various issues that arise in our approach to GP-based classification, such as the creation of training sets, the role of incremental learning, and the choice of function set in the evolution of GPCE, as well as conflict resolution for uniquely assigning a class.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6737702","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Application of genetic programming for multicategory pattern classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of genetic programming for multicategory pattern classification","sourcePdf":"00873235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066056S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"18897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"196","articleId":"873235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":873236,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Although it is generally agreed that wireless communications experience higher error rates than wireline, the nature of these lossy links is not fully understood. This paper describes an effort to characterize the loss behavior of the AT&T WaveLAN, a popular in-building wireless interface. Using a trace-based approach, packet loss information is recorded, analyzed, and validated. Our results indicate that WaveLAN experiences an average packet error rate of 2 to 3 percent. Further analysis reveals that these errors are not independent, making it hard to model them with a simple two-state Markov chain. We derive another model based on the distributions of the error and error-free length of the packet streams. For validation, we modulate both the error models and the traces in a simulator. Trace-driven simulations yield an average TCP throughput of about 5 percent less than simulations using our best error model.","doi":"10.1109/WSC.1996.873340","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Winter Simulation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Winter Simulation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6969/18768/00873340.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"604","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00873340.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.1996.873340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A trace-based approach for modeling wireless channel behavior","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873340/","displayDocTitle":"A trace-based approach for modeling wireless channel behavior","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A trace-based approach for modeling wireless channel behavior","confLoc":"Coronado, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00873340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029706S","chronDate":"1996","isNumber":"18768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6969","citationCount":"90","articleId":"873340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":873474,"authors":[{"name":"L.P.

It provided the greatest operating voltage and longest operating time.","doi":"10.1109/62.873474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/62/18899/00873474.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/62.873474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid power sources for Land Warrior scenario","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873474/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid power sources for Land Warrior scenario","volume":"15","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6730386","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid power sources for Land Warrior scenario","sourcePdf":"00873474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021066S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"17","articleId":"873474","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":873485,"authors":[{"name":"Lang Lin","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Lang Lin","id":"37336604800"},{"name":"L.J.

First, results are presented for convolutional and Reed-Solomon codes. It is shown that even with short constraint lengths, convolutional codes have the potential to outperform Reed-Solomon codes, provided that sufficient precision is used in the soft decoder. We then evaluate the performance of turbo codes under slow fading conditions and study the effects of varying codeword size. Increasing codeword size theoretically provides better interleaving between the two component codes. However, this advantage is less clear when the fading rate is significantly lower than the symbol rate, which is typical of the high-data-rate systems considered here. Under such conditions, the advantage of using two component convolutional codes in turbo codes is limited. A single convolutional code with a long constraint length may be a better choice.","doi":"10.1109/4234.873485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/18900/00873485.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4234.873485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of convolutional and turbo codes for OFDM with antenna diversity in high-bit-rate wireless applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873485/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of convolutional and turbo codes for OFDM with antenna diversity in high-bit-rate wireless applications","volume":"4","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6737708","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of convolutional and turbo codes for OFDM with antenna diversity in high-bit-rate wireless applications","sourcePdf":"00873485.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032805S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"17","articleId":"873485","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-04"},{"_id":873489,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Each of the available orthogonal spreading sequences of length N is assigned to one of the first N users which employ a common pseudonoise (PN) scrambling sequence. When the number of users K exceeds N, say K=N+M with M<N, the M additional users reuse M of those orthogonal spreading sequences but in combination with another PN scrambling sequence. An iterative multistage detection technique is used to cancel interference between the two sets of users when K>N. The proposed technique thus accommodates N users without any mutual interference and a number of additional users at the expense of a small signal-to-noise ratio penalty.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference cancellation","Bit rate","Time division multiple access","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Signal to noise ratio","Degradation","Frequency division multiaccess","Information processing","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","iterative methods","signal detection","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS/CDMA","orthogonal spreading sequences","iterative detection","direct-sequence code-division multiple access","pseudonoise scrambling sequence","iterative multistage detection","interference","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873489","doi":"10.1109/4234.873489","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/18900/00873489.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4234.873489","startPage":"289","endPage":"291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS/CDMA with two sets of orthogonal spreading sequences and iterative detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DS/CDMA with two sets of orthogonal spreading sequences and iterative detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","volume":"4","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6737712","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS/CDMA with two sets of orthogonal spreading sequences and iterative detection","sourcePdf":"00873489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042199S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"67","articleId":"873489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":873501,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

Based on the adaptive AR-prediction model and queueing theory, a simple congestion control scheme is proposed to provide an efficient traffic management for high-speed networks. Finally, using the actual Ethernet-LAN packet traffic data, several examples are given to demonstrate the validity of this proposed method for high-speed network traffic control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6740953","displayDocTitle":"Traffic modeling, prediction, and congestion control for high-speed networks: a fuzzy AR approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic modeling, prediction, and congestion control for high-speed networks: a fuzzy AR approach","sourcePdf":"00873574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094765S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"54","articleId":"873574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":873575,"authors":[{"name":"M.

First, fuzzy clustering is applied to obtain a compact initial rule-based model. Then this model is optimized by a real-coded GA subjected to constraints that maintain the semantic properties of the rules. We consider four examples from the literature: a synthetic nonlinear dynamic systems model, the iris data classification problem, the wine data classification problem, and the dynamic modeling of a diesel engine turbocharger.

Thus, one fundamental problem is how to improve the learning accuracy while the comprehensibility is kept. This paper focuses on this problem and proposes using a hybrid neural network (HNN) to refine the FDT. This HNN, designed according to the generated FDT and trained by an algorithm derived in this paper, results in a FDT with parameters, called weighted FDT. The weighted FDT is equivalent to a set of fuzzy production rules with local weights (LW) and global weights (GW) introduced in our previous work (1998). Moreover, the weighted FDT, in which the reasoning mechanism incorporates the trained LW and GW, significantly improves the FDTs' learning accuracy while keeping the FDT comprehensibility. The improvements are verified on several selected databases. Furthermore, a brief comparison of our method with two benchmark learning algorithms, namely, fuzzy ID3 and traditional backpropagation, is made. The synergy between FDT induction and HNN training offers new insight into the construction of hybrid intelligent systems with higher learning accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/91.873583","startPage":"601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/18902/00873583.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.873583","endPage":"614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving learning accuracy of fuzzy decision trees by hybrid neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873583/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Improving learning accuracy of fuzzy decision trees by hybrid neural networks","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6740957","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving learning accuracy of fuzzy decision trees by hybrid neural networks","sourcePdf":"00873583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058536S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"55","articleId":"873583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":873626,"authors":[{"name":"M.

CM-Builder uses robust natural language processing techniques to analyse software requirements texts written in English and build an integrated discourse model of the processed text, represented in a semantic network. This semantic network is then used to automatically construct an initial UML class model representing the object classes mentioned in the text and the relationships among them. The initial model can be directly input to a graphical CASE tool for further refinement by a human analyst. CM-Builder has been quantitatively evaluated in blind trials against a collection of unseen software requirements texts and we present the results of this evaluation, together with the evaluation methodology. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate that tools such as CM-Builder have the potential to play an important role in the software development process.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings ASE 2000.

For example, it is needed when building models of a domain or organising requirements documents. Since a lot of information is available in textual form, methods to identify important concepts from texts are potentially useful. Traditional methods for finding important concepts from texts rely on the assumption that the most frequent concepts are the most important. We present an approach that does not depend on this assumption. It makes use of two texts to find important concepts comparatively. We show that this approach is viable. It discovers concepts similar to those found by traditional approaches as well as concepts that are not frequent. Finally, we discuss the possibility of extending this work to requirements classification.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings ASE 2000.

To reduce the size of the package, microstrip interconnects may be densely packed together making the number of unknowns representing the currents large. It is a real challenge to model densely packed interconnects as we have to address both the issues of matrix fill-time and solution time in the moment method solution. We employ the fast Hankel transform (FHT) method to obtain an accurate numerical spatial-domain Green's function. This is followed by the matrix pencil (MP) method for the closed-form expression in terms of a sum of complex exponents. Taylor series expansions of these complex exponents are than incorporated into the sparse-matrix/canonical grid (SMCG) method for the analysis of densely packed microstrip interconnects. It is demonstrated that applying the FHT and MP procedure can greatly reduce the matrix fill-time while the fast SMCG method greatly reduce the matrix solution time. The efficiency of the method is further improved by implementing the algorithm on a parallel-computing platform.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2000.873727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

The GA simultaneously chooses, optimally, the material in each layer as well as its thickness.

This technique automatically places an upper bound on the total thickness of the composite as well as on the number of layers that form the composite. The GA-based combinatorial optimization technique presented offers several advantages over the existing approaches: (i) the GA provides a mechanism for global search; (ii) it succeeds in designing filters consisting of only a few layers and, therefore, almost always leads to a physically-realizable structure; (iii) it typically presents multiple options for the design rather than a single choice as offered by most other techniques; and, (iv) it is considerably simpler to implement than the gradient-based search procedures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of microwave filters using a binary coded genetic algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

Examples of application include horn and rod antennas, circular waveguide discontinuities, resonators, and particle accelerators. Two FDTD formulations for axisymmetrical problems have been proposed by Gwarek, Morawski and Mroczkowski (1993) and by Jurgens and Saewert (1995). Both operate on a 2D mesh, and account analytically for azimuthal sin(m/spl phi/)/cos(m/spl phi/) field dependence. The two approaches lead to different field update equations and in practice-to somewhat different results. Both algorithms require special treatment of on-axis components, which may cause instabilities or, as we show in this paper, ambiguous solutions. We propose an FDTD formulation for axisymmetrical problems, based on a new mesh construction scheme and a new set of system variables, which: eliminates the need for special on-axis equations; remains stable, and consistent for different axis locations on the mesh; and requires less computer operations per time step than the scheme of Jurgens. We also show that the differences between the two methods are due to different assumptions regarding local field behaviour in cylindrical coordinates, and that the choice of a better approximation is determined by circuit technology.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

Various TLM nodes have been developed with different stability conditions and dispersion characteristics. A general FDTD scheme equivalent to all the TLM nodes is developed. The scheme involves central finite-differencing of Maxwell's equations at the center of a cell and an averaging process at the boundary surfaces of the cell. The variations of the weighting coefficients in the averaging schemes result in the equivalence of the FDTD method to different TLM nodes such as the symmetrical condensed node (SCN) and symmetrical super-condensed node (SSCN). As a result, the TLM nodes is generally unified under and formerly made equivalent to a finite-different time-domain method. In other words, all the available TLM nodes can be computed in a FDTD fashion where Maxwell's equations are explicitly expressed and implementations of the modelling schemes such as the perfectly matched layer can be made very easily.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2000.873751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

For these applications, multipath effects are the common reception problems in dynamic, complex electromagnetic environments. In order to reduce signal fading caused by multipath effects, diversity techniques are therefore applied to the antenna system at the receiving site. For this reason, a modified printed strip monopole antenna having a polarization diversity with a hybrid feed system is proposed. From experimental results, it is shown that the impedance bandwidth for the proposed antenna can reach over 16% and the antenna length is only 17 mm (/spl sim/0.14/spl lambda//sub 0/, where /spl lambda//sub 0/, is the free-space wavelength). Owing to its compactness in antenna length, the proposed antenna can be integrated into a restricted area of 30 mm/spl times/50 mm as a part of a WLAN PCMCIA card.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2000.873764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18909","startPage":"282","endPage":"285 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

General definitions concerning the specific problem of testing RAM-based FPGAs are first given such as the important concept of 'AC-non-redundant fault'. Using a set of circuits implemented on a XILINX 4000E, it is shown that a classical test pattern generation performed on the circuit netlist gives a low AC-non-redundant fault coverage and it is pointed out that test pattern generation performed on a FPGA representation is required. It is then demonstrated that test pattern generation performed on the FPGA representation can be significantly accelerated by removing most of the AC-redundant faults. Finally, a technique is proposed to even more accelerate the test pattern generation process by using a reduced FPGA description.","doi":"10.1109/ETW.2000.873782","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE European Test Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE European Test Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/7017/18915/00873782.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETW.2000.873782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=873782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing the test generation problem for an application-oriented test of FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873782/","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing the test generation problem for an application-oriented test of FPGAs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 2000","accessionNumber":"6788969","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing the test generation problem for an application-oriented test of FPGAs","confLoc":"Cascais, Portugal","sourcePdf":"00873782.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056672S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7017","citationCount":"13","articleId":"873782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":873788,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As an adaptive signal representation method, the OSR means that a given signal is decomposed onto a number of optimal basis components, which are found from an overcomplete basis dictionary via some optimization algorithms, such as the matching pursuit (MP), method of frame (MOF) and basis pursuit (BP). Such ideas are actually very close to or exactly the same as solving a minimum fuel (MF) problem. The MF problem is a well-established minimum L/sub 1/-norm optimization model with linear constraints. The BP-based OSR proposed by Chen and Donoho is exactly the same model as the MF model. The work of Chen and Donoho showed that the MF model could be used as a generalized method for solving an OSR problem and it outperformed the MP and the MOF. In this paper, the neural implementation of the MF model and its applications to the OSR are presented. A new neural network, namely the minimum fuel neural network (MFNN), is constructed and its convergence in solving the MP problem is proven theoretically and validated experimentally. Compared with the implementation of the original BP, the MFNN does not double the scales of the problem and its convergence is independent of initial conditions. It is shown that the MFNN is promising for the application in the OSR's of various kinds of nonstationary signals with a high time-frequency resolution and feasibility of real-time implementation. As an extension, a two-dimensional (2-D) MF model suitable for image data compression is also proposed and its neural implementation is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/873870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6740254","volume":"47","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Minimum fuel neural networks and their applications to overcomplete signal representations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum fuel neural networks and their applications to overcomplete signal representations","sourcePdf":"00873870.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063031S","chronDate":"Aug 2000","isNumber":"18903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"14","articleId":"873870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":873880,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

We discuss the similarities between S/spl tilde/ (/spl omega/,t) and the standard S-parameter approach and describe a measurement technique. We also derive some important properties of the S/spl tilde/ (/spl omega/,t)-parameters and describe conditions under which microwave devices such as photoconductive switches can be analyzed by this technique. To demonstrate the usefulness of S/spl tilde/ (/spl omega/, t), we derive the complete transfer function of the time varying lumped-element model of a photoconductive switch.

The corresponding tool, YAML (Yet Another UML front end) provides support for modeling objects and a range of object relationships that are crucial to real-life embedded system designs. A YAML design entry can then be automatically translated into synthesizable C++ code for simulation and hardware synthesis.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th International Symposium on System Synthesis","pdfPath":"/iel5/7021/18921/00874023.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th International Symposium on System Synthesis","doi":"10.1109/ISSS.2000.874023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSS.2000.874023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18921","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=874023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"YAML: a tool for hardware design visualization and capture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Visualization","Object oriented modeling","Unified modeling language","Microelectronics","Libraries","Java","Embedded computing","Embedded system","Software tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","logic CAD","object-oriented methods","embedded systems","C++ language","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["YAML tool","hardware design visualization","system design","structural entities","functional entities","UML","Yet Another UML front end","embedded system design","C++ code","simulation","hardware synthesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/874023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","displayDocTitle":"YAML: a tool for hardware design visualization and capture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6748710","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"YAML: a tool for hardware design visualization and capture","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"00874023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054912S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7021","citationCount":"26","articleId":"874023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":874029,"authors":[{"name":"Chingren Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Comput.

Many of today's compilers for embedded processors suffer from insufficient code quality in terms of code size and performance. This violates the tight chip area and real-time constraints often imposed on embedded systems. The reason is that embedded processors typically show architectural features which are not well handled by classical compiler technology. This paper provides a survey of methods and techniques dedicated to efficient code generation for embedded processors. Emphasis is put on DSP and multimedia processors, for which better compiler technology is definitely required. In addition, some front-end aspects and recent trends in research and industry are briefly covered. The goal of these recent efforts in embedded code generation is to facilitate the step from assembly to high-level language programming of embedded systems, so as to provide higher productivity, dependability and portability of embedded software.","doi":"10.1109/ISSS.2000.874046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18921","startPage":"173","endPage":"178","pdfPath":"/iel5/7021/18921/00874046.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th International Symposium on System Synthesis","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th International Symposium on System Synthesis","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSS.2000.874046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code generation for embedded processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Embedded system","Digital signal processing","Reduced instruction set computing","Registers","Microcontrollers","Application specific processors","Hardware","Computer science","Program processors","Time factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program compilers","embedded systems","assembly language","microprogramming","software portability","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code generation","embedded processors","programmable processors","IP blocks","embedded system design","C compilers","C++ compilers","machine code","performance","chip area","real-time constraints","DSP","multimedia processors","program compiler","high-level language programming","assembly programming","software dependability","software portability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","displayDocTitle":"Code generation for embedded processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/874046/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6748733","publicationDate":"2000","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code generation for embedded processors","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"00874046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057898S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7021","citationCount":"16","articleId":"874046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":874064,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The neural network then maps the transfer characteristics of the PA, based on the amplitude modulation-amplitude modulation (AM-AM), amplitude modulation-phase modulation (AM-PM) functions. The model is used to evaluate adjacent channel power for a Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) signal.","doi":"10.1109/HFPSC.2000.874081","startPage":"45","endPage":"50","publicationTitle":"2000 High Frequency Postgraduate Student Colloquium (Cat.

The results of computer modeling of amplifying fiber Bragg gratings and the possibility of their implementation by using of consequent connected gratings as a coder in transmitter and correlator in receiver sides are shown. By applying of numerical models the performance analysis of frequency encoded FO-CDMA system is presented. Calculations are carried out for M-sequences and Walsh codes. It is shown that the choice of code sequence inside of the same family of codes, in the case of coded spectrum non uniformity, is an important factor for signal to noise ratio evaluation.

Our phase-encoded sampling technique allows high-resolution (12-bit) conversion with high linearity at practical laser power levels.","doi":"10.1109/68.874247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.874247","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1239","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/18930/00874247.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-encoded optical sampling for analog-to-digital converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Phase-encoded optical sampling for analog-to-digital converters","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6746303","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/874247/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-encoded optical sampling for analog-to-digital converters","sourcePdf":"00874247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046528S","chronDate":"Sept.  2000","isNumber":"18930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"59","articleId":"874247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":874252,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jen-Fa Huang","id":"37311438700"},{"name":"Dar-Zu Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Dar-Zu Hsu","id":"37278910300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"874252","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":267},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=874252","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Multiaccess communication","Optical receivers","Optical filters","Bragg gratings","Fiber gratings","Optical transmitters","Optical pulses","Decoding","Optical fiber LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Bragg gratings","optical fibre communication","decoding","optical receivers","optical correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fiber-grating-based optical CDMA spectral coding","nearly orthogonal M-sequence codes","optical spectral coding scheme","fiber-optic code-division multiple access communications","pseudo-orthogonality","fiber Bragg grating devices","orthogonal correlation functions","nearly orthogonal maximal-length sequence codes","receiver","defined orthogonal correlation functions","interfering users","orthogonality","FO-CDMA users"]}],"abstract":"An optical spectral coding scheme is proposed for fiber-optic code-division multiple access (FO-CDMA) communications.

The computation grid was divided among nodes. For a fixed size problem, as the number of processor increases, the speedup saturates. This happens because each processor spends less time computing but essentially the same time communicating with its neighbors. To take advantage of the parallel algorithm, the problem size must be sufficiently large compared with the number of processors. For very large problems, we can efficiently employ a large number of processors to obtain a linear speedup. In this work, the message passing interface (MPI) parallel implementation was integrated with POSIX threads using the pthreads library. This was required because each node in the cluster was equipped with two processors. On each node, each process contained two threads that executed in parallel. As expected, for sufficiently large problems the speedup was increased by almost a factor of two when using threads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD speedups obtained in distributed computing on a Linux workstation cluster","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

This unacceptable cost can be reduced to O(N/sub t/N/sub s/log/sup 2/N/sub s/) by using the multilevel plane-wave time-domain (PWTD) scheme.

Unfortunately, the PML can still suffer from late time reflections when terminating highly elongated lattices or when simulating fields with very long time signatures. This is partly due to the weakly causal nature of the PML. Alternatively, a strictly causal PML was introduced in Kuzuoglu and Mittra (1996). The resulting tensor is referred to here as the complex frequency shifted (CFS) tensor. The application of this technique within the FDTD has been presented previously. Here, the formulation is postulated for a generalized medium, including lossy, dispersive, anisotropic, or non-linear media. For such a medium, there are no additional memory requirements as compared to the standard FDTD/PML methods. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that it accurately absorbs highly oblique incident waves with long time signatures and is computationally efficient.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2000.874457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

By employing the coaxial model and the gap voltage model, we showed the coaxial model effectively reduced the amount of time steps and did not require the time window function to estimate experimental results of the input characteristics. Compared with the gap voltage model, the coaxial model gives a good estimation of the input impedance by only 3000 time steps. On the other hand, the gap voltage model and time windows required 32768 or 20000 time steps for the accurate estimation. It is concluded that the coaxial model requires only 9 % or 15 % of the time steps required for the gap voltage model. As a result, we concluded the coaxial model is effective for the FDTD analysis of the cavity-backed slot antenna. This technique is easily applicable to the evaluation of mutual coupling and beam steering performance of phased array antennas.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2000.874486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

Although there are many possible mechanisms for the penetration of fields into an aircraft it is usually the windows which admit the greatest. Consequently, it is of greatest importance to understand and be able to predict the field penetration through apertures. Contrary to initial intuitive estimations this is not an entirely trivial problem for the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. Particularly when the aperture is small relative to the size of the enclosure, the decay time of a pulsed excitation can be enormous. However, there may be some advantages to introducing an artificial loss mechanism into the problem space to accelerate the decay of the late-time fields.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2000.874488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

Among the schemes developed so far are the pseudo-spectral time-domain (PSTD) and multi-resolution time-domain (MRTD) methods. In these, transforms are required and field quantities are computed indirectly. In this paper, we show that a systematic way of developing arbitrary high-order FDTD schemes can also achieve numerical dispersion as low as that of PSTD and MRTD. The advantages of the present method are: (1) it is simple and straightforward, as the field quantities are calculated directly; and (2) it can also achieve low spatial sampling rates down to two grid points per wavelength and yet the memory requirements are similar to those for MRTD and PSTD. Numerical examples are given to validate the method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

The proposed recognition system is based on multilayer feed forward neural networks (MFNNs) and uses texture information encoded with corresponding statistical measures that are fed as input to the MFNN. Experiments were performed for recognition of different types of tumors in various images and also a number of sequentially acquired frames. The recognition of a polypoid tumor of the colon in the original image, which were used for training was very high. The trained network was also able to satisfactorily recognize the tumor in a sequence of video frames. The results of the proposed approach were very promising and it seems that it can be efficiently applied for tumor recognition.","doi":"10.1109/EURMIC.2000.874524","startPage":"423","endPage":"429 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th Euromicro Conference.

This paper shows that these drawbacks can be alleviated in a shaped double-shell dielectric lens antenna. An example of a double-material lens is discussed in terms of the radiation patterns, internal reflection losses, and frequency behaviour. Geometric optics (GO) formulation is used at the first design step, and physical optics (PO) is used to obtain the actual radiation pattern. The synthesis method has been generalised for the case where two refracting interfaces are considered. An important target for millimetre wave wireless applications is the shaped elevation pattern that ideally compensates for the free-space loss in each observation direction within a cell. This corresponds to a sec/sup 2//spl theta/ radiation pattern, and it is adopted as the target pattern in the example included. Appropriate design further allows for some control of the cell spillover.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2000.874563","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

It influences to a high degree all quality aspects of the final hardware implementation. FPGAs are commonly used for implementation of systems produced in small- to medium-size series or requiring a relatively high speed and/or (re)programmability. With both speed and logic capacity rapidly growing, FPGAs evolved very quickly to highly-flexible technology of choice for major manufacturers. Unfortunately, the progress in synthesis methods and EDA tools for FPGA implementations does not keep up with the revolutionary development of the FPGA hardware platform. The characteristic features of the technology invalidate the traditionally used criteria, heuristics and synthesis methods. The development of new FPGA-targeted (near) optimal state assignment methods is therefore of primary practical importance. In this paper we propose a new state assignment method for FPGA implementations. It consists in optimization of the information flows in the resulting circuit. This results in binary functions with compact input supports, circuit composed of reasonably independent and highly coherent parts, and minimized (long) interconnections between the parts. The proposed method produces therefore compact and fast circuits in FPGA technology. Our tool that implements the method, compared to state-of-the-art encoding tools, consistently produces high quality results.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th Euromicro Conference.

If equivalence checking fails, Design Error Diagnosis and Correction (DEDC) is performed which can locate and correct design errors fully automatically in many cases. However DEDC algorithms always have to consider the circuit as a whole and cannot be applied locally to a small sub portion of the design. Thus, the size of rectifiable circuits is often limited which is a hard restriction for applying DEDC in industrial environments. We address the problem of how to make DEDC applicable to larger circuits. We show how a small sub circuit can be safely extracted from a bigger circuit under consideration of its environment. Our extraction method surrounds the extracted component with automatically derived logic such that the rectification of the newly constructed, much smaller circuit yields the same results as rectifying the original, much bigger circuit. In addition, we compare the extraction method with the circuit abstraction method presented by D.W. Hoffmann and T. Kropf (1999).","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th Euromicro Conference.

The main problems are related to the I/O pins and logic capacity of FPGAs. The number of pins available is a critical problem, because FPGA devices have such a reduced number of them compared with their logic capacity. In addition we must reserve some of the pins to interconnect parts of the circuit placed on non-adjacent FPGAs. Most of the previous works have been adapted from other VLSI areas, and hence, they disregard the specific features of these kind of circuit. A new method for solving the partitioning and placement problem in multi-FPGA systems is presented. We use graph theory to describe the circuit, then a classical genetic algorithm (GA) is applied with a problem-specific encoding. The algorithm preserves the original structure of the circuit and by means of a fuzzy technique it evaluates the I/O-pins consumption due to direct and indirect connections between FPGAs. We have used the Partitioning93 benchmarks described with the Xilinx Netlist Format (XNF). The results obtained show how genetic algorithms are capable of accomplishing successfully the partitioning and placement tasks while respecting the board constraints.","doi":"10.1109/EURMIC.2000.874634","startPage":"204","endPage":"211 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th Euromicro Conference.

In the second part of this paper, lookup table-based multiplication (LM) is investigated. Correspondingly, the usage of different memory modules and finding the optimal combination of the memory and adders are considered. The LM architecture also considers reduction of the address width for each memory cell and the possibility of memory sub-structure sharing.

Consequently, they particularly depend on the performance of the underlying dynamic RAM (DRAM) main-memory system. Hence, two recent DRAM architectures, the widely-used synchronous DRAMs (SDRAMs) and the next-generation memory called the Direct Rambus DRAM (RDRAM), are investigated in this paper. Performance gains are revealed that can be achieved by exploiting features of recent memory interfaces with simple enhancements of current embedded memory controllers. Different approaches for memory access schemes are investigated by simulation of the DRAM architectures and the memory controller, together with an out-of-order-issue, superscalar-CPU model running various applications. The simulations lead to the following results: using RDRAMs instead of SDRAMs improves the performance of the system by up to one third, while exploiting the multibank structure of DRAMs improves the performance more than pipelining memory transfers does.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/874644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6735596","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2000","isConference":true,"volume":"1","displayDocTitle":"The impact of recent DRAM architectures on embedded systems performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of recent DRAM architectures on embedded systems performance","confLoc":"Maastricht, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00874644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054317S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7018","citationCount":"6","articleId":"874644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":874651,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A pair of precision biconical antennas was constructed to investigate this possibility. The antennas were numerically simulated in the frequency range of 30-300 MHz above an infinite conducting ground plane and in free space. The numerical results were combined with the measured S-parameters of the baluns to give the theoretical site attenuation. It has been shown that the standard site method adopted by ANSI C63.4 can have systematic errors in normalized site attenuation larger than 4 dB using free-space biconical AFs from 30 to 300 MHz.

The impact of the mutual inductance on decoupling, i.e., local versus global decoupling, was studied, using a circuit extraction approach based on a mixed-potential integral equation. Modeling indicates that local decoupling has benefits over global decoupling for certain ranges of IC/capacitor spacing and power layer thickness. Design curves for evaluating local decoupling benefits were generated, which can be used to guide surface mount technology (SMT) decoupling capacitor placement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantifying decoupling capacitor location","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility.

Several features of this absorber were found by numerical experiments using the FDTD method. There exist many answers to the dielectric constants of the absorber and patch structures for null reflectivity at a frequency. The frequency of null reflectivity largely shifts with the variation of the patch structure. A lot of measurements have also qualitatively supported these computational results which suggest that the metal patches are considered to work as capacitors like artificial dielectrics. An absorber of this kind features a versatile design and the possibility of extreme thinness.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2000.874721","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility.

The great promise of SWR is the ability to adapt to changing environments. This applies equally to the need for multiple standards compliance as well as the need to adapt to the ever-changing mobile environment. The objective of this paper is to compare various power control (PC) techniques in the framework of a third generation (3G) mobile communication system utilizing SWR technology. Firstly, an introduction is given into 3G systems, specifically the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). Secondly, different implementation architectures for SWR are described and compared on the basis of their reconfigurability. Thirdly, the performance of different PC techniques are compared and discussed in terms of their use in 3G systems. Lastly, it is shown that SWR, even in its more realistic form referred to as software defined radio (SDR), provides an excellent technology for the implementation of reconfigurable system parameters such as the PC technique required by the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A software defined radio architecture with power control for 3G W-CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE/AFCEA EUROCOMM 2000.

The technique utilizes a multiplicity of communication and processing techniques namely, concatenated short signature coding, convolutional and BCH error/erasure decoding, and pipelining to provide the minimum possible acquisition time in severe overload CDMA and carrier offsets conditions. The overall implementation is equivalent to a very long physical matched filter but is relatively immune to the Doppler degradation such long filter exhibits as will be shown by analysis results. We also propose two strategies in conjunction with the new virtual matched filtering, and compare their performance to known serial, parallel and matched filtering code acquisition techniques.","doi":"10.1109/EURCOM.2000.874775","publicationTitle":"IEEE/AFCEA EUROCOMM 2000.

Major causes of the loss, such as significant Doppler frequency offset, fast fading distortions during OFDM symbols and multipath delays have been studied. The models put up for analyzing are based on their continuous waveforms, using the summation of sine and cosine series. The results obtained give a clear picture of how and to what degree these distortions could affect the useful OFDM symbols. A stochastic model has been developed for modeling the time-varying behavior of the received OFDM signal. Different frequency and time domain coding schemes as well as combined frequency-time domain coding (two-dimensional coding) scheme have been examined. Simulation results have shown that coding in the frequency domain gives a better performance in the slow multipath fading LEO channel, while coding in the time domain is more suitable in the fast fading LEO channel. Combined frequency-time domain coding which has the same complexity as the other two schemes is not suitable for the LEO channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of frequency and time domain coded OFDM over fast fading LEO channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE/AFCEA EUROCOMM 2000.

The first step has been the development of a rather simplified method to estimate the mean and variance of the intercell interference. In order to shape this interference the Gaussian and Gamma distribution have been evaluated and the path loss and the shadowing effects have been considered. Using this interference model, an iterative method has been introduced to estimate the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems capacity. Following the results we can appreciate the capacity threshold for every class of guaranteed service and the whole capacity of the system when we integrate several types of services. We can judge by the results that, having in mind this interference model, there is a linear connection between the system capacity and the bit rates. This relation allows the dimensioning of a WCDMA system in a simple way depending on the different classes of supported traffic. Besides, this dimensioning is the initial steps for the application of resource control and call admission algorithms to the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity analysis of an integrated wideband CDMA system","publicationTitle":"IEEE/AFCEA EUROCOMM 2000.

The enhanced potential of advanced silicon technologies for integrated LNAs is investigated. Silicon (including Si/SiGe) technologies are shown to offer LNA function with noise figures of about 1 dB in the region up to about 2 GHz used for mobile communications. For frequencies around 10 GHz a 50 /spl Omega/ noise figure of 2 dB is presented with gain of >20 dB in a 0.5 /spl mu/m/80 GHz Si/SiGe bipolar technology. From these excellent results in gain and noise, it can be expected that silicon-based RF technologies will also fulfill the requirements of future systems at higher frequency bands (e.g. of WLANs at 17.2 GHz, radio links up to 23 GHz, eventually even LMDS at 28 GHz), enabling the realization of completely monolithically integrated receivers and transceivers in low-cost silicon production technologies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/AFCEA EUROCOMM 2000.

In this paper we propose a new approach to solving simultaneous image restoration problems incorporating fusion of all RSI systems by integrating these problems into one augmented inverse problem by imposing the minimum entropy (ME) image model as prior knowledge for restoration (Falkovich et al. 1989). We investigate the fine structure of a Hopfield neural network and propose a sensor fusion method that can be implemented via modification of such a network into the maximum entropy neural network (MENN) using minimum entropy regularization. It is shown that applying the proposed method, the sensor and/or method fusion tasks can be solved without principal complication of the resultant structure of the MENN independent of the number of sensor platforms or methods to be fused. The overall MENN algorithm is presented. The results are illustrated by simulation samples and compared with other high resolution image restoration techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 July 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/874875/","accessionNumber":"6831761","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sensor and method fusion in remote sensing imagery with neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor and method fusion in remote sensing imagery with neural networks","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00874875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036214S","chronDate":"16-21 July 2000","isNumber":"18936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7012","citationCount":"2","articleId":"874875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":874878,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However, not much has been written on Fourier transforming sparse spatial data where the Fourier transform is needed at only sparse data points in the Fourier space in 2D or 3D. It finds applications in remote sensing, inverse problems, and synthetic aperture radar where the scattered field is related to the Fourier transform of the scatterers. We outline an algorithm to perform this transform in NlogN operations, where N is the number of spatial data available, and we assume that the number of Fourier data desired is also of O(N). The algorithm described here is motivated by the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA), but is different from that described by Brandt (1991). In MLFMA, an embedded fast Fourier transform algorithm is inherent, where the spatial data is arbitrarily distributed, but the Fourier data is required on the Ewald sphere. In the present algorithm, the restriction of the Fourier data to an Ewald sphere is lifted so that it can be arbitrarily distributed as well. The present algorithm can be easily generalized to 3D.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Fourier transform of sparse spatial data to sparse Fourier data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

Dynamic resource scheduling is proposed as a framework that will provide QoS provisioning for multimedia traffic in W-CDMA systems. The DRS framework monitors the traffic variations and adjusts the transmission powers of users in an optimal manner to accommodate different service classes efficiently. Variable and optimal power allocation is suggested to provision error requirements and maximize capacity, while prioritized queuing is introduced to provision delay bounds. A family of DRS algorithms has been devised along these dimensions for obtaining different levels of QoS. The DRS schemes are discussed in terms of queuing and bandwidth allocation with an emphasis on their impact on delay QoS.","doi":"10.1109/35.874973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/18942/00874973.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.874973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic resource scheduling schemes for W-CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=874973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/874973/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic resource scheduling schemes for W-CDMA systems","volume":"38","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6738678","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic resource scheduling schemes for W-CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00874973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045001S","chronDate":"Oct.  2000","isNumber":"18942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"28","articleId":"874973","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":875012,"authors":[{"name":"A.F.

The different linguistic backgrounds manifest themselves as spelling and syntax anomalies. Cultural differences result in a context switch, which can substantially change the meaning of a message.

The proposed systems must provide two-way, interactive services to support aggregate data rates in the range from 1 to 20 Gbps per satellite. With the lower allocations for C- and Ku-band already congested the ITU has granted licenses to satellite organizations to operate broadband satellite systems in the Ka-band spectrum, which is often referred to as 30/20 GHz. This paper assesses the future role of satellite communications in providing mobile or fixed Internet users with broadband Internet connections. It outlines a system approach for analyzing Ka-band satellite communications link availability. It is based on GIS-generated, global rain models integrated with the link budget. The models developed allow us to examine major system design issues encountered in Ka-band (or higher) satellite communications that are susceptible to propagation impairments.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2000.875194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

An important issue is the choice of adequate basis functions. The authors show that, contrary to the common belief, those that perform best are not interpolating. By opposition to traditional interpolation, the authors call their use generalized interpolation; they involve a prefiltering step when correctly applied. The authors explain why the approximation order inherent in any basis function is important to limit interpolation artifacts. The decomposition theorem states that any basis function endowed with approximation order ran be expressed as the convolution of a B spline of the same order with another function that has none. This motivates the use of splines and spline-based functions as a tunable way to keep artifacts in check without any significant cost penalty. The authors discuss implementation and performance issues, and they provide experimental evidence to support their claims.","doi":"10.1109/42.875199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.875199","endPage":"758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/18948/00875199.pdf","startPage":"739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolation revisited [medical images application]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875199/","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation revisited [medical images application]","volume":"19","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"6750066","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"11055789","publicationDate":"July 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation revisited [medical images application]","sourcePdf":"00875199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035941S","chronDate":"July  2000","isNumber":"18948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"610","articleId":"875199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":875213,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

Due to the limitations of the conventional correlation receiver, the capacity of a single cell using CDMA is limited by self-interference and is subject to the near-far problem. To overcome these drawbacks, several advanced receiver structures have been proposed. Unlike the conventional receiver which treats multiple access interference (MAI) as if it were AWGN, multiuser receivers treat MAI as additional information to aid in detection. Although each of the multiuser types have been the subject of much literature, there is little published work comparing all structures on the basis of common assumptions. We present a comparison of five of the most discussed receiver structures: the decorrelator, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver, the multistage parallel interference cancellation receiver, the successive interference cancellation receiver, and the decorrelating decision feedback receiver. Comparisons are based on both theoretical analysis and simulation results, examining bit error rate (BER) performance in AWGN, Rayleigh fading, and near/far channels. Additionally, receiver structures are compared on the basis of computational complexity as well as robustness to code phase misalignment. Finally, we present simulation results for noncoherent architectures of the aforementioned receivers.","doi":"10.1109/25.875213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18947/00875213.pdf","startPage":"1065","endPage":"1085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.875213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simulation comparison of multiuser receivers for cellular CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","displayDocTitle":"A simulation comparison of multiuser receivers for cellular CDMA","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6751651","volume":"49","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulation comparison of multiuser receivers for cellular CDMA","sourcePdf":"00875213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064629S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"100","articleId":"875213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":875215,"authors":[{"name":"Dongwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dongwoo Kim","id":"37068059500"},{"name":"Dong Geun Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Hankuk University of Foreinn Studies, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Geun Jeong","id":"37274431000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"875215","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Narrowband","Wideband","Multiaccess communication","Power control","Interference","Mobile communication","Next generation networking","Radio network","Communication system traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","power control","telecommunication control","cellular radio","broadband networks","multimedia communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity unbalance","uplink","downlink","spectrally overlaid narrow-band CDMA mobile radio","wide-band CDMA mobile systems","mobile-to-base","base-to-mobile","code division multiple access","transmission capacity","connection capacity","power control","signal quality","spatial distribution","other-cell user interference","same-cell user interference","traffic","service applications","network evolution"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we discuss capacity unbalance between uplink (mobile-to-base) and downlink (base-to-mobile) in future code division multiple access (CDMA) radio networks where both narrow-band and wide-band CDMA systems are coexisted.

The purpose of this paper is to examine which link limits the system capacity and what are the limiting factors. To facilitate the examination, \"transmission capacity\" and \"connection capacity\" are defined, and simplified formulas are presented to compute those capacities, respectively for uplink and downlink. Signal quality required for each link, effectiveness of power control, spatial distribution of mobile users and other-cell as well as same-cell user interference are usually determining the limiting link. Besides, the traffic unbalance between the links imposed by specific service applications and the network evolution scenarios are also shown to be very influencing factors.","doi":"10.1109/25.875215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18947/00875215.pdf","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.875215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity unbalance between uplink and downlink in spectrally overlaid narrow-band and wide-band CDMA mobile systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875215/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity unbalance between uplink and downlink in spectrally overlaid narrow-band and wide-band CDMA mobile systems","volume":"49","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6751652","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity unbalance between uplink and downlink in spectrally overlaid narrow-band and wide-band CDMA mobile systems","sourcePdf":"00875215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043708S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","articleId":"875215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":875216,"authors":[{"name":"Duk Kyung Kim","affiliation":["SK Telecom Network R and D Center, Sungnam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Duk Kyung Kim","id":"38185617500"},{"name":"Dan Keun Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dan Keun Sung","id":"37276225900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"875216","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Power control","Interference","Radio propagation","Base stations","Power measurement","Call admission control","Error probability","System performance","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","power control","telecommunication control","telecommunication traffic","estimation theory","radiofrequency interference","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity estimation","SIR-based power-controlled CDMA system","ON-OFF traffic","code division multiple access","power control","signal-to-interference ratio","reverse link capacity","multiple cell environment","CBR","activity factor","E/sub b//I/sub o/","maximum received power","propagation parameters"]}],"abstract":"Capacity estimation in code division multiple access (CDMA) systems is an important issue which is closely related to power control. Many previous studies assumed strength-based power control, which maintains received power at a desired level regardless of changes in the number of active users and in the amount of total other cell interference. However, in signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based power control systems, which maintain the received SIR at a desired level, the power level is a function of the above two variables. This study derives the reverse link capacity of an SIR-based power control system supporting ON-OFF traffic in a multiple cell environment. Two different power control systems are compared in terms of capacity in both CBR and ON-OFF traffic environments.

In our scheme, the receiver antenna weights are adaptively controlled by minimizing the generated mean squared error (MSE) after RAKE combining. This results in an improvement in the average signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) for each user and is accomplished by directing beam nulls toward the interference. Transmitter antenna weights are generated by modifying the generated receiver antenna weights: RF circuitry calibration and carrier frequency calibration.

Predictions of the different configurations in line-of-sight (LOS), non-LOS (NLOS), and deep shadow areas are compared with each other and also with narrowband measurements. The analysis illustrates that although the model produces reliable results with five orders of reflection and one order of diffraction, higher orders of reflection and double diffracted rays enhance the model's performance in deep shadow areas. It is also shown that good agreement with measured results can be obtained for wall conductivity in the order of 10/sup -3/ S/m and values of relative permittivity around five. The sensitivity analysis to the antenna positioning and database inaccuracies indicates that the receiver positions which suffer the highest power deviations are those at the boundaries of the LOS areas, as well as the positions in the deep shadow regions. In general, for antenna offsets up to 1 m, the predictions of the model are not significantly affected. Finally, the building databases with 1m maximum displacement do not have severe effects on the predictions, but databases with less accuracy can seriously degrade the performance of the model.","doi":"10.1109/25.875221","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"1140","endPage":"1151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18947/00875221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.875221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation into the sensitivity of the power predictions of a microcellular ray tracing propagation model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Receiving antennas","Antenna measurements","Reflection","Diffraction","Predictive models","Ray tracing","Narrowband","Area measurement","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","electromagnetic wave reflection","electromagnetic wave diffraction","radiowave propagation","microcellular radio","sensitivity analysis","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power predictions","sensitivity","microcellular ray tracing propagation model","received power","ray permutations","wall characteristics","antenna position offsets","database inaccuracies","line-of-sight areas","nonLOS, and deep shadow areas","deep shadow areas","reflection","diffraction","double diffracted rays","relative permittivity","antenna positioning","antenna offsets","building databases"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","displayDocTitle":"Investigation into the sensitivity of the power predictions of a microcellular ray tracing propagation model","volume":"49","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6751657","publicationDate":"July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875221/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation into the sensitivity of the power predictions of a microcellular ray tracing propagation model","sourcePdf":"00875221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075043S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"52","articleId":"875221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":875222,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

The developed algorithm uses a hybrid imaging technique where the two-dimensional (2-D) image generations in vertical and horizontal planes are combined to produce 3-D paths. It also employs the concept of \"illumination zones\" of the images which greatly simplifies the image map and allows the evaluation of complex indoor scenarios. In order to investigate the accuracy of the presented model, comparisons of predictions with narrow-band and wide-band measurements are performed in line-of-sight (LOS), non-LOS (NLOS), and deep shadow areas, both for co- and cross-polarized antennas. The analysis shows that accurate power predictions can be achieved for both antenna polarizations with rms errors less than 7 dB, even when long sections of the test route are in deep shadow areas. There is a trend agreement between the simulated and measured channel impulse responses, while the rms delay spread in NLOS areas is predicted with less than 5-ns rms error (or better than 13% normalized mean error).

The essence of this functionality is complex weighting in each branch of the array and adaptive optimization of these weights. To suppress interference effectively, the weights must be continuously adjusted because deep nulls are likely to appear only in very narrow angles. This paper proposes that adaptive beamforming can be carried our in an analog manner. Three possible architectures are introduced for this purpose, and their topological schemes and electrical features of these architectures are discussed from the viewpoint of adaptive array applications. Key microwave signal processing devices and a blind weight optimization algorithm developed for analog adaptive beamforming are also described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6819607","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2000","displayDocTitle":"Microwave signal processing and devices for adaptive beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave signal processing and devices for adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00875223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026345S","chronDate":"16-21 July 2000","isNumber":"18933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7012","citationCount":"7","articleId":"875223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":875225,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed receiver is a reasonable approximation of the maximum likelihood (ML) based optimal receiver described in the present paper. A cascaded connection of an adaptive array antenna and an ML multiuser sequence estimator is the basis of the proposed receiver. The major advantages of the proposed receiver over conventional adaptive array antennas are: (1) delayed path components of desired signals can be effectively combined; (2) interference signals exceeding the degree of freedom; and (3) those having the same incident angle as that of desired path components can both be suppressed. The proposed receiver does not require prohibitively large computational complexity. Results of computer simulations presented in this paper show that the proposed receiver exhibits excellent performance even in severe multipath fading environments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.875228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18947/00875228.pdf","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1206","doi":"10.1109/25.875228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A suboptimal receiver for joint spatial-temporal filtering and multiuser detection in mobile radio communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","displayDocTitle":"A suboptimal receiver for joint spatial-temporal filtering and multiuser detection in mobile radio communications","volume":"49","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6751662","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875228/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A suboptimal receiver for joint spatial-temporal filtering and multiuser detection in mobile radio communications","sourcePdf":"00875228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029626S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","articleId":"875228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":875230,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, Red Bank, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Ye Li","id":"37350651600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"875230","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":426,"citationCountPatent":27,"totalDownloads":3754},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Parameter estimation","Statistics","Signal to noise ratio","Error analysis","Noise robustness","Dispersion","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","land mobile radio","parameter estimation","least mean squares methods","dispersive channels","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-symbol-aided channel estimation","OFDM","wireless systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","minimum mean-square error","MMSE","signal-to-noise ratios","urban channels","Doppler frequencies","hilly-terrain channels","dispersive fading channels","noise impairment","performance degradation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875230","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate pilot-symbol-aided parameter estimation for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

The blind equalizer is devised for short burst transmission formats used in many current wireless TDMA systems as well as future wireless packet data systems. Blind equalization is useful for such short burst formats, since the overhead associated with training can be significant when only a small number of bits are transmitted at a time. The proposed equalizer overcomes the common problems associated with classic blind algorithms, i.e., slow convergence and ill-convergence, which are detrimental to applying blind equalization to short burst formats. Thus, it can eliminate the overhead associated with training sequences. Also, the blind equalizer is extended to a two branch diversity combining blind equalizer. A new initialization for fractionally spaced CMA equalizers is introduced. This greatly improves the symbol timing recovery performance of fractionally spaced CMA equalizers with or without diversity, when applied to short bursts. Through simulations with quasi-static or time-varying frequency selective wireless channels, the performance of the proposed equalizer is compared to selection diversity and conventional equalizers with training sequences. The results indicate that its performance is far superior to that of selection diversity alone and comparable to the performance of equalizers with short training sequences. Thus, training overhead can be removed with no performance degradation for fast time-varying channels, and with slight performance degradation for static channels.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.875234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18947","startPage":"1235","endPage":"1247","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18947/00875234.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind equalization for short burst wireless communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Blind equalization for short burst wireless communications","publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6751666","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind equalization for short burst wireless communications","sourcePdf":"00875234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124229S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","articleId":"875234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":875240,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A ray-tracing tool based on the image method and on the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) has been developed to estimate the attenuation inside streets; loss introduced by vegetation is also accounted for. The results obtained with the application of the model to two areas of Lisbon show the importance of rays conducted by transversal streets and diffracted by vertical edges when predicting the signal near crossroads.

The propagation attenuation rates or the median signal level behaviors are found to correlate with the train carriages and frequency. On the front carriage, the propagation attenuation rate is 54 dB/100 m at 465 MHz and reduced to 21 dB/100 m at 820 MHz. However, on the rear carriage, it becomes 14.8 dB/100 m at 465 MHz and 7.8 dB/100 m at 820 MHz.

It is assumed that the initial pseudonoise (PN) code acquisition is accomplished with the aid of a conventional noncoherent PN code acquisition system, and that, upon acquiring the initial PN code epoch, the PN code tracking is performed using a channel-aided, decision-directed PN code tracking mechanism. The proposed tracking loop consists of the delayed and advanced PN correlators. The correlators are followed by data and phase correction as well as amplitude matching devices, the outputs of which are subtracted to form an error signal for code tracking purposes. The performance of the proposed tracking loop is assessed in terms of the variance of PN code tracking error and the mean-time-to-loss (MTTL) for a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel in the presence of user-induced interference. It is demonstrated that the impact of the decision-directed mechanism on the performance is to reduce the variance of timing error for moderate levels of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as compared to the conventional noncoherent delay-locked loop (NC-DLL) tracking mechanism. Also, the MTTL is shown to be highly dependent on the mobile's Doppler shift.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel-aided, decision-directed delay-locked loop for pilot symbol aided CDMA communications impaired by fast frequency-selective Rayleigh fading and user interference","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.875268","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18947/00875268.pdf","startPage":"1392","endPage":"1407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.875268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18947","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","displayDocTitle":"Channel-aided, decision-directed delay-locked loop for pilot symbol aided CDMA communications impaired by fast frequency-selective Rayleigh fading and user interference","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6751681","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel-aided, decision-directed delay-locked loop for pilot symbol aided CDMA communications impaired by fast frequency-selective Rayleigh fading and user interference","sourcePdf":"00875268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051421S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","articleId":"875268","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":875271,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In early papers, optimum transmitter power control theory has been fully investigated for cellular systems under the assumption of system-wide homogeneous signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) threshold, a minimum required SIR also known as the protection ratio. In reality, the minimum required SIR for each mobile is a function of that mobile's fading rate and other channel characteristics. Therefore it varies from mobile to mobile and can also change as a function of time as individual mobiles change their speeds. A homogeneous SIR threshold would have to be set according to the required SIR in the worst case, which would result in reduced system performance. In this paper, we explore the optimum transmitter power control theory under the assumption of heterogeneous SIR thresholds. Distributed power control algorithms are also investigated. The efficiency of these algorithms is demonstrated through simulation of CDMA cellular systems.","doi":"10.1109/25.875275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18947/00875275.pdf","startPage":"1424","endPage":"1429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.875275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum transmitter power control in cellular systems with heterogeneous SIR thresholds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875275/","displayDocTitle":"Optimum transmitter power control in cellular systems with heterogeneous SIR thresholds","volume":"49","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6751684","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum transmitter power control in cellular systems with heterogeneous SIR thresholds","sourcePdf":"00875275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027107S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","articleId":"875275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":875277,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Thus this model is not empirical nor does it require any data from the machine being modeled or any finite-element analysis results. The model is applicable to rotor positions where the stator and rotor poles overlap, and it includes iron saturation. This paper gives a detailed development of the analytical model including the approximations that are inherent to it and the justification for them. The analytical model for the flux linked by a phase is used to find the analytical equations of motion for the SRM. It is also used to obtain an analytical expression for the SRM's coenergy. Differentiating the coenergy with respect to rotor position, holding the current constant gives an analytical expression for the torque. Finally, this paper compares the analytical model's predictions to measured data from experimental machines.","doi":"10.1109/20.875277","startPage":"1996","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/18949/00875277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.875277","endPage":"2003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytically computing the flux linked by a switched reluctance motor phase when the stator and rotor poles overlap","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2000","displayDocTitle":"Analytically computing the flux linked by a switched reluctance motor phase when the stator and rotor poles overlap","volume":"36","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6758420","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytically computing the flux linked by a switched reluctance motor phase when the stator and rotor poles overlap","sourcePdf":"00875277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03182S","chronDate":"July  2000","isNumber":"18949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"100","articleId":"875277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":875282,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The main contribution of the paper is that the analysis accounts for fading of the signal of interest (SOI) as well as the cochannel interference (CCI). The paper considers BPSK signalling in flat, quasi-static channels. Rayleigh or Rice fading is assumed for the SOI, while CCI is assumed subject to Rayleigh fading. Channels associated with interference sources are assumed independent and identically distributed. Using a multivariate statistical analysis approach and assuming equal-power interference sources, analytical expressions are derived for the density function of the array output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), the outage probability, and the average probability of bit error with maximal ratio combining. Earlier results obtained for optimum combining and Rayleigh fading are extended to the case when the SOI is subject to Rice fading.

Ideally, each branch in the LINC system carries a constant amplitude signal allowing nonlinear high efficiency amplifiers to be used without generating intermodulation distortion (IMD). Misalignments in the quadrature modulators, however, introduce amplitude modulation on the branch signals and consequently IMD in the amplifiers resulting in an unwanted residual spectrum at the output. A method is presented and used to quickly estimate LINC transmitter output spectrum as a function of the misalignments without lengthy simulations for every set of parameters. Instead, spectral properties are collected once for a given modulation scheme by means of simulation and thereafter the LINC transmitter output spectrum can be calculated directly for various sets of parameters including power amplifier nonlinearities. Numerical results show that these misalignments give residual spectrum levels on a par with those caused by the mismatch between the two branches. However, misalignments in quadrature modulators are more serious since they cannot be compensated for as easily as a mismatch between the branches. In practice, the method can be used to calculate the boundaries for the misalignments from a given spectrum mask specification and, based on this, select appropriate quadrature modulators or correction techniques for reducing the misalignments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18947/00875287.pdf","startPage":"1474","endPage":"1487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.875287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.875287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18947","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral sensitivity of LINC transmitters to quadrature modulator misalignments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","Power amplifiers","Linearity","Intermodulation distortion","Amplitude modulation","Energy consumption","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Signal generators","Chirp modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intermodulation distortion","amplitude modulation","modulators","radio transmitters","spectral analysis","land mobile radio","radiofrequency amplifiers","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral sensitivity","LINC transmitters","quadrature modulator misalignments","constant amplitude signal","nonlinear high efficiency amplifiers","intermodulation distortion","amplitude modulation","branch signals","IMD","unwanted residual spectrum","spectral properties","power amplifier nonlinearities","boundaries","spectrum mask specification","correction techniques","linear amplification with nonlinear components"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","displayDocTitle":"Spectral sensitivity of LINC transmitters to quadrature modulator misalignments","volume":"49","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6751690","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral sensitivity of LINC transmitters to quadrature modulator misalignments","sourcePdf":"00875287.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063108S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"27","articleId":"875287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":875296,"authors":[{"name":"Maogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northwestern University of Evanston, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Maogang Wang","id":"37367591300"},{"name":"Xiaojian Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northwestern University of Evanston, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaojian Yang","id":"38003690200"},{"name":"M.

First, we show that a global placement with minimum wirelength has minimum total congestion. We show that minimizing wirelength may (and in general, will) create locally congested regions. We test seven different congestion minimization objectives. We also propose a post processing stage to minimize congestion. Our main contribution and results can be summarized as follows. (1) Among a variety of cost functions and methods for congestion minimization (including several currently used in industry), wirelength alone followed by a post processing congestion minimization works the best and is one of the fastest. (2) Cost functions such as a hybrid length plus congestion (commonly believed to be very effective) do not always work very well. (3) Net-centric post-processing techniques are among the best congestion alleviation approaches. (4) Congestion at the global placement level, correlates well with congestion of detailed placement.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"1140","endPage":"1148","doi":"10.1109/43.875296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.875296","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/18950/00875296.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Congestion minimization during placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Congestion minimization during placement","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6749774","volume":"19","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Congestion minimization during placement","sourcePdf":"00875296.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037318S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"36","articleId":"875296","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":875306,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We show that the test scheduling decision problem is equivalent to the m-processor open shop scheduling problem and is therefore NP-complete. However a commonly encountered instance of this problem (m=2) can be solved in polynomial time. For the general case (m>2), we present a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for optimal scheduling and apply it to a representative core-based system using an MILP solver available in the public domain. We also extend the MILP model to allow optimal test set selection from a set of alternatives. Finally, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm for handling larger systems for which the MILP model may be infeasible.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/18950/00875306.pdf","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.875306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.875306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test scheduling for core-based systems using mixed-integer linear programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System testing","Linear programming","Built-in self-test","Logic testing","Circuit testing","Optimal scheduling","Integrated circuit testing","Automatic testing","Job shop scheduling","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","computational complexity","processor scheduling","built-in self test","integrated circuit testing","application specific integrated circuits","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["core-based systems","mixed-integer linear programming","test scheduling","test resources","test buses","BIST hardware","test access architecture","start times","m-processor open shop scheduling problem","NP-complete","polynomial time","MILP model","heuristic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Test scheduling for core-based systems using mixed-integer linear programming","volume":"19","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6749776","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test scheduling for core-based systems using mixed-integer linear programming","sourcePdf":"00875306.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038111S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"137","articleId":"875306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":875317,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The macromodel is realized as a four-terminal subcircuit that emulates GMR bit behavior over a wide range of sense and word-line currents. It realistically models the nonlinear and hysteretic behavior of GMR memory bits, their transient thermal behavior, and the sense-current dependency of their write thresholds. The model is flexible and relatively simple: Ranges of the write/read currents and bit resistance values are incorporated as parameterized variables, and no semiconductor devices are used within the model.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/18949/00875339.pdf","doi":"10.1109/20.875339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.875339","startPage":"2062","endPage":"2072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal HSPICE macromodel for giant magnetoresistance memory bits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875339/","displayDocTitle":"Universal HSPICE macromodel for giant magnetoresistance memory bits","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6758430","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal HSPICE macromodel for giant magnetoresistance memory bits","sourcePdf":"00875339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048789S","chronDate":"July  2000","isNumber":"18949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"13","articleId":"875339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":875364,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The generation of multiple beams, side lobe attenuation and definite nulling are important features to reduce interference and to facilitate high-quality communication channels or to improve the accuracy of navigation data. This paper describes the design and fabrication of a compact C-band antenna with digital beamforming (DBF) as a breadboard model. It uses a 5/spl times/5 array of slot-coupled microstrip patches with RHCP that form a multilayer structure together with the networks for calibration and IQ distribution. The complete antenna was tested with different parameter settings and the measurement results demonstrate its excellent and versatile characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2000.875366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

The choice of population size and mutation rate can cause the run time of the GA to vary by several orders of magnitude. The results of this investigation show that a small population size and relatively large mutation rate is far superior to the large population sizes and low mutation rates that is used by most of the papers presented in the electromagnetics community and by the GA community at large. The results of the numerical experiments presented in this paper suggest that the best mutation rate for GAs lies between 5 and 20% while the population size should be less than 16.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 July 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6819711","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2000","isConference":true,"volume":"2","displayDocTitle":"Optimum population size and mutation rate for a simple real genetic algorithm that optimizes array factors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum population size and mutation rate for a simple real genetic algorithm that optimizes array factors","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00875398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038055S","chronDate":"16-21 July 2000","isNumber":"18933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7012","citationCount":"40","articleId":"875398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":875400,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Present HT applicators for the pelvis and abdomen operate at frequencies between 70 and 120 MHz. The interference patterns are often disturbed by hot-spots at tissue interfaces. Numerical studies have shown that these hot-spots can be better resolved when 3-D instead of 2-D phase and amplitude control is applied. However, a simple axial segmenting of antennas for obtaining a 3-D applicator results in their reduced efficiency (antenna mismatching. high normal E-field, inter-channel coupling). Thus, efforts are necessary to overcome these problems. Another important precondition for further development of deep-body HT is a noninvasive monitoring of temperature in patients under treatment using magnetic resonance (MR) methods. Therefore, an interaction-free combination of HT applicator and MR tomograph is necessary. This means reduction of cross dimensions, avoidance of metal surfaces and loops as well as an absolute ban of ferromagnetic materials. The aim of this contribution is to present, how antenna structures can be geometrically shortened without sacrificing the high performance required for the MR compatible 3-D phased array applicator for deep-body HT.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2000.875407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

Different from the truncation method previously presented by the authors, the new method does not require any symmetry considerations. Because of the basic observation that a large percentage of the power absorbed in the human head model is concentrated in the proximal ear and a limited volume of the head behind it, it was possible to gradually truncate the head model in the ear-to-ear (x) direction, back-to-front (y) direction, and bottom-to-top (z) directions. It was found that it is possible to retain just 4% of the original volume of the head model to obtain 1- and 10-g SARs within 1% accuracy at the frequency of 1900 kHz. At the frequency of 835 MHz, since the actual shape of the head in proximity of the ear region affects the radiation from the cellular telephone and its radiated power, it was necessary to retain approximately 15% of the head model to achieve 1% accuracy for the 1- and 10-g SARs. The method allowed us to complete cellular telephone simulations in less than 5 minutes at the frequency of 1900 MHz using a commonly available PC. The method can be efficiently used for SAR compliance testing of wireless devices and may also be used as an efficient tool for the design of handset antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

While propagation corner losses of 30 to 35 dB occurred that increased abruptly for the NLOS courses, it was found that the distance path loss coefficient decreased at about the same rate as the LOS course, at a rate of the distance squared (/spl alpha/=2). Allowances must be made for the presence of different topological features such as open spaces or spaces between the rows of houses in the vicinity of the base station, which would cause the distance path loss coefficient to vary as /spl alpha/ becomes small to, for example, about 0.25. The delay spread was dependent on distance, and the NLOS delay spread was found to be several times larger than that of the LOS course. The standard deviation of delay spread for the NLOS courses ranged from 80 to 200 ns, which was an order of magnitude larger than that of the LOS course. The increase in the delay spread as a function of distance for the NLOS course was several ns/m, some one order of magnitude larger than that of the LOS course. The delay profile for the LOS course conformed with the power type model, but the exponents ranging from 1.9 to 2.9 were smaller than those obtained in urban environments. It was found that the models which have been proposed in the past do not account well for the NLOS data obtained in this work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LOS and NLOS path-loss and delay characteristics at 3.35 GHz in a residential environment","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

The results of our paper are illustrated by an example of a simple manufacturing system.","doi":"10.1109/3477.875442","startPage":"653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/18946/00875442.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.875442","endPage":"660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized control of discrete event systems with specializations to local control and concurrent systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized control of discrete event systems with specializations to local control and concurrent systems","volume":"30","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6737176","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","pubMedId":"18252399","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized control of discrete event systems with specializations to local control and concurrent systems","sourcePdf":"00875442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054137S","chronDate":"Oct.  2000","isNumber":"18946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"61","articleId":"875442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":875454,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This approach has immediately gained popularity, owing to the fact that it avoids the use of canonical forms, requires the determination of only one structural parameter, and has been empirically shown to yield MIMO models with good accuracy in many cases, However, the SS approach suffers from several drawbacks: there is no well-established rule tied to this approach for determining the structural parameter, and, perhaps more important the SS parameter estimates depend on the data in a rather complicated way, which renders almost futile any attempt to analyze and optimize the performance of the estimator. In this paper, we consider a transfer function (TF) approach based on instrumental variables (IV), as an alternative to the SS approach. We use the simplest canonical TF parameterization in which the denominator is equal to a scalar polynomial times the identity matrix. The analysis and optimization of the statistical accuracy of the TF approach is straightforward. Additionally, a simple test tailored to this approach is devised for estimating the single structural parameter needed. A simulation study, in which we compare the performances of the SS and the TF approaches, shows that the latter can provide more accurate models than the former at a lower computational cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","volume":"48","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6753282","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","displayDocTitle":"MIMO system identification: state-space and subspace approximations versus transfer function and instrumental variables","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO system identification: state-space and subspace approximations versus transfer function and instrumental variables","sourcePdf":"00875466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04311S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","articleId":"875466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":875468,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

The proposed method designs filters approximating prescribed magnitude and phase responses. IIR filters of this kind can have approximately linear-phase responses in their passbands, or they can equalize magnitude and phase responses of given systems. In many cases, these filters can be implemented with less memory and with fewer computations per output sample than equivalent finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters. An important feature of the proposed method is the possibility to specify a maximum radius for the poles of the designed rational transfer function. Consequently, stability can be guaranteed, and undesired effects of implementations using fixed-point arithmetic can be alleviated by restricting the poles to keep a prescribed distance from the unit circle. This is achieved by applying Rouche's theorem in the proposed design algorithm. We motivate the use of IIR filters with an unequal number of poles and zeros outside the origin of the complex plane. In order to satisfy simultaneous specifications on magnitude and phase responses, it is advantageous to use IIR filters with only a few poles outside the origin of the z-plane and an arbitrary number of zeros. Filters of this type are a compromise between IIR filters with optimum magnitude responses and phase-approximating FIR filters. We use design examples to compare filters designed by the proposed method to those obtained by other methods. In addition, we compare the proposed general IIR filters with other popular more specialized structures such as FIR filters and cascaded systems consisting of frequency-selective IIR filters and phase-equalizing allpass filters.","doi":"10.1109/78.875468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/18952/00875468.pdf","startPage":"3109","endPage":"3121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.875468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least-squares design of IIR filters with prescribed magnitude and phase responses and a pole radius constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875468/","displayDocTitle":"Least-squares design of IIR filters with prescribed magnitude and phase responses and a pole radius constraint","volume":"48","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","accessionNumber":"6753284","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least-squares design of IIR filters with prescribed magnitude and phase responses and a pole radius constraint","sourcePdf":"00875468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033052S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"118","articleId":"875468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":875469,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"lastName":"Xiang-Gen Xia","id":"37274950700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"875469","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":231,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":2896},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp","Discrete transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Frequency","Signal processing","Wideband","Radar signal processing","Synthetic aperture radar","Radar polarimetry","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","radar imaging","discrete Fourier transforms","chirp modulation","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete chirp-Fourier transform","chirp rate estimation","discrete Fourier transform","DFT","stationary signal","multiple harmonics","wideband signals","nonstationary signals","radar signal processing","synthetic aperture rada","SAR","inverse SAR imaging","radar return signals","DCFT","multiple frequency matching","chirp-type signal","signal length","noise powers","N-point DCFT"]}],"abstract":"The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has found tremendous applications in almost all fields, mainly because it can be used to match the multiple frequencies of a stationary signal with multiple harmonics. In many applications, wideband and nonstationary signals, however, often occur. One of the typical examples of such signals is chirp-type signals that are usually encountered in radar signal processing, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and inverse SAR imaging. Due to the motion of a target, the radar return signals are usually chirps, and their chirp rates include the information about the target, such as the location and the velocity. In this paper, we study discrete chirp-Fourier transform (DCFT), which is analogous to the DFT. Besides the multiple frequency matching similar to the DFT, the DCFT can be used to match the multiple chirp rates in a chirp-type signal with multiple chirp components. We show that when the signal length N is prime, the magnitudes of all the sidelobes of the DCFT of a quadratic chirp signal are 1, whereas the magnitude of the mainlobe of the DCFT is /spl radic/N. With this result, an upper bound for the number of the detectable chirp components using the DCFT is provided in terms of signal length and signal and noise powers. We also show that the N-point DCFT performs optimally when N is a prime.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete chirp-Fourier transform and its application to chirp rate estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.875469","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/18952/00875469.pdf","startPage":"3122","endPage":"3133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.875469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875469/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","displayDocTitle":"Discrete chirp-Fourier transform and its application to chirp rate estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","accessionNumber":"6753285","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete chirp-Fourier transform and its application to chirp rate estimation","sourcePdf":"00875469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026803S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"231","articleId":"875469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":875470,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

The signal estimation step of the proposed algorithm is reminiscent of successive interference cancellation (SIC) ideas. For well-conditioned data and moderate SNR, the proposed SIC-ILS algorithm provides a better performance/complexity tradeoff than competing ILS algorithms. Coupled with blind algebraic digital signal separation methods, SIC-ILS offers a computationally inexpensive true least squares refinement option.

Note that block spreading, which is also known as chip interleaving, refers to a spreading of a data block sequence, which is obtained by dividing a data symbol sequence into consecutive blocks. For such a system, we develop a simple new receiver that completely removes the multiuser interference (MUI) without using any channel information. The MUI-free operation is obtained by the use of a shift-orthogonal set of code sequences on which this receiver is based. Within the framework of the MUI-free receiver, we further present a subspace deterministic blind single-user channel estimation algorithm. As a benchmark for the MUI-free receiver and the corresponding subspace deterministic blind single-user channel estimation algorithm, we consider the linear multiuser equalizer and the corresponding subspace deterministic blind multiuser channel estimation algorithm developed by Liu and Xu (1996) for a standard synchronous DS-CDMA system in the presence of frequency-selective fading. We show that the complexity of the MUI-free receiver using the corresponding subspace deterministic blind single-user channel estimation algorithm is much smaller than the complexity of the linear multiuser equalizer using the corresponding subspace deterministic blind multiuser channel estimation algorithm.

Compared with other related systolic designs based on direct computation or a radix-2 fast algorithm, the proposed one has the same throughput performance but involves less hardware complexity. This design is suitable for high-speed real-time applications, but it would not be easily realized in a single chip when N gets large. To balance the chip area and the processing speed, we further present a new reduced-complexity design for the DFT/IDFT computation. The alternative design is a memory-based architecture that consists of one complex multiplier, two complex adders, and some special memory units. The new design has the capability of computing one transform sample every log/sub 2/ N+1 clock cycles on average. In comparison with the first design, the second design reaches a lower throughput with less hardware complexity. As N=512, the chip area required for the memory-based design is about 5742/spl times/5222 /spl mu/m/sup 2/, and the corresponding throughput can attain a rate as high as 4M transform samples per second under 0.6 /spl mu/m CMOS technology.

The support vector machine has the advantage that a smaller number of parameters for the model can be identified in a manner that does not require the extent of prior information or heuristic assumptions that some previous techniques require. Furthermore, the optimization method of a support vector machine is quadratic programming, which is a well-studied and understood mathematical programming technique. Support vector machine simulations are carried out on nonlinear problems previously studied by other researchers using neural networks. This allows initial comparison against other techniques to determine the feasibility of using the proposed method for nonlinear detection. Results show that support vector machines perform as well as neural networks on the nonlinear problems investigated. A method is then proposed to introduce decision feedback processing to support vector machines to address the fact that intersymbol interference (ISI) data generates input vectors having temporal correlation, whereas a standard support vector machine assumes independent input vectors. Presenting the problem from the viewpoint of the pattern space illustrates the utility of a bank of support vector machines. This approach yields a nonlinear processing method that is somewhat different than the nonlinear decision feedback method whereby the linear feedback filter of the decision feedback equalizer is replaced by a Volterra filter. A simulation using a linear system shows that the proposed method performs equally to a conventional decision feedback equalizer for this problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","volume":"48","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"6753293","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Support vector machine techniques for nonlinear equalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support vector machine techniques for nonlinear equalization","sourcePdf":"00875477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075477S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"228","articleId":"875477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":875478,"authors":[{"name":"A.T.

The thermal tests are done in the no-load running of IM (one test is like an open-circuit test and the other two are like short-circuit tests). Hence these methods of testing may be carried out without expensive equipment and their power consumption does not exceed the losses, which occur under full load conditions. With the help of this thermal model the final temperature rise at the full load run according to rated losses, can be easily estimated.

It is desirable to have a simplified method of determining which islanding detection methods (IDMs) are most effective. In this paper, a previously described method for finding the nondetection zones (NDZs) of IDMs is experimentally verified. This method is used to determine the NDZs of several common IDMs. These results indicate that, of the IDMs discussed in this paper: (1) Sandia Frequency Shift (SFS) is most effective; and (2) the worst-case loads are low-power loads that are near resonance at the line frequency and have a large capacitance and small inductance (a high value of the quality factor Q).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/18951/00875495.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/60.875495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.875495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18951","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determining the relative effectiveness of islanding detection methods using phase criteria and nondetection zones","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase detection","Frequency","Switches","Voltage","Reactive power","Photovoltaic systems","Capacitance","Strontium","Solar power generation","Hazards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photovoltaic power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["islanding detection methods","phase criteria","nondetection zones","utility-interactive photovoltaic system","personnel hazards","equipment hazards","Sandia Frequency Shift","worst-case loads","near resonance low-power loads","capacitance","inductance","high quality factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","displayDocTitle":"Determining the relative effectiveness of islanding detection methods using phase criteria and nondetection zones","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6745750","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determining the relative effectiveness of islanding detection methods using phase criteria and nondetection zones","sourcePdf":"00875495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051809S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"18951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"234","articleId":"875495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":875496,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Abido","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Abido","id":"37269363000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8969"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0059"}],"articleNumber":"875496","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":171,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":850},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/power/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875496","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Power systems","Power system simulation","Simulated annealing","Design optimization","Power system stability","Computational modeling","Power system analysis computing","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","simulated annealing","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimachine power system stabilizers","simulated annealing","optimization technique","robust design","optimal parameter settings","conventional fixed-structure lead-lag PSS","simulated annealing based power system stabilizer","electromechanical modes shifting","loading conditions","s-plane","derivative-free optimization technique","eigenvalue analysis","nonlinear simulation","interarea modes","system stability enhancement"]}],"abstract":"Robust design of multimachine power system stabilizers (PSSs) using simulated annealing (SA) optimization technique is presented in this paper.

Incorporation of SA as a derivative-free optimization technique in PSS design significantly reduces the computational burden. One of the main advantages of the proposed approach is its robustness to the initial parameter settings. In addition, the quality of the optimal solution does not rely on the initial guess. The performance of the proposed SAPSS under different disturbances and loading conditions is investigated for two multimachine power systems.

The main existing state of charge algorithms have two major defects: a state of charge definition not adapted to electric vehicle applications and the nonoptimal use of static performance of the accumulator to estimate its state under dynamic stresses. In order to improve these two weaknesses, we propose a new coulometric algorithm linked to the performance of the electric vehicle and where the ampere-hours virtually discharged are obtained by applying statistical equivalence coefficients to the real current profile. The evaluation of this new algorithm on real discharges reveals a significant improvement with less than 5% errors in all cases studied.","doi":"10.1109/60.875503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/18951/00875503.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.875503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy gauge for lead-acid batteries in electric vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875503/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","displayDocTitle":"Energy gauge for lead-acid batteries in electric vehicles","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6745758","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy gauge for lead-acid batteries in electric vehicles","sourcePdf":"00875503.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058224S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"18951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"73","articleId":"875503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":875506,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Song","affiliation":["CN 5300, Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Xudong Song","id":"37614250000"},{"name":"Tihao Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","CN 5300, Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Tihao Chiang","id":"37271332900"},{"name":"Xiaobing Lee","affiliation":["CN 5300, Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaobing Lee","id":"37341991000"},{"name":"Ya-Qin Zhang","affiliation":["Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA","Microsoft Research China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ya-Qin Zhang","id":"37279958300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"875506","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":125},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","HDTV","Hardware","TV","PSNR","Bandwidth","Software standards","Software algorithms","Computer architecture","Transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","high definition television","computational complexity","data compression","video coding","code standards","search problems","Boolean algebra","image resolution","digital signal processing chips","image sequences","parallel architectures","logic partitioning","carry logic","integrated logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast binary pyramid motion estimation","MPEG2","HDTV encoding","FBPME algorithm","binary multiresolution layers","exclusive-or Boolean block matching","XOR Boolean block matching","N-scale tiling search scheme","video frame","pyramid structure","resolution decimation","integer layer","resolution layer","initial motion vector candidates","binary layers","bus bandwidth","on-chip memory requirement","hardware complexity","software MPEG-2 MP@ML encoders","Advanced Television Standard Committee high definition television encoders","hardware architecture","single-chip MPEG encoders","video sequences","digital video compression standards","H.261","H.263","MPEG4"]}],"abstract":"A novel fast binary pyramid motion estimation (FBPME) algorithm is presented in this paper. The proposed FBPME scheme is based on binary multiresolution layers, exclusive-or (XOR) Boolean block matching, and a N-scale tiling search scheme. Each video frame is converted into a pyramid structure of K-1 binary layers with resolution decimation, plus one integer layer at the lowest resolution. At the lowest resolution layer, the N-scale tiling search is performed to select initial motion vector candidates. Motion vector fields are gradually refined with the XOR Boolean block-matching criterion and the N-scale tiling search schemes in higher binary layers. FBPME performs several thousands times faster than the conventional full-search block-matching scheme at the same PSNR performance and visual quality. It also dramatically reduces the bus bandwidth and on-chip memory requirement. Moreover, hardware complexity is low due to its binary nature. Fully functional software MPEG-2 MP@ML encoders and Advanced Television Standard Committee high definition television encoders based on the FBPME algorithm have been implemented. FBPME hardware architecture has been developed and is being incorporated into single-chip MPEG encoders. A wide range of video sequences at various resolutions has been tested. The proposed algorithm is also applicable to other digital video compression standards such as H.261, H.263, and MPEG4.","doi":"10.1109/76.875506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/18953/00875506.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.875506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18953","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New fast binary pyramid motion estimation for MPEG2 and HDTV encoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New fast binary pyramid motion estimation for MPEG2 and HDTV encoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875506/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6753250","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New fast binary pyramid motion estimation for MPEG2 and HDTV encoding","sourcePdf":"00875506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04825S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"18","articleId":"875506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":875514,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Our two-layered approach utilizes the best of two worlds: it uses a highly performing wavelet-based or wavelet packet-based coding technique for lossy compression in the low bit range as a first stage. For the second (optional) stage, we extend the concept of reversible integer wavelet transforms to the more flexible class of adaptive reversible integer wavelet packet transforms which are based on the generation of a whole library of bases, from which the best representation for a given residue between the reconstructed lossy compressed image and the original image is chosen using a fast-search algorithm. We present experimental results demonstrating that our compression algorithm yields a rate-distortion performance similar or superior to the best currently published pure lossy still image-coding methods. At the same time, the lossless compression performance of our two-layered scheme is comparable to that of state-of-the-art pure lossless image-coding schemes. Compared to other combined lossy/lossless coding schemes such as the emerging JPEG-2000 still image-coding standard PSNR improvements up to 3 dB are achieved for a set of standard test images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-layered wavelet-based algorithm for efficient lossless and lossy image compression","doi":"10.1109/76.875514","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.875514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/18953/00875514.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"A two-layered wavelet-based algorithm for efficient lossless and lossy image compression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6753258","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-layered wavelet-based algorithm for efficient lossless and lossy image compression","sourcePdf":"00875514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047278S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"30","articleId":"875514","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":875529,"authors":[{"name":"O.

This work examines the crosstalk analysis of such bundles. A new model based on fractals for describing the position of wires winding throughout a bundle is presented. It allows the wires' meandering degree to be tuned simply by means of a parameter (the fractal dimension). It also allows for a statistical analysis of crosstalk because it can simulate independent different realizations of the same interconnection. An efficient multifactor prediction method known as \"Kriging\" is applied in order to describe the crosstalk as a function of the input factors (cable loads, cable height above the ground plane, etc.) of the cable model. It allows for a drastic reduction in the simulation time insofar as it predicts the crosstalk at untried combinations of the input factors from a small base of input combinations. In comparing the crosstalk simulated using the fractal model with the experimental measurements good agreement was found.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875562/","accessionNumber":"6794617","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk prediction on wire bundles by Kriging approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk prediction on wire bundles by Kriging approach","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00875562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030547S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7008","citationCount":"24","articleId":"875562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":875583,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

The protocol has CDMA laid over TDMA like frame structure which has two kinds of slots, viz., data slots and control slots. The control slot holds the information of the next frame's data slot allocation. Whenever a mobile terminal needs to transmit a message, it sends a request to the base station and enters the contention process. The scheduler at the base station takes into consideration the time of generation of a call, the bit rate requirement and the message length while reserving slots for the entire length of the message generated. Three scheduling algorithms are proposed and their performances are studied for four classes of traffic. We also model our protocol using a two-dimensional Markov chain, and for a given system load we compute the state transition probabilities and derive the average waiting time. By simulation experiments we show that our (hybrid) request-TDMA/CDMA protocol is able to effectively combine the orthogonality of both time and code division multiplexing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICON.2000.875765","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Networks 2000 (ICON 2000).

The high hardware costs incurred in real time applications can be substantially reduced by adopting a suitable reuse methodology of the neurons. In addition, neurons with high speed of operation are necessitated to realise hardware efficient real time pattern recognition for images with higher resolution. In this regard, the response time and area of a neuron becomes critical in realising VLSI efficient neural networks. In this paper, the digital architecture of a multiple valued logic neuron has been proposed to realise a neural network implementation for real-time pattern recognition purposes. The proposed neuron uses a multilevel sigmoidal function as the activation function. Flat CORDIC, a new variation of the CORDIC algorithm, has been employed to generate the complex multi-level activation function in a VLSI efficient manner. The proposed neuron operates with a 200 MHz clock and has significant hardware and latency savings when compared to conventional CORDIC based neurons.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Neural networks","Pattern recognition","Delay","Very large scale integration","Neural network hardware","Costs","Image resolution","Multivalued logic","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","pattern recognition","neural nets","multivalued logic","computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CORDIC based neuron","activation function","robust pattern recognition","complexity","neural networks","multiple valued logic neuron","neural network implementation","real-time pattern recognition","Flat CORDIC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875962","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.2000.875962","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","pdfPath":"/iel5/7032/18939/00875962.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.2000.875962","startPage":"87","endPage":"94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18939","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high speed flat CORDIC based neuron with multi-level activation function for robust pattern recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A high speed flat CORDIC based neuron with multi-level activation function for robust pattern recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2000","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6742309","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high speed flat CORDIC based neuron with multi-level activation function for robust pattern recognition","confLoc":"Padua, Italy","sourcePdf":"00875962.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061688S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7032","citationCount":"6","articleId":"875962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":875964,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It has proven to obtain the optimal decision hyperplane and is also unaware of the dimensionality of the problem. The decision function is constructed with the support vectors obtained during the learning process. Each pixel bloc in the training database is processed as an input vector, the learning process finds out between input vectors those who will construct the solution (the support vectors), the weights and the threshold of the neural network. SVM does not need a test database and the solution depends entirely on the training database. The aim of our work is to exploit the regularities of the SVM decision function in an integrated vision system. The application of our vision system is object detection and localization. We use SVM classifier as the main module of the system. In order to reduce the classification computation time we are proposing a parallel implementation on an FPGA programmed with VHDL.","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.2000.875972","startPage":"147","endPage":"151","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.2000.875972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18939","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","pdfPath":"/iel5/7032/18939/00875972.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of the SVM neural network generalization function for image processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875972/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of the SVM neural network generalization function for image processing","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6742319","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of the SVM neural network generalization function for image processing","confLoc":"Padua, Italy","sourcePdf":"00875972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029039S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7032","citationCount":"13","articleId":"875972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":875980,"authors":[{"name":"N.K.

Often, the text is printed on a repetitive background of design patterns for visual effects. For recognition purposes, the text strings need to be extracted eliminating the background. Image morphology based algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. However, image morphology operations are compute intensive. We describe the design and synthesis of a high-performance coprocessor to meet the compute load. The algorithm has been synthesized for Splash 2, an attached processor on Sun hosts. The Xilinx Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based PEs are programmed using VHDL behavioral modeling. The design can run at near-ASIC speeds of /spl ap/22 MHz clock rate with effective timing of 3 milliseconds per 128/spl times/128 image frame and 3/spl times/3 structuring element. Compared with a SPARC station 20 timings of 1.5 sees, the present implementation has a speed advantage of the order of 500 times.","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.2000.875980","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","pdfPath":"/iel5/7032/18939/00875980.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.2000.875980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18939","startPage":"217","endPage":"221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based coprocessor for text string extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=875980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based coprocessor for text string extraction","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/875980/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2000","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6735822","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based coprocessor for text string extraction","confLoc":"Padua, Italy","sourcePdf":"00875980.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045262S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7032","citationCount":"2","articleId":"875980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":875981,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The proposed circuit works in parallel with the arithmetic unit, and calculates the Equal to (EQ), Greater-than (GT), Less-than (LT), Overflow (OV), Underflow (UF), and Carry-out (C/sub out/), conditions. The proposed logic is reconfigurable, and can calculate all the conditions (mentioned above) for one 64-bit, two 32-bit, four 16-bit, or eight 8-bit signed and unsigned operands. The reconfigurability of the logic is achieved using only four control signals. Two of the control signals (Part O, Part 1) are used to partition the logic into 64, 32, 16, or 8-bit independent condition resolvers and the Sign control signal is used to control the signed/unsigned operation. The Add-Sub control signal specifies and controls the Add/Subtract operation for the condition resolution. In order to achieve high speed with reconfigurability and minimum area, new techniques are developed for calculating the conditions before the results are available. The proposed logic is designed for VLIW or Media processors, which require a high degree of reconfigurability, and high speed operation. It can also be used in MIPS family of processors for early branch condition resolution, to avoid branch stalls. Simulations of realizations in a standard digital CMOS fabrication technology show a 30% improvement in speed and a 25% savings in area using the approaches presented here.","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2000.876005","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (Cat.

This work considers the implementation of a new soft error tolerance technique based on time redundancy. Arithmetic circuits were used as test vehicle to validate the approach.

The \"Design for Testability\" paradigms were developed to permit the test plan implementation early on in the design cycle. However to succeed in this strategy, the fault simulation should be carried out in order to evaluate appropriate test patterns, fault grade and so forth. Consequently adequate fault models must be established. Due to the lack of fault models, suitable for fault simulation on opamps, we propose in this work a methodology for functional fault modeling, and a method for test pattern generation. A fault dictionary for opamps is built and a procedure for compact test vector construction is proposed. Preliminary results have shown that high level opamp requirements, such as slew-rate, common mode rejection ratio etc, can be checked by this approach with good compromise among the fault modeling problems, the analog nature of the circuit and the circuit complexity by itself:.","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2000.876044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2000.876044","startPage":"289","endPage":"294","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (Cat.

These can be characterized by a set of variables having a limited number of values with a corresponding set of operations that might be applied to these variables. Different mathematical models can be used to describe such tasks. We adopted a matrix representation, which is easier to treat in digital devices. The operations on discrete matrices are unique and cannot be efficiently performed on a general-purpose processor. Although the number of such operations grows exponentially with the number of variables, to solve a particular combinatorial problem a very small number of such operations is usually required. Hence the importance of providing for the dynamic change of operations. The paper presents an approach allowing the run-time modification of combinatorial computations via reloading the RAM-based configurable logic blocks of the FPGAs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting FPGA-based architectures and design tools for problems of reconfigurable computations","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (Cat.

In this paper we show that, by designing VLSI layouts directly for an L-layer model, the layout area for a variety of networks can be reduced by a factor of about (L/2)/sup 2/ compared to the layout area required under a 2-layer model, and the volume and maximum wire length can be reduced by a factor of about L/2, leading to considerably lower cost and/or higher performance. The proposed layouts for k-ary n-cubes, hypercubes, butterfly networks, cube-connected cycles (CCC), folded hypercubes, generalized hypercubes, k-ary n-cube cluster-c, hierarchical hypercube networks, reduced hypercubes, hierarchical swap networks, and indirect swap networks, are the best layouts reported for these networks thus far and are optimal within a small constant factor under both the Thompson model and the multilayer grid model. All of our layouts are optimally scalable in that we can allow each network node to occupy the largest possible area (e.g., o(N/L/sup 2/) for hypercubes) without increasing the leading constant of the layout area, volume, or maximum wire length.","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2000.876069","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Parallel Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7045/18965/00876069.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2000.876069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer VLSI layout for interconnection networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=876069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876069/","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer VLSI layout for interconnection networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6742386","conferenceDate":"21-24 Aug. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer VLSI layout for interconnection networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00876069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071984S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7045","citationCount":"4","articleId":"876069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":876091,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The scheduling overhead of such a scheduler is /spl ap/65 /spl mu/s with the ability to stream MPEG video to remote clients at requested rates. Moreover, placement of scheduler action 'close' to the network on the Network Interface (NI) allows tighter coupling of computation and communication, eliminating traffic from the host bus and memory subsystem, allowing increased host CPU utilization for other tasks without being affected by host-CPU loading. Architectures to build scalable media scheduling servers are explored-by distributing media schedulers and media stream producers among NIs within a server and clustering a number of such servers using commodity hardware and software.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Aug. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6742396","conferenceDate":"21-24 Aug. 2000","displayDocTitle":"A network co-processor-based approach to scalable media streaming in servers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A network co-processor-based approach to scalable media streaming in servers","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00876091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06519S","chronDate":"21-24 Aug. 2000","isNumber":"18965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7045","citationCount":"12","articleId":"876091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":876111,"authors":[{"name":"I.

We propose to use depth first search (DFS) method for routing decisions. Each node A, upon receiving the message for the first time, sorts all its neighbors according to a criteria such as their distance to destination and uses that order in DFS algorithm. It is the first localized algorithm that guarantees delivery for (connected) wireless networks modeled by arbitrary graphs, including inaccurate location information. We then propose the first localized QoS routing algorithm for wireless networks. It performs DFS routing algorithm after edges with insufficient bandwidth or insufficient connection time are deleted from the graph, and attempts to minimize hop count. This is also the first paper to apply GPS in QoS routing decisions, and to consider the connection time (estimated lifetime of a link) as a QoS criterion. The average length of measured QoS path in our experiments, obtained by DFS method, was between 1 and 1.34 times longer than the length of QoS path obtained by shortest path algorithm. The overhead is considerably reduced by applying the concept of internal nodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876111/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6742401","publicationDate":"2000","conferenceDate":"21-24 Aug. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Depth first search and location based localized routing and QoS routing in wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth first search and location based localized routing and QoS routing in wireless networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00876111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028379S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7045","citationCount":"57","articleId":"876111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":876146,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Static schemes involve very low overhead and complexity compared to dynamic schemes, but can still provide significant performance improvement over the case of no load balancing. Optimization techniques are proposed for workload allocation and job dispatching. Workload allocation is modeled as a non-linear optimization problem and solved mathematically. It is shown that allocating a disproportionately high percentage of jobs to the more powerful computers improves system performance. The proposed job dispatching algorithm is an extension of the traditional round-robin scheme. The objective is to reduce burstiness in the job arrival stream to each computer The schemes are evaluated by simulation experiments. Performance results verify their effectiveness in terms of mean response time, mean response ratio, and fairness. The Optimized Round-Robin (ORR) strategy which combines both techniques outperforms other static scheduling algorithms examined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing static job scheduling in a network of heterogeneous computers","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Parallel Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2000.876153","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7045/18965/00876153.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2000.876153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18965","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=876153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing static job scheduling in a network of heterogeneous computers","conferenceDate":"21-24 Aug. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6742422","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing static job scheduling in a network of heterogeneous computers","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00876153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048906S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7045","citationCount":"34","articleId":"876153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":876155,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

However an ideal scheduling strategy would also take into account the communication requirements of the applications and the communication bandwidth that the network can offer. In this paper, we first propose a criterion to measure the suitability of each allocation of network resources to each parallel application, according to the communication requirements. Second, we propose a scheduling technique based exclusively on this criterion that provides a near-optimal mapping of processes to processors according to the communication requirements. Evaluation results show that the use of this scheduling technique fully exploits the available network bandwidth, greatly improving network performance. Therefore, the proposed scheduling technique may be used in the design of communication-aware scheduling strategies for those situations where the communication requirements are the system performance bottleneck.","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2000.876155","startPage":"391","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Parallel Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7045/18965/00876155.pdf","endPage":"398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2000.876155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"21-24 Aug. 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876155/","displayDocTitle":"On the design of communication-aware task scheduling strategies for heterogeneous systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6742424","publicationDate":"2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of communication-aware task scheduling strategies for heterogeneous systems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00876155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040803S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7045","citationCount":"7","articleId":"876155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":876163,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Analysis results show that the coefficients located at lower indexes portion of the TDC matrix seem to be more significant than others. Hence, to represent an utterance only some TDC coefficients need to be selected to form a feature vector instead of the sequence of feature vectors. It has the advantages of simple computation and less storage space. However, our experiments show that the selection of TDC coefficients is quite sensitive to background noise. In order to solve this problem, we propose the GA-based M-TDC (modified TDC) method in this paper to improve the representativeness and robustness of the selected TDC coefficients in noisy environments. The M-TDC differs from the standard TDC by the use of filters to remove the noise components. Furthermore, in the GA-based M-TDC method, we apply the genetic algorithms (GAs) to find the robust coefficients in the M-TDC matrix. From the experiments with five noise types, we find that the GA-based M-TDC method has better recognition results than the original TDC approaching noisy environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","accessionNumber":"6753674","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"6","displayDocTitle":"GA-based noisy speech recognition using two-dimensional cepstrum","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GA-based noisy speech recognition using two-dimensional cepstrum","sourcePdf":"00876300.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0328S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"15","articleId":"876300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":876302,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Jiang","affiliation":["Dialoge Systems Research Department, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA","Department of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Hui Jiang","id":"37087309890"},{"name":"K.

The approach constrains the adapted model to be a linear combination of a small number of basis vectors obtained offline from a set of reference speakers, and thus greatly reduces the number of free parameters to be estimated from adaptation data. These \"eigenvoice\" basis vectors are orthogonal to each other and guaranteed to represent the most important components of variation between the reference speakers. Experimental results for a small-vocabulary task (letter recognition) given in the paper show that the approach yields major improvements in performance for tiny amounts of adaptation data. For instance, we obtained 16% relative improvement in error rate with one letter of supervised adaptation data, and 26% relative improvement with four letters of supervised adaptation data. After a comparison of the eigenvoice approach with other speaker adaptation algorithms, the paper concludes with a discussion of future work.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/18967/00876308.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.876308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.876308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18967","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=876308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid speaker adaptation in eigenvoice space","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Loudspeakers","Adaptation model","Vectors","Parameter estimation","Error analysis","System testing","Speech recognition","Maximum likelihood linear regression","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal component analysis","adaptive systems","speaker recognition","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rapid speaker adaptation","eigenvoice space","model-based speaker adaptation algorithm","basis vectors","reference speakers","small-vocabulary task","letter recognition","performance","error rate","principal component analysis","speaker clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","displayDocTitle":"Rapid speaker adaptation in eigenvoice space","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","accessionNumber":"6753677","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid speaker adaptation in eigenvoice space","sourcePdf":"00876308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054702S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"323","articleId":"876308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":876309,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The basic approach is to partition the environment into two regions: an interior region (containing sources that are physically present within the room enclosure), and an exterior region (containing virtual sources of reverberation). The interior region is further divided into cells, and standard source localization techniques are used to identify those cells containing the desired source as well as sources of interference (e.g., competing talkers). Beamforming weights are then found to pass the desired signal, while simultaneously minimizing a weighted combination of interior interference and exterior reverberation. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique when compared with conventional beamforming methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6753681","displayDocTitle":"Cell-based beamforming (CE-BABE) for speech acquisition with microphone arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell-based beamforming (CE-BABE) for speech acquisition with microphone arrays","sourcePdf":"00876312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042338S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"5","articleId":"876312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":876314,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Huang","affiliation":["Beckman Institute and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Jun Huang","id":"37441775400"},{"name":"Yunxin Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Yunxin Zhao","id":"37277702300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2353"}],"articleNumber":"876314","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Speech recognition","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Symmetric matrices","Discrete cosine transforms","Covariance matrix","Speech enhancement","Matrix decomposition","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Subspace constraints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","speech enhancement","speech recognition","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","discrete cosine transforms","covariance matrices","autoregressive processes","Toeplitz matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCT-based fast signal subspace technique","robust speech recognition","fast computational method","Karhunen-Loeve transform","KLT","covariance matrix","autoregressive process","eigenvalues","symmetric Toeplitz matrix","energy constrained signal subspace speech enhancement","car environment"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, a fast computational method is proposed to approximate the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) for the covariance matrix of the autoregressive process.

In this paper, the transform relations are reviewed and interpreted for the mobile radio channel. The effective scattering distribution is the vector product of the antenna pattern and the incident waves and is a scalar function of angle and delay time. The space base-band frequency correlation function transforms with the averaged power of the effective scattering distribution. If the angular power density marginal of the effective scattering distribution is known, then the transform relations can be used for configuring antennas for spatial diversity. Similarly, if the delay time marginal is known, then conditions for frequency diversity are available. The two-dimensional (2-D) transform gives a convenient route for assessing tradeoffs between combined frequency and space diversity. Using modeled distributions, solutions are given for spaced directive antennas and an example is discussed for the space-frequency tradeoff.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/18969/00876319.pdf","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.876319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.876319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=876319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spaced directive antennas for mobile communications by the Fourier transform method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directive antennas","Mobile antennas","Mobile communication","Scattering","Delay effects","Frequency diversity","Transfer functions","Land mobile radio","Propagation delay","Two dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive antennas","personal communication networks","land mobile radio","diversity reception","Fourier transforms","transfer functions","multipath channels","electromagnetic wave scattering","antenna radiation patterns","antenna theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spaced directive antennas","mobile communications","Fourier transform method","channel transfer function","scattering distribution","personal communications","multipath","transform relations","mobile radio channel","vector product","antenna pattern","incident waves","scalar function","space base-band frequency correlation function transforms","angular power density marginal","effective scattering distribution","spatial diversity","delay time marginal","frequency diversity","2D transform","space-frequency tradeoff"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 2000","displayDocTitle":"Spaced directive antennas for mobile communications by the Fourier transform method","volume":"48","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6751585","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spaced directive antennas for mobile communications by the Fourier transform method","sourcePdf":"00876319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058764S","chronDate":"Jul 2000","isNumber":"18969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","articleId":"876319","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":876325,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It rapidly became clear that superior performance could be obtained with the now familiar set-associative cache design. Because of changes in technology, the time has come to revisit the design of sector caches. Sector caches have the feature that large numbers of bytes can be controlled using relatively small numbers of tag bits, while not having to transfer very large blocks. This suggests the use of sector caches for multi-level cache designs. In such a design, the cache tags can be placed at a high level (e.g., on the processor chip) and the cache data array can be placed at a lower level (e.g., off-chip). We present a thorough analysis of the design and use of uniprocessor sector caches. We start by creating a standard workload and then through simulation derive miss ratios for a wide range of sector cache designs. Those miss ratios are transformed into design target miss ratios, which are intended to be representative of a wide range of workloads. The miss ratios are then used to estimate performance, using typical timings, for a variety of one-level and true-level cache designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sector cache design and performance","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 8th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (Cat.

In this paper, the performance and complexity of parallel interference cancellation (PIC) are investigated for a multi-carrier spread-spectrum frequency code division multiple access (MC-SS FCDMA) system. Evaluating the structure of MAI, the PIC is modified to reduce its complexity to the order of the single-user detector while keeping the bit error rate in the range of the conventional PIC value.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

Therefore, intracell MAI may be suppressed by simple linear channel equalization. Similarly, intercell interference can be suppressed by means of linear space-time filtering. We compare two different adaptive receiver algorithms in the context of one or several receive antenna elements. The first one is based on adaptive LMMSE chip estimation, whereas the other one performs simple interchip interference cancellation by adaptive chip separation. The presented receiver structures are suitable for systems with long code scrambling, such as 3rd generation wideband CDMA standard.

Although random sequences have often been used for the purpose of analysis, they cannot be practically implemented because data recovery at the receiver requires a knowledge of the sequences that have been generated in the transmitter. We present a novel spread spectrum communication system for secure transmissions of digital information. The approach is based on the unconventional self encoding principles that we have developed for the modulation and detection of spread spectrum signals. The proposed system does not use pseudo-random codes, and is unique in that traditional transmit and receive code generators based on maximal-length sequences of chaotic signals are not needed. In fact, the enhanced transmission security arises not only due to the spread-spectrum nature of the signal, but also from the stochastic nature of the unique spectrum spreading and de-spreading processes. This paper describes the self-encoded system and presents the theoretical and simulation results of the system performance in additive-white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. We discuss the application of self-encoded spread spectrum to multiple access communications.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.876463","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

The air interface will include code division multiple access (CDMA) as one of the operating modes, with direct sequence spreading based on scrambling and channelization codes. The latter are used for discriminating among different users/services, and play a fundamental role in the overall system performance. We consider the orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes for channelization, and we focus our attention on the forward link from the base station to the mobile terminal. Our aims are to describe analytically the transmitted multiplexed signal passed through a HPA (inevitable in S-UMTS), before and after the non-linear amplification, and to analyze the performance loss which derives from imperfect orthogonality induced by the non-linear device. To this end, we introduce a semi-analytic procedure based on the notion of CCPR (channelization code power ratio), and we validate it through computer simulation. The major finding in our numerical results is that due to the orthogonality loss, it is impossible to fully exploit the forward link power control dynamics, with consequent capacity loss.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-linear effects on orthogonal multiplexing for the forward link of CDMA networks","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

That is, any two members of the family have periodic crosscorrelation values which are identically zero for all values of the shift index, obviating the need for mutual synchronization. Our goal is to improve the crosscorrelation properties at the possible expense of the autocorrelation. In light of advances in technology we have permitted these sequences to be complex-valued with no uniformity constraint on the sequence element absolute values. From statistical considerations the transition from uniform to nonuniform absolute values is expected to leave the effects of noise unchanged. In principle the advantage in alleviating multiaccess interference (MAI) in SS/CDMA is clear if in fact nonlinearities will not make the technique impractical. The sensitivity to nonlinearities in the transmitter system is investigated and the technique is found to be quite robust in this perturbation. A random walk model proves successful in understanding the statistics of the sequence absolute values. The issue of the size of the family is addressed from the standpoint of the effect on the sequence noiselike quality. As witnessed by its sidelobe ratio. For example, we have found that if a 3 dB sidelobe level is acceptable, the family size may include 85 members of sequence length 1024 within the framework of asynchronous orthogonality. From this base other families are suggested and investigated, including derived phase retention sequences for matched or mismatched schemes. Comparison is made with random complex generation of arbitrary and constant amplitude sequences. The technique uncovers some constant amplitude sequences which are mutually asynchronously orthogonal and have doubly periodic autocorrelations. In the evaluation of the results we use the worst-case correlations in terms of the maxima. The results are presented in terms of the expected value of parameters such as mismatch loss, autocorrelation sidelobe ratio and a measure of orthogonality. It is therefore always possible to find sequences with improved values beyond the expected values of these parameters by performing a proper search procedure. In comparing the dovetail technique with random drawing we find that our technique succeeds in interchanging the base values of crosscorrelation and autocorrelation. Comparison is made between the various techniques and with the widely known Gold codes of similar length, known for their excellent crosscorrelation properties.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dovetail construction of families of complex-valued spreading sequences with asynchronous orthogonality for SS/CDMA","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

We evaluated three CL modes using weighting factors W/sub 1,n/=A/sub 1,u/e/sup j/spl phi/1*/ and W/sub 2,n/=A/sub 1,n/e/sup j/spl phi/2*/ that are calculated according to feedback information (FBI) bits sent via the reverse link: Mode 1=:/spl phi//sub 1,n/=0, /spl phi//sub 2,n/=(/spl plusmn//spl pi//4/spl plusmn/3/spl pi//4), A/sub 1,n/=A/sub 2,n/=/spl radic/(1/2), Mode 2:/spl phi//sub 1,n/=0, /spl phi//sub 2,n/=(0,/spl pi/), A/sub 1,n/=A/sub 2,n/=/spl radic/(1/2), Mode 3: /spl phi//sub 1,n/=/spl phi//sub 2,n/=0, (A/sub 1/,A/sub 2,n/)=((1,0),(0,1)). The laboratory experimental results clarified that the received timing difference of transmitted signals from two antennas should be smaller than approximately 1/4 chip duration in order to limit the loss of transmit power to within 0.3 dB. It was also clarified that the total required transmit power for achieving the average BER of 10/sup 3/ was increased as the fading correlation between two antennas becomes larger due to the decreased diversity effect in a slow fading environment such as when the maximum Doppler frequency f/sub D/=5 Hz. However, it was increased as the fading correlation becomes small, in a fast fading environment above approximately f/sub D/=160 Hz because the combined signal power was decreased since the phase difference of the two received signals increased due to the tracking inability of the CL control. The field experimental results showed that when FBI bit errors occur in a fast transmit power of a DPCH without antenna diversity reception at a mobile station was decreased by approximately 1-2 dB compared to the case without transmit diversity, while this improvement decreased to approximately 0.5 dB with antenna diversity reception.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

In spectrally efficient transmitter antenna, frequency and time diversity schemes the information bit stream is divided into sub-streams and each sub-stream is transmitted over a different antenna, a different frequency, or a different time slot. The present work provides a fading resistant transmission scheme where a base station uses M/sub 1/ antennas and M/sub 2/ time slots M=M/sub 1/+M/sub 2/. The selective transmitter antenna diversity (space diversity) scheme is coordinated with the new pseudo-orthonormal complex rotation matrices (time diversity) to get the highest BER performance for low and medium signal to noise ratio, characteristic of wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA).

The proposed detector's main feature lies in the utilization of PIC techniques for the adaptive antenna arrays receiver since optimum beamforming and one-shot interference cancellation are supposed to be used together. The proposed receiver is utilised at the end of up-link wireless DS/CDMA communication system in which BPSK modulation scheme is used in transmission so that asynchronous users and multipath fading phenomena are introduced. The proposed receiver basic assumption is to divide signals in reliable and unreliable ones after space-time combining. The reliable signals are directly detected and cancelled from each signal received by each sensor; afterwards processed signals are once again combined and detected in order to improve decision on unreliable signals. A suitable analytical approach is proposed in order to evaluate the error probability (P/sub e/) and optimum threshold value of the receiver under consideration. Simulation results are also presented to validate obtained analytical predictions. It is shown here that proposed receiver shows a very good performance and, thanks to inherent low complexity of cancelling techniques, allows real-time operation. The performance is expressed in terms of the bit error rate (BER), which has been derived by simulations under the assumption of a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.876473","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

The focus of the experiment is on applications where power control is not available to the receiver, which results in a severe interference environment due to the near-far problem. In applying STAP techniques to the IS-95 reverse link, we consider the use of blind adaptive techniques to compensate for the lack of pilot reference symbols. For multiuser detection we focus on the technique known as successive interference cancellation (SIC), where signals are detected one at a time, in order of signal strength, and at each stage, higher level interfering signals are estimated, reconstructed, and subtracted out. We also explore the use of adaptive MMSE channel estimation techniques in conjunction with SIC detection, where the adaptive reconstruction filter recreates both the temporal structure of the channel as well as the frequency-spread characteristics of the signal components.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.876474","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

Nevertheless, the high flexibility of CDMA makes it attractive for future broadband satellite multimedia (BSM) systems. Realistic satellite communication systems require a careful system analysis to exploit the potential of CDMA at its best. In this paper, we describe a system concept for BSM relying on a hybrid code and time division multiple access technique and show that the fundamental argument against CDMA, namely receiver complexity, can be overcome. We describe how this system concept can be translated into an efficient modem architecture. We focus on the most critical part-the digital demodulator-that must be capable to sustain a user bit rate in excess of 20 Mbit/s. The main challenges of such demodulator design lie in fast synchronisation, operation at low E/sub b//N/sub 0/, low implementation loss and the complex rate conversion and buffering requirements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

For point-to-point applications, LETI has proposed the concept of a matched filter receiver able to take into account all the propagation path signals implementing a diversity combining method. The proven interest, in different kinds of environments, of this original architecture had led to the development of a family of flexible ASICs. First this paper describes two ASICs (ICARE and VICASSO), developed in 1999. Then, special attention will be given to the implementation of an asynchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) receiver. The advanced CDMA architecture developed is based on co-channel interference cancellation (IC) schemes, which meanwhile have better performance than conventional detectors and are particularly attractive for hardware implementation. Finally, this article will focus on a synchronous CDMA receiver architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.876484","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

The performance results are also compared to that of a floating point implementation. The 4-bit, 5- bit and infinite resolution A/Ds are used in some simulation runs to compare their impact on performance. 4Viterbi decoder and a 4-bit turbo decoders are used in all the fixed point simulations.

Its performance is compared with that of the coherent RAKE receiver. The figure of merit is average output signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The proposed receiver maximizes SNR and considers all the desired user's paths unlike the standard RAKE receiver which selects a subset of them. The performance improvement is supported and quantified by numerical examples. The achieved gain is shown to be substantial in nonuniform power conditions (typical of next-generation CDMA systems) and dense multipath environments where the signals are received via many paths. The chip pulse shape is the square-root raised cosine (Sqrt-RC) pulse with 22% excess bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.876488","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

An attractive solution is the use of code division multiple access (CDMA) systems possibly combined with TDMA and FDMA. In CDMA communication systems, the MAI and ISI can be efficiently combated by applying multi-sensor linear joint detection (JD) techniques, in particular, space-time processing methods. In most cases, they are derived from a symbol-level error criterion. However, in some other cases they are obtained from a chip-level viewpoint, also known as chip sequence restoration techniques. In the present paper, a detailed analytical comparison between chip-rate and symbol-rate minimum mean square error (MMSE) block filtering is provided, taking into account also other features such as structured vs. non-structured block filter computation and chip-level vs. symbol-level training sequence.

MMSE is confirmed to significantly outperform RAKE. Depending on the target uncoded bit error rate (BER), soft hand-off operation allows at least 3.5 dB less SNR for the MMSE chip-equalizers. The RAKE receiver also may operate at much lower SNR in soft hand-off mode, but a much smaller range of target BERs is available due to the multi-user access interference (MAI) induced BER floor of the RAKE receivers at moderate to high SNR.

In nearly all cases, the solution is to give a rate of W to the highest-path-gain user in each cell and virtually nothing to the others. This approach maximizes total throughput at the expense of fairness. We then extend the notion of one-user-at-a-time by assuming all users get served on a time-sharing basis. The result is a considerable gain in fairness, with a modest loss in total throughput. The average user throughput (per timeslot) now ranges from W near the base to /spl sim/0.4 W near the cell boundaries, and the average cell throughput drops by 33%. Also, compared to rate-control-only (no power control), we show that optional power allocation considerably improves both average cell throughput and transmit power usage at the terminals.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.876497","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

We devise a method of simultaneously optimizing the power and rate at which the different terminals transmit for achieving their required quality of service (QoS). The QoS is defined to be the effective data rate which is different from the transmission rate. Optimization of power enhances battery life and optimization of data transmission rates facilitates in building cheaper and power efficient mobile systems. The joint optimization problem is formulated so that for a specified QoS, the total power transmitted by all the mobiles, and the sum of the transmitting rates of different mobiles can be minimized. The optimization problem is shown to be a non-linear and non-convex problem, but is solved to get a globally optimal solution using geometric programming. Results show that with optimized rates and powers, we can obtain better QoS than that obtained by present systems which use higher power.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.876498","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

The detector jointly estimates the channel gains, the noise variance and the transmitted symbols. It yields asymptotically to the MAP receiver (or minimum error probability on decisions) by using the Gibbs sampler, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for Bayesian computation. Its performance is compared with that of the coherent parallel interference cancellation receiver and an iterative detector based on interference suppression. It is seen that the proposed Bayesian multiuser detector offers substantial performance gain over those existing methods, especially in a highly loaded system. Being a \"soft-input soft-output\" algorithm, the Bayesian multiuser detector is particularly well suited for turbo processing in a coded system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

The best performance is found for the case of the optimum threshold but nearly as good figures can be obtained with constant false alarm rate schemes.","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

Besides its many advantages, CDMA has the disadvantage that CDMA systems are interference limited. However, this limitation can be overcome by proper multiuser detection (MUD). We propose a MUD based on recurrent neural networks (RNN). This algorithm provides a performance which is close to the optimum MUD, while keeping the computational complexity low. Furthermore, the regular structure of the algorithm facilitates a hardware (HW) implementation utilizing distributed computation. The HW platform we target at are field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). Compared to application specific integrated circuits, FPGAs allow a much faster and more flexible hardware implementation. We have implemented the algorithm with a fixed point arithmetic and investigated the minimum number of binary digits required so that the performance of the algorithm does not degrade substantially. Furthermore an efficient implementation of the tanh nonlinearity is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards an efficient hardware implementation of recurrent neural network based multiuser detection","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

Our designed array antenna is covered by a conformal arrangement of sub-array elements on an 18th surface polygon structure. The transmitter and receiver components are located inside of the 18th polygon at the backside of each sub-array element. The automatic real-time calibration circuit is mounted on each transceiver component, and it operates using the transmit CDMA signal itself as its calibration reference. This reference signal is used for the LMS (least mean square) algorithm as phase and amplitude estimator. The calibration circuit has a high accuracy and a full-bandwidth tuning capability owing to additional auto- and cross-correlation circuits, and has a small interference by the reference signal because of the subtraction of the injected reference signal at the final stage of the receiver. We theoretically investigated the operations of the calibration circuit, and experimentally confirmed that the desired radiation patterns were formed by the prototype distributed local loop configuration of the array antenna.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

Based on an explanation of searching the global minima of the quadratic function of maximum likelihood (ML) optimum multiuser detection along the gradient direction for the parallel interference cancellation (PIC) multiuser detection, we modify the gradient direction in each stage as a new direction in the Krylov subspace which is spanned by the previous search directions. Directions in the Krylov subspace partially remember the search directions of previous stages, so searches along them have larger probabilities to avoid converging to the local minima. An easy iterative method is given to determine the memory factors.

The LAS detectors monotonically increase likelihood at every search step, and thus monotonically decrease error probability, and converge to a fixed point in a finite number of steps with probability one. It is proved that the thresholds set up in the LAS detectors are necessary and sufficient for monotonic likelihood ascent for an arbitrary signature crosscorrelation matrix with probability one. Among the LAS detectors, the set of wide-sense sequential LAS (WSLAS) detectors is shown to be a set of local maximum likelihood (LML) detectors defined with neighborhood size one.

The performance of LDD is expressed in terms of the near-far resistance (NFR) defined as the reciprocal of a diagonal component of inverse cross-correlation matrix of signature vector set. For dynamic CDMA, wherein randomly time-varying signature waveforms are used, NFR is a random variable. Recently, many papers have dealt with the analysis of multiuser detectors for random signature sequences. In most cases, however, these analyses considered using some bounding techniques for asymptotic multiuser efficiency or near-far resistance. In this paper, we will directly derive an approximate PDF of the near-far resistance for an asynchronous LDD and the corresponding BER expression. For these parameters, a simple accurate expression is obtained. The approximate BER will also be verified via Monte-Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approximate analysis of asynchronous linear decorrelating detector for dynamic CDMA system","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

The receiver iterates between the 2 coding dimensions, namely the spreading codes and the FEC codes. The optimum iterative multiuser receiver uses the optimum decentralised single-user detector to generate the single-user extrinsic information for the single-user decoders. This paper suggests a sub-optimum detector using a folded trellis preselection stage for the multiuser signal detection, in order to reduce the dominating complexity of the optimum decentralised detector. Simulation results show that performance is close to optimum. The effect of the single-user decoders' extrinsic information on the signal detection stage is also investigated and it is found that extrinsic information improves performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

An HPSK (hybrid phase shift keying) modulation scheme has been proposed as the spreading technique for W-CDMA and cdma2000. HPSK is a complex spreading scheme that is designed to minimize the zero-crossing signal transition. However, there is a possibility that signal transition of HPSK go through zero. We propose a new modulation scheme for W-CDMA and cdma2000. The scheme is based on HPSK, but we modified the complex scrambling to avoid zero-crossing. We call it as modified HPSK (m-HPSK). It is shown that m-HPSK outperforms HPSK in the presence of non-linear amplification.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

Thus, other sets of orthogonal sequences, quasi-orthogonal functions (QOFs), which have low correlation with the original Walsh sequences are needed. A method of generating QOFs by multiplying each Walsh code by a vector of BPSK symbols, selected based on certain correlation criteria, was proposed by K. Yang et al. (see IEEE Trans. Info. Theory, 2000). In this paper, a method is provided for constructing vectors of QPSK symbols such that the QOFs have optimal mini-max correlation with Walsh code sets of variable length. This approach of using optimal QPSK-modulated QOFs has been adopted in IS-2000 standards.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

Most of the published research on the performance analysis of CDMA systems usually accounts for subsets of these factors. We provide an analysis that combines several of the most important factors affecting the performance of CDMA systems. In particular, new analytical expressions are developed for reverse link bit error probability (BEP) of CDMA systems. These expressions account for adverse effects such as path loss, large-scale fading (shadowing), small-scale fading (Rayleigh fading), and CCI, as well as for correcting mechanisms such as power control (compensates for path loss and shadowing), spatial diversity (mitigates against Rayleigh fading), and voice activity gating (reduces CCI).

In order to simulate a system containing multiple clocks or asynchronous circuits with accuracy, an event-driven approach is highly desirable. We have developed an event-driven framework of computer system simulation in C++, called simCore, which is mainly targeted for performance evaluation simulation of computer systems, providing concurrent execution of multiple modules and event-driven module interaction mechanisms.

We discuss the application of network activity models and application models using the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation data set. Network activity models monitor the volume of traffic in the network, while application models describe the operation of application protocols. By plotting the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves induced by the traffic activity, we quantify the effectiveness of network activity models in discriminating normal connections from attack connections generated by denial-of-service and probing attacks. It is verified that denial-of-service and probing attacks leave traces on simple network activity models, with rates of false alarm which are comparable to the false alarm rates obtained by the participants of the 1998 DARPA evaluation, in which much more complex detection schemes were utilized. For application models, we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to show that attacks using telnet connections in the DARPA data set form a population which is statistically different from the normal telnet connections. The statistics used in our study are the number of bytes from the responder and the responder-originator byte ratio.

The main limitation of MPC is, however, its online computational complexity. For discrete-time linear time-invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly the state feedback control law associated with MPC, and show that it is piecewise linear and continuous. The controller inherits all the stability and performance properties of MPC, but the online computation is reduced to a simple linear function evaluation instead of the expensive quadratic program. The new technique is expected to enlarge the scope of applicability of MPC to small-size/fast-sampling applications which cannot be covered satisfactorily with anti-windup schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 American Control Conference.

The ability to detect early warning signals in systems in the form of small changes in dynamic behavior is essential to anticipate failures. In general accurate system models are an essential part in residual based fault detection. However, in complex nonlinear systems, the development of accurate models can be very difficult, thus usually other approaches are often selected. As an alternative to the nonlinear analytical models, neural networks have shown significant potential in accurately representing nonlinear systems. In this paper we show how a system identified by a neural network, and a nonlinear observer can be used to detect changes in system dynamics. Different methods for observer design are discussed. The experimental section show the observer implemented on a thermo fluid system. Several faults are introduced, and the observer prediction is compared to actual data.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2000.876635","pdfPath":"/iel5/7046/18973/00876635.pdf","startPage":"924","endPage":"928 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 American Control Conference.

As a case study we use data taken from a nonlinear injection valve for a superheater attemperator at a power plant. One neural network is trained as a nonlinear simulation model of the process, then another network is trained to act as a combined state and parameter estimator for the process. The observer network incorporates smoothing of the parameter estimates in a form of regularization. A pole placement controller is designed which takes advantage of the sample-by-sample linearization and state estimates provided by the observer network. Simulation studies show that the nonlinear observer-based control loop performs better than a similar control loop based on a linear observer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876737/","accessionNumber":"6777981","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Simulation, state estimation and control of nonlinear superheater attemperator using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation, state estimation and control of nonlinear superheater attemperator using neural networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00876737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034606S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7046","citationCount":"2","articleId":"876737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":876739,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

These hybrid methods can be put into two groups depending on whether the output vector is also involved in the clustering process, which is called the input clustering (IC) and input-output clustering (IOC). A recent paper by Uykan et al. (1998) presents a clustering-based upper bound on the RBFN output error designed by IOC. The main contribution of this paper is to obtain a similar upper bound for the IC case which explicitly depends on the RBFN parameters. This paper also presents some different upper bounds for l/sub 1/ and l/sub 2/ norms used for the quantisation error and the output error in both IC and IOC cases.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2000.876739","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 American Control Conference.

Next we present the formulation for power control (PC) of the wireless link that enables us to obtain further energy savings when the system is active. Finally, we discuss the measurements obtained for a set of PM and PC algorithms implemented for the WLAN card on a laptop. The PM policy we developed based on our renewal model consumes three times less power as compared to the default PM policy for the WLAN card with still high performance. Power control saves additional 53% in energy at same bit error rate. With both power control and power management algorithms in place, we observe on average a factor of six in power savings.","publicationTitle":"ISLPED'00: Proceedings of the 2000 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (Cat.

These systems should reconcile a sufficient battery lifetime with reduced dimensions, low cost and versatility. The design of such systems highlights many tradeoffs between performances, lifetime, cost and power consumption. Also, special circuit and design techniques are needed to comply with the reduced supply voltage (down to 1 V). These considerations are illustrated by design examples taken from a transceiver chip realized in a standard 0.5 /spl mu/m digital CMOS process. The chip is dedicated to a distributed sensors network and is based on a direct-conversion architecture. The circuit prototype operates in the 434 MHz ISM band and consumes only 1 mW in receive mode. It achieves a -95 dBm sensitivity for a data rate of 24 kbit/s. The transmitter section is designed for 0 dBm output power under the minimum 1 V supply, with a global efficiency higher than 15%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 July 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876802/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6804842","publicationDate":"2000","conferenceDate":"26-27 July 2000","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Tradeoffs and design of an ultra low power UHF transceiver integrated in a standard digital CMOS process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tradeoffs and design of an ultra low power UHF transceiver integrated in a standard digital CMOS process","confLoc":"Rapallo, Italy","sourcePdf":"00876802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04786S","chronDate":"26-27 July 2000","isNumber":"18978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7051","citationCount":"4","articleId":"876802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":876804,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In a class AB amplifier, the average current drawn from the supply depends on the input signal level. As the output power increases so does the average currents in both the emitter and the base of the power transistor. The increased average current causes an increased voltage drop in the biasing circuitry and the ballast resistor. This reduces the conduction angle in the amplifier, pushing it deep into class B and even class C operation, reducing the maximum output power by 25%. To avoid the power reduction, the amplifier should have a larger bias which inevitably has a larger power dissipation at low output power levels. The proposed bias boosting circuitry dynamically increases the bias of the power transistor as the output power increases. The amplifier has less power dissipation at low power levels with an increased maximum output power.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Power generation","Power transistors","Power dissipation","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Voltage","Electronic ballasts","Resistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bias boosting technique","class AB RF amplifier","BiCMOS process","biasing circuitry voltage drop","ballast resistor voltage drop","amplifier conduction angle","power reduction","power transistor bias","maximum output power","1.9 GHz","30 GHz","3.2 V","2 W"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LPE.2000.155300","publicationTitle":"ISLPED'00: Proceedings of the 2000 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (Cat.

Though largely built on the experience of previous studies the CNN computational framework is considerably simplified: first order RC cells are used with space-invariant nearest neighbor interactions only. All nonlinear synaptic connections are monotonic continuous functions of the pre-synaptic voltage. Time delays in the interactions are continuous represented by additional first order cells. The modeling approach is neuromorphic in its spirit relying on both morphological and pharmacological information. However, the primary motivation lies in fitting the spatio-temporal output of the model to the data recorded from biological cells (tiger salamander). In order to meet a low complexity (VLSI) implementation framework some structural simplifications have been made and large neighborhood interaction (neurons with large processes), furthermore the inter-layer signal propagation are modeled through diffusion and wave phenomena. This work presents novel CNN models for the outer and some partial models for the inner (light adopted) retina.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2000.876812","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 6th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA 2000) (Cat.

They are analogic algorithms based on simple CNN instructions considering their implementability in analogic VLSI chips. Motion information extraction from video series is very power consuming. Most computing effort is devoted to motion vector field estimation, object definition and boundary determination. Finding interrelations among small segments, obtained by oversegmentation, involves optimization through merging or separation. In our algorithm the process starts from an oversegmented image, then the segments are merged using information from spatial and temporal auxiliary data: motion fields and motion history. This grouping process is based on neighboring segment similarity in color, speed and time-depth. There is also a feedback to accept or refuse the cancellation of a segment-border. Our parallel approach is independent of the number of segments or objects. We use simple VLSI functions. We develop grouping by stochastic optimization. This relaxation-based motion segmentation can be a basic step of the effective coding of image-series and other automatic motion tracking systems. The proposed system is planned to implement in a cellular nonlinear network chip-set architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion segmentation and tracking optimization with edge relaxation in the cellular nonlinear network architecture","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 6th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA 2000) (Cat.

In this review article, the systems aspects and the new directions in this field are considered. A new world of software and a new notion of computing are taking ground. The possibility of software in optical computing becomes feasible. Likewise, programming on atomic and molecular scale implementations may be possible. Hence, photons and molecules may be used for signal representation in these analogic computers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/876823/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6755222","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 May 2000","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analogic computing: system aspects of analogic CNN sensor computers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analogic computing: system aspects of analogic CNN sensor computers","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"00876823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033797S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7052","citationCount":"1","articleId":"876823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":876824,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The orthogonality has disadvantage that the selected filter is not necessarily optimal from a viewpoint of human retinal realization. It is not necessary to select an orthogonal template in cellular neural network (CNN) image processing, because the CNN is nonlinear analog circuit to obtain equilibrium points automatically and simultaneously. This paper describes CNN image compression and reconstruction based on a nonorthogonal WT. This system have an advantage of nondependency of image scanning by spatio-temporal CNN dynamics. It is very important that the reconstruction of transmitted compression image is done simultaneously by parallel neurons based on the \"regularization\" of ill-posed problem which is caused in a retinal system of a human brain.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2000.876825","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 6th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA 2000) (Cat.

In practical applications the determination of this inverse is necessary to fulfil deconvolution tasks. The proposed method is much faster than the previously applied algorithms (like genetic algorithm) and still, in almost all practically important cases, it is convergent. Moreover, unlike a closed form method, it leads to 3/spl times/3 templates instead of 5/spl times/5 or bigger ones. In several important practical cases the PSF, which can be caused by motion, out of focus or the aberration of the imaging system, can be computed from object positions and from the optical system's parameters. Iterative deconvolution algorithms, which are necessary for volume reconstruction from microscopic image sequences, require considerable computation time. Using CNN-UM chips for these deconvolution tasks, a much higher speed, even real time processing seems to be achievable.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2000.876830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.2000.876830","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 6th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA 2000) (Cat.

It requires a three-dimensional effective environment sensing in real time. Among the others, the stereo vision approach to environmental information extraction seems to be very appealing, even if it leads an extremely high computational cost. However, a high performance implementation of this algorithm on a cellular neural network is able to overcome these difficulties. In the paper, the design of a CNN chip well suited for this algorithm is presented. This chip, performing a real time processing of the stereo vision data, will improve the cruising speed of a robotic platform.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 6th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA 2000) (Cat.

As some interesting solutions have been incorporated in the simulator design, this paper focuses on some aspects of implementation of the simulator. Furthermore, several points where further optimisation of processes is possible at low cost have been discovered.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2000.876858","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 6th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA 2000) (Cat.

In the implemented CMOS CNN, the BJT-based combined four-quadrant multiplier and two-quadrant divider with separated magnitude and sign is used to implement the Hebbien learning function and the ratio memory. Thus, the combined multiplier and divider and the CNN have simple structure and large input/output signal range. The pattern learning and recognition function of the 9/spl times/9 CNN with RM is simulated by both Matlab software and HSPICE. It has been verified that the CNN with RM has the advantages of more stored patterns for processing and longer memory time with feature enhancement as compared to the CNN without RM. Thus, the proposed CNN with RM has great potential in the applications of neural associate memory for image processing.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2000.876862","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 6th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA 2000) (Cat.

Previous demonstrations of extremely high power density and total RF power from GaN/AlGaN HEMTs on SI SiC substrates (Sheppard et al., 1999; Wu et al., 1999) adequately demonstrate their potential for improved performance over GaAs-based devices. Considering the recent advances in III-nitride growth and processing techniques, it is not surprising that GaN/AlGaN HEMTs on SiC substrates are beginning to the reach the extremely high power levels that have been predicted for this material system. To continue this trend, we are pursuing high quality HEMT structures with 15% AlGaN molar fraction (MF) in order to fabricate large area devices and demonstrate high power levels. We report the demonstration of over 40 W from a single GaN/AlGaN transistor at 10 GHz under pulsed mode conditions. This high power demonstration includes the first implementation of SiC substrate vias on a GaN-on-SiC microwave transistor for improved gain at X-band.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HEMTs","Gallium nitride","Aluminum gallium nitride","Silicon carbide","Radio frequency","Microwave transistors","K-band","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Microwave devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide band gap semiconductors","power HEMT","microwave field effect transistors","microwave power amplifiers","aluminium compounds","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","hybrid integrated circuits","microwave integrated circuits","HEMT integrated circuits","integrated circuit measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GaN-AlGaN HEMT hybrid amplifiers","GaN/AlGaN-on-SiC HEMT","RF power device","K-band power amplifiers","X-band power amplifiers","power density","total RF power","GaN/AlGaN HEMTs","SI SiC substrates","III-nitride growth","HEMT structures","AlGaN molar fraction","large area devices","power levels","GaN/AlGaN transistor","pulsed mode conditions","SiC substrate vias","GaN-on-SiC microwave transistor","X-band gain","40 W","10 GHz","5.2 to 10.9 GHz","10.9 to 36 GHz","GaN-AlGaN-SiC","SiC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DRC.2000.877078","publicationTitle":"58th DRC.

InAlAs-InGaAs HEMTs grown on InP substrates promise excellent gain and noise performance for amplifier applications well into the deep sub-millimeter wave region. Low noise amplifiers (LNAs) with 6 dB noise figure at 170 GHz (Lai et al, 1998) and 15 dB gain at 215 GHz (Weinreb et al, 1999) have been realized using TRW's sub-0.1 /spl mu/m InP HEMT MMIC technology. On the other hand, there has been controversy over the suitability of InAlAs-InGaAs HEMTs for high power amplifier (PA) applications due to the low impact ionization onset field in the InGaAs channel. Our systematic approach in enhancing InP HEMT power performance has enabled the demonstration of world-record solid-state power amplifiers at V-and W-bands (Chen et al, 1998 and 1999). The results not only set a new milestone for InP HEMT technology, but also changed perceptions on the suitability of InAlAs-InGaAs HEMTs for high power applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indium phosphide","HEMTs","High power amplifiers","Frequency","Noise figure","Performance gain","Low-noise amplifiers","MMICs","Impact ionization","Indium gallium arsenide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave field effect transistors","microwave field effect transistors","HEMT integrated circuits","MMIC power amplifiers","millimetre wave power amplifiers","impact ionisation","gallium arsenide","indium compounds","aluminium compounds","III-V semiconductors","integrated circuit noise","integrated circuit measurement","power HEMT"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high power InP HEMT amplifiers","high frequency applications","InAlAs-InGaAs HEMTs","InP substrates","noise performance","gain performance","amplifier applications","deep sub-millimeter wave region","low noise amplifiers","LNAs","noise figure","InP HEMT MMIC technology","power amplifier","impact ionization onset field","InGaAs channel","InP HEMT power performance","V-band solid-state power amplifiers","W-band solid-state power amplifiers","InP HEMT technology","6 dB","170 GHz","15 dB","215 GHz","46 to 56 GHz","56 to 100 GHz","InAlAs-InGaAs-InP","InP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DRC.2000.877122","publicationTitle":"58th DRC.

The FNTF algorithm approximates the Kalman gain by replacing the sample covariance matrix inverse by a banded matrix of total bandwidth 2M+1 (AR(M) assumption for the input signal). In this algorithm, the approximate Kalman gain can still be computed using an exact recursion that involves the prediction parts of two fast transversal filter (FTF) algorithms of order M. We introduce the subsampled updating (SU) approach in which the FNTF filter weights and the Kalman gain are provided at a subsampled rate, say every L samples. Because of its low computational complexity, the prediction part of the FNTF algorithm is kept as such. A Schur type procedure is used to compute various filter outputs at the intermediate time instants, while some products of vectors with Toeplitz matrices are carried out with the FFT. This leads to the fast subsampled-updating FNTF (FSU FNTF) algorithm, an algorithm that is mathematically equivalent to the FNTF algorithm in the sense that exactly the same filter output is produced. However it shows a significantly smaller computational complexity for large filter lengths at the expense of some relatively small delay. The FSU FNTF algorithm (like the FNTF algorithm) has good convergence and tracking properties. This renders the FSU FNTF algorithm very interesting for applications such as acoustic echo cancellation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6753349","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The fast subsampled-updating fast Newton transversal filter (FSU FNTF) algorithm for adaptive filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The fast subsampled-updating fast Newton transversal filter (FSU FNTF) algorithm for adaptive filtering","sourcePdf":"00877146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039078S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"1","articleId":"877146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":877147,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The proposed circuits are shown to require several times less area than previously reported architectures for particular moduli of operation, while also being preferable in the area/spl times/time complexity sense. The complexity reduction is achieved by extending the carry-ignore property of modulo-2/sup n/ operations to radices higher than two, which are not powers of two. The carry-ignore property is efficiently exploited by introducing simplified digit adders, instead of general radix-r adders. The proposed simplification of digit adders is possible, since the maximum values of certain intermediate digits produced in the architecture are found to be less than r-1. Detailed area and time complexity models are derived for the arithmetic units. The proposed radix-r architectures include multipliers, adders, and merged multipliers-adders. In addition, efficient radix-r binary-to-residue and residue-to-binary conversion techniques and architectures are introduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6753350","volume":"47","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Novel high-radix residue number system architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel high-radix residue number system architectures","sourcePdf":"00877147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070179S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"18987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"15","articleId":"877147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":877148,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Mou Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Mou Huang","id":"38024494500"},{"name":"J.B.

This scheme utilizes a class of 1-D piecewise linear (PWL) map with different discretization on its input and output terminals to realize finite-precision chaotic encryption and decryption systems through the inverse system approach. This kind of map has the property of different discrete-value sets on its input and output terminals, and is called a dual-resolution map. The general structure of encryption systems that utilize a dual-resolution map is proposed, in which a dynamical system /spl Sigma/(/spl middot/) is used to connect the n-order delay line with the input terminal of the dual-resolution map. An example encoder with a four-order delay line is given to promote an understanding of the performance of this new type nonlinear digital encryption system. Simulation results shows that the zero-response of the encoder has a d-like auto-correlation function and the response sequences converge to cyclic sequences with long period.

Sensitivity, however, is a main weakness of CMOS imagers and enhancements and deviations from standard CMOS processes are necessary to keep up sensitivity with downscaled process generations. In the introductory section several definitions for the sensitivity of image sensors are reviewed with regard to their potential to allow meaningful comparison of different detector structures. In the main section, the standard CMOS sensor architecture is compared to detector structures designed to improve the sensitivity, namely the photogate (PG), the pinned photodiode (PPD) and the thin film on ASIC (TFA) approach. The latter uses a vertical integration of the photodiode on top of the pixel transistors. A careful analysis of the relevant electrical, optical and technological parameters and many previously published experimental data for different imagers reveals that only the PPD and the TFA enhancements provide satisfactory sensitivity and withstand scaling down to 0.18 /spl mu/ processes. Due to the higher fill factor and the higher quantum efficiency TFA provides significantly better values than PPD. The radiometric sensitivity of a 5 /spl mu/m/spl times/5 /spl mu/m TFA pixel is found to amount to 11.9 V/(/spl mu//cm/sup 2/) for a 0.25 /spl mu/m process and 27.5 V/(/spl mu/J/cm/sup 2/) for a 0.18 /spl mu/m process.","doi":"10.1109/16.877173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/18988/00877173.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.877173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18988","startPage":"2110","endPage":"2122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity of CMOS based imagers and scaling perspectives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=877173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity of CMOS based imagers and scaling perspectives","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877173/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","accessionNumber":"6751610","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity of CMOS based imagers and scaling perspectives","sourcePdf":"00877173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082048S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"73","articleId":"877173","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":877174,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The unified 1/f noise models assume implicitly that the mobility, limited by Coulomb scattering, does not depend on the inversion carrier density. However, this assumption is not correct in view of theoretical calculations and recent experimental results. In this paper, we show that the correlated mobility fluctuations are negligible, if the correct dependence on inversion carrier density is taken into account for the Coulomb scattering limited mobility. Consequently, the unified 1/f noise models cannot predict the 1/f noise observed experimentally in p-type MOSFETs, except if nonphysical fitting parameters are used. This paper serves as a critical discussion on the unified 1/f noise models for MOSFETs. Here it is not our intention to propose a new 1/f noise model.","doi":"10.1109/16.877177","startPage":"2146","endPage":"2152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.877177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18988","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/18988/00877177.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Critical discussion on unified 1/f noise models for MOSFETs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877177/","displayDocTitle":"Critical discussion on unified 1/f noise models for MOSFETs","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6751614","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Critical discussion on unified 1/f noise models for MOSFETs","sourcePdf":"00877177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032728S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"60","articleId":"877177","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":877178,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This flash EEPROM technology relies on source-side injection for programming and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling for erasing, and has been successfully implemented in a 1 Mbit memory array embedded in a 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, adding only about 30% to the processing cost of digital CMOS. Due to its triple gate structure, the HIMOS(R) cell exhibits a high degree of flexibility and scalability. A fast programming operation (10 /spl mu/s) at 3.3 V supply voltage is combined with an endurance of well over 100000 program/erase cycles, immunity to all possible disturb effects and a retention time that largely exceeds 100 years at 125/spl deg/C. Furthermore, the cell has been scaled to a 0.25 /spl mu/m version, which is a laterally scaled version with the same operating voltages and tunnel oxide thickness. The use of secondary impact ionization is investigated as well and proves to be very promising for future generations when the supply voltage is scaled below 2.5 V.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","accessionNumber":"6751615","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"47","issue":"11","displayDocTitle":"Embedded HIMOS(R) flash memory in 0.35 /spl mu/m and 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded HIMOS(R) flash memory in 0.35 /spl mu/m and 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS technologies","sourcePdf":"00877178.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107373S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"13","articleId":"877178","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":877181,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The SON process' allows the buried dielectric (which may be an oxide but also an-air gap) to be fabricated locally in dedicated parts of the chip, which may present advantages in terms of cost and facility of system-on-chip integration. The SON stack itself is physically confined to the under-gate-plus-spacer area of a device, thus enabling extremely shallow and highly doped extensions, while leaving the HDD (highly doped drain) junctions comfortably deep. Therefore, SON embodies the ideal device architecture taking the best elements from both bulk and SOI and getting rid of their drawbacks. According to simulation results, SON enable ables excellent Ion/Ioff trade-off, suppressed self-heating, low S/D series resistance, close to ideal subthreshold slope, and high immunity to SCE and DIBL down to ultimate device dimensions of 30 to 50 nm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 2000","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","accessionNumber":"6751618","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Silicon-on-Nothing (SON)-an innovative process for advanced CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon-on-Nothing (SON)-an innovative process for advanced CMOS","sourcePdf":"00877181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056279S","chronDate":"Nov 2000","isNumber":"18988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"97","articleId":"877181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":877183,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Programming is performed by channel hot electron injection and erase by tunneling enhanced hot hole injection. The new read methodology is very sensitive to the location of trapped charge above the source. This single device cell has a two physical bit storage capability. The cell shows improved erase performances, no over erase and erratic bit issues, very good retention at 250/spl deg/C, and endurance up to 1M cycles. Only four masks are added to a standard CMOS process to implement a virtual ground array.

An important instance of such a technique is the so-called pyramid decomposition scheme. This paper presents a general theory for constructing linear as well as nonlinear pyramid decomposition schemes for signal analysis and synthesis. The proposed theory is based on the following ingredients: 1) the pyramid consists of a (finite or infinite) number of levels such that the information content decreases toward higher levels and 2) each step toward a higher level is implemented by an (information-reducing) analysis operator, whereas each step toward a lower level is implemented by an (information-preserving) synthesis operator. One basic assumption is necessary: synthesis followed by analysis yields the identity operator, meaning that no information is lost by these two consecutive steps. Several examples of pyramid decomposition schemes are shown to be instances of the proposed theory: a particular class of linear pyramids, morphological skeleton decompositions, the morphological Haar pyramid, median pyramids, etc. Furthermore, the paper makes a distinction between single-scale and multiscale decomposition schemes, i.e., schemes without or with sample reduction. Finally, the proposed theory provides the foundation of a general approach to constructing nonlinear wavelet decomposition schemes and filter banks.","doi":"10.1109/83.877209","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/18990/00877209.pdf","startPage":"1862","endPage":"1876","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.877209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear multiresolution signal decomposition schemes.

Based on an efficient method for evaluating the effect on the mean squared error of trial changes to the halftone image, we show that DBS also minimizes in a pointwise sense the absolute error under the same visual model, but at twice the viewing distance associated with the mean-squared error metric. This dual interpretation sheds light on the convergence properties of the algorithm, and clearly explains the tone bias that has long been observed with halftoning algorithms of this type. It also demonstrates how tone bias and texture quality are linked via the scale parameter, the product of printer resolution and viewing distance. Finally, we show how the tone bias can be eliminated by tone-correcting the continuous-tone image prior to halftoning it.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2000","volume":"9","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","accessionNumber":"6753334","pubMedId":"18262929","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A dual interpretation for direct binary search and its implications for tone reproduction and texture quality","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual interpretation for direct binary search and its implications for tone reproduction and texture quality","sourcePdf":"00877215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055208S","chronDate":"Nov.  2000","isNumber":"18990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"53","articleId":"877215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":877218,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Direct evaluation of TG provides an average completion time of the overall job, assuming no limits exist in the number of processing units and with no regard for allocation schemes. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating TG of jobs executed under predetermined allocation constraints. This extension of TG relies on GSPN (generalized stochastic Petri nets). A systematic mapping of a TG into a GSPN model is discussed. This GSPN model is extended to incorporate information about the static allocation of the set of tasks in the TG. An algorithm is implemented to evaluate static allocation schemes with or without task replication. However, for task replication, a homogeneous system is assumed because the execution time of those tasks does not change when allocated to various processing units. Also, under this assumption, task execution rates are modified by adding communication costs involved in sending data required by the next task, in turn, to execute. Thus, using a single model, TG are evaluated with constraints not only on where replicated and nonreplicated tasks are to be executed but on the number of processing units available, task allocation constraints, and the communication costs involved when they are remotely located.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 2000","publicationDate":"June 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6758371","volume":"49","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Petri-net based performance-evaluation of distributed homogeneous task systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Petri-net based performance-evaluation of distributed homogeneous task systems","sourcePdf":"00877337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027307S","chronDate":"Jun 2000","isNumber":"18992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"4","articleId":"877337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":877338,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Although it has been shown that any convolution mask can, in principle, be implemented by a series of 3/spl times/3 template operations, such methods are time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper we investigate the use of simple CNN-UM algorithms involving only three filtering stages and using only 3/spl times/3 A- and B-templates to approximate desired filter transfer functions. The transfer functions for the structures are derived and a reduced parameterization is introduced. This form is conducive to optimization. Several examples are given wherein filters are designed to approximate a desired transfer function.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2000.877355","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 6th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA 2000) (Cat.

We also show that queries expressed using safe transformations can efficiently be computed without prior knowledge of the transformations. We present a query processing algorithm that uses the underlying multidimensional index built over the data set to efficiently answer similarity queries. Our experiments show that the performance of this algorithm is competitive to that of processing ordinary (exact match) queries using the index, and much faster than sequential scanning.

Most research in this area has focused on efficient query processing of static data. This paper introduces an active spatial data mining approach that extends the current spatial data mining algorithms to efficiently support user-defined triggers on dynamically evolving spatial data. To exploit the locality of the effect of an update and the nature of spatial data, we employ a hierarchical structure with associated statistical information at the various levels of the hierarchy and decompose the user-defined trigger into a set of subtriggers associated with cells in the hierarchy. Updates are suspended in the hierarchy until their cumulative effect might cause the trigger to fire. It is shown that this approach achieves three orders of magnitude improvement over the naive approach that reevaluate the condition over the database for each update, while both approaches produce the same result without any delay. Moreover, this scheme can support incremental query processing as well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to active spatial data mining based on statistical information","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/69.877504","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/19002/00877504.pdf","startPage":"715","endPage":"728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.877504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19002","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=877504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877504/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"An approach to active spatial data mining based on statistical information","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6746516","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to active spatial data mining based on statistical information","sourcePdf":"00877504.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031801S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2000","isNumber":"19002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"84","articleId":"877504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":877513,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Liu","lastName":"Ling Liu","id":"37087151615"},{"name":"C.

A similarity measure between two data is described by a distance function of all constituent attributes and they are defined to be tolerant when their similarity measure exceeds a similarity threshold value. The determination of optimal similarity threshold value is very important for accurate classification. So, we determine it optimally by using the genetic algorithm (GA), where the goal of evolution is to balance two requirements such that: 1) some tolerant objects are required to be included in the same class as many as possible; and 2) some objects in the same class are required to be tolerant as much as possible. After finding the optimal similarity threshold value, a tolerant set of each object is obtained and the data set is grouped into the lower and upper approximation set depending on the coincidence of their classes. We propose a two-stage classification method such that all data are classified by using the lower approximation at the first stage and then the nonclassified data at the first stage are classified again by using the rough membership functions obtained from the upper approximation set. We apply the proposed classification method to the handwritten numeral character classification problem and compare its classification performance and learning time with those of the feedforward neural network's backpropagation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/34.877516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.877516","startPage":"923","endPage":"937","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/19001/00877516.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A handwritten numeral character classification using tolerant rough set","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","displayDocTitle":"A handwritten numeral character classification using tolerant rough set","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"22","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6744982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877516/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A handwritten numeral character classification using tolerant rough set","sourcePdf":"00877516.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03065S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"19001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"33","articleId":"877516","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":877520,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

We have investigated and developed a methodology that serves to automatically identify such a subset of aROIs (algorithmically detected ROIs) using different image processing algorithms (IPAs), and appropriate clustering procedures. In human perception, an internal representation directs top-down, context-dependent sequences of eye movements to fixate on similar sequences of hROIs (human identified ROIs). In the paper, we introduce our methodology and we compare aROIs with hROIs as a criterion for evaluating and selecting bottom-up, context-free algorithms.

The uncertainty of observations obtained from real sensors means that dynamics can be observed only approximately. Learning can still be achieved via \"EM-K\"-expectation-maximization (EM) based on Kalman filtering. This cannot handle more complex dynamics, however, involving multiple classes of motion. A problem arises also in the case of dynamical processes observed visually: background clutter arising for example, in camouflage, produces non-Gaussian observation noise. Even with a single dynamical class, non-Gaussian observations put the learning problem beyond the scope of EM-K. For those cases, we show here how \"EM-C\"-based on the CONDENSATION algorithm which propagates random \"particle-sets,\" can solve the learning problem. Here, learning in clutter is studied experimentally using visual observations of a hand moving over a desktop. The resulting learned dynamical model is shown to have considerable predictive value: when used as a prior for estimation of motion, the burden of computation in visual observation is significantly reduced. Multiclass dynamics are studied via visually observed juggling; plausible dynamical models have been found to emerge from the learning process, and accurate classification of motion has resulted. In practice, EM-C learning is computationally burdensome and the paper concludes with some discussion of computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/34.877523","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/19001/00877523.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.877523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning and classification of complex dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=877523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","displayDocTitle":"Learning and classification of complex dynamics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877523/","volume":"22","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6744989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning and classification of complex dynamics","sourcePdf":"00877523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058976S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"19001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"95","articleId":"877523","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":877525,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The detailed procedure which allows us to keep a symmetric matrix of the system of algebraic equations is presented. The relations between GBC and the other FEM open boundary procedures are briefly discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noniterative implementation of the Green-function-based open boundary condition for FEM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.877559","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/19005/00877559.pdf","startPage":"765","endPage":"768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.877559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=877559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2000","displayDocTitle":"Noniterative implementation of the Green-function-based open boundary condition for FEM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6766072","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noniterative implementation of the Green-function-based open boundary condition for FEM","sourcePdf":"00877559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030595S","chronDate":"July  2000","isNumber":"19005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","articleId":"877559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":877560,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Conductive bodies in relative motion are enclosed in a fictitious surface attached to the conductors. The equivalence theorem is applied to these surfaces and the continuity of tangential components of electric and magnetic fields, taking into account the motional effects, is imposed using the Method Of Moments (M.O.M.). The distribution of electromagnetic fields inside each surface is obtained by means of a Finite Elements Method (F.E.M.) analysis. No re-meshing is required inside and the motional effects are taken into account by means of the boundary conditions. A relevant characteristic of the proposed method is that only a part of the matrices, (namely those involved in the application of MOM), have to be recalculated at each step. The proposed formulation has been tested by comparison with other numerical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid FEM/MOM formulation for eddy current problems with moving conductors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.877572","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/19005/00877572.pdf","startPage":"827","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.877572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=877572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877572/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2000","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid FEM/MOM formulation for eddy current problems with moving conductors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6766085","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid FEM/MOM formulation for eddy current problems with moving conductors","sourcePdf":"00877572.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043624S","chronDate":"July  2000","isNumber":"19005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","articleId":"877572","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":877575,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Numerical verification indicates that the novel PML's offer a serious suppression of dispersion errors and significant savings in the computational burden.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully nonorthogonal higher-order FDTD schemes for the systematic development of 3-D PML's in general curvilinear coordinates","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.877591","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/19005/00877591.pdf","startPage":"912","endPage":"916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.877591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=877591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2000","displayDocTitle":"Fully nonorthogonal higher-order FDTD schemes for the systematic development of 3-D PML's in general curvilinear coordinates","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6766103","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully nonorthogonal higher-order FDTD schemes for the systematic development of 3-D PML's in general curvilinear coordinates","sourcePdf":"00877591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04778S","chronDate":"July  2000","isNumber":"19005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"3","articleId":"877591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":877595,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The novelty of the current approach is the new refinement index derived from an error functional that is based upon the S parameters for the multiport microwave devices. Moreover, the index consists of, from the physical insights of the error functional, two terms: the contributions from residual charges and residual currents. The performance of this novel procedure for various numerical examples, in terms of accuracy in S parameters, are compared with the theoretical rate of convergence. The conclusion drawn from these examples is that the newly proposed mesh refinement index is very effective and accurate in locating regions for refinement. Consequently, it results in a very efficient h-version adaptive mesh refinement procedure.","doi":"10.1109/20.877745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/19005/00877745.pdf","startPage":"1596","endPage":"1599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.877745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive mesh refinement, h-version, for solving multiport microwave devices in three dimensions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=877745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877745/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive mesh refinement, h-version, for solving multiport microwave devices in three dimensions","volume":"36","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2000","accessionNumber":"6774242","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive mesh refinement, h-version, for solving multiport microwave devices in three dimensions","sourcePdf":"00877745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038301S","chronDate":"July  2000","isNumber":"19005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","articleId":"877745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":877747,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The mesh network may benefit from this feature in terms of communication efficiency.

The Ballista testing system was used to characterize the handling of exceptional input parameter values for up to 233 POSIX functions and system calls on each of 15 widely used operating system (OS) implementations. This identified ways to crash systems with a single call, ways to cause task hangs within OS code, ways to cause abnormal task termination within OS and library code, failures to implement defined POSIX functionality, and failures to report unsuccessful operations. Overall, only 55 percent to 76 percent of the exceptional tests performed generated error codes, depending on the operating system being tested. Approximately 6 percent to 19 percent of tests failed to generate any indication of error despite exceptional inputs. Approximately 1 percent to 3 percent of tests revealed failures to implement defined POSIX functionality for unusual, but specified, situations. Between 18 percent and 33 percent of exceptional tests caused the abnormal termination of an OS system call or library function, and five systems were completely crashed by individual system calls with exceptional parameter values. The most prevalent sources of these robustness failures were illegal pointer values, numeric overflows, and end-of-file overruns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","volume":"26","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6738650","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"The exception handling effectiveness of POSIX operating systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The exception handling effectiveness of POSIX operating systems","sourcePdf":"00877845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046057S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"19000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"69","articleId":"877845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":877863,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Primarily, these aircraft include H-60 and H-53 variants. Likewise, Lockheed-Martin has contracted with AIS to demonstrate a propulsion system Prognostics and Health Manager (PHM) for use on their lift-fan equipped Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Preferred Weapon System Concept (PWSC) aircraft. The principal intent is to improve readiness and reduce operational costs using streamlined maintenance practices. The enabling data will be derived through automated condition and health monitoring. Although each HUMS user requires different aircraft- and service-specific functions, the experience of providing these advanced services to a variety of customers enables us to better define those functions and their integration (both on-board and off). This paper presents lessons-learned from several aspects of aerospace HUMS (diagnostics, prognostics and regime recognition) implementations and touches on related areas (conceptual design, system integration, etc.) as needed. These lessons are based on our continuing work with military platform users and designers while making new technology available through the open system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft propulsion","Military aircraft","Aircraft manufacture","Manufacturing","Helicopters","Prognostics and health management","Weapons","Costs","Computerized monitoring","Condition monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["helicopters","aircraft maintenance","weapons","military aircraft","economics","fault diagnosis","failure analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotary-wing HUMS","fixed-wing HUMS","Integrated Health and Usage Management Systems","service-specific helicopters","H-60","H-53","Lockheed-Martin","propulsion system prognostics","lift-fan","Joint Strike Fighter","readiness","operational costs","streamlined maintenance","diagnostics","regime recognition","conceptual design","system integration","military platform","open system","fuzzy logic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AERO.2000.877916","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

(Key agreement, especially in a group setting, is the stepping stone for all other security services.) Dynamic peer groups require not only initial key agreement (IKA) but also auxiliary key agreement (AKA) operations, such as member addition, member deletion, and group fusion. We discuss all group key agreement operations and present a concrete protocol suite, CLIQUES, which offers complete key agreement services. CLIQUES is based on multiparty extensions of the well-known Diffie-Hellman key exchange method.

We assume that the stations are small, bulk-produced, hand-held devices running on batteries and cannot be distinguished by serial or manufacturing number. Since recharging batteries may not be possible while on mission, we are interested in designing protocols that are highly energy-efficient. The initialization problem is to assign each of the n stations in the RN a unique ID. The initialization problem is nontrivial since the stations are assumed to be indistinguishable. The problem is fundamental, since practically all communication protocols for RNs proceed under the assumption that the RN has been initialized in advance. The main contribution of this work is to propose energy-efficient randomized initialization protocols for single-hop RNs lacking collision detection capabilities. First, we show that if the number n of stations is known beforehand, the single-channel RN can be initialized by a protocol that terminates, with probability exceeding 1-/sup 1///sub n/ in O(n) time slots, with no station being awake for more than O(log log n) time slots. We then go on to address the multichannel case and show that if k, (k/spl ges/1), channels are available, an n-station RN can be initialized, with probability exceeding 1-/sup 1///sub n/, in O(/sup n///sub k/+log n) time slots, with no station being awake for more than O(log log n) time slots.","doi":"10.1109/71.877942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.877942","startPage":"851","endPage":"863","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/19004/00877942.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient initialization protocols for single-hop radio networks with no collision detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 2000","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient initialization protocols for single-hop radio networks with no collision detection","publicationDate":"Aug. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"11","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6740086","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/877942/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient initialization protocols for single-hop radio networks with no collision detection","sourcePdf":"00877942.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035823S","chronDate":"Aug 2000","isNumber":"19004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"33","articleId":"877942","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":877948,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A system with an array of n transmit and m receiver antennas where (m/spl ges/n) is assumed. Both finite-length (finite horizon) and infinite-length (infinite horizon) MIMO decision feedback equalizers are considered. We also assume an ISI (inter-symbol-interference) MIMO channel, which means the channel matrix elements are frequency selective. For the infinite-length case the DFE problem leads to solving a matrix spectral factorization. For the finite-length case the DFE problem leads to solving a corresponding Cholesky factorization. Using the estimation-based spectral factorization we have shown that the solution to the infinite-length MIMO DFE is not unique. In the finite-length case the estimation-based approach leads to a recursive algorithm to perform the Cholesky factorization. The proposed recursive algorithm has low complexity and is also simple to implement. Moreover it leads to a closed form solution for the MIMO DFE matrices.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An estimation-based approach to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel equalization","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

This means that a base station can set apart a subset of the codes, the excess codes, that it will not use. In the case of periodic codes (such as in the TDD mode of UMTS) the existence of excess codes implies the existence of a noise subspace, which can be used to cancel the interference coming from a neighboring base station. We introduce a SINR maximising linear receiver to perform this interference reduction. In the case of aperiodic codes (such as in the FDD mode of UMTS) the noise subspace is time-varying. In this case, we introduce structured receivers that combine scrambling and descrambling operations with projections on code subspaces and linear time-invariant filters for equalization, interference cancellation and multipath combining. So the time-varying part of these receivers is limited to (de-)scrambling operations. The design of the various filter parts gets discussed. Performance improvements are illustrated via simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop. SAM 2000 (Cat.

Multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver have the potential to significantly increase the capacity of a wireless communications channel. That is, using multiple-input (MIMO) techniques with these antennas, multiple independent channels can be supported in the same bandwidth, but only if the scattering environment is rich enough. Recent research has shown that high theoretical capacity is possible-data rates as high as 40 bits/s/Hz have been demonstrated (in an indoor slow fading environment). However, in cellular mobile radio, the channel differs in several important ways from the indoor channel. Therefore, to determine the potential of MIMO techniques for 3G and 4G wireless systems, we conducted the first field tests to characterize the mobile MIMO radio channel in a typical cellular environment. We present field test results showing the potential increase in capacity using 4 transmit and 4 receive antennas at both the base station and terminal in a mobile environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

These simulation results provide an upper-bound on average BER performance for users near a single transmitting base-station, in which the channel is assumed static and known. We present results for two channel models: a random 4-path multipath channel with delay spread of 10 micro seconds, and an empirically derived random multipath channel generated by the commercial software package SMRCIM. We compare the cases of diversity obtained by two spatially separated antennas to two \"virtual channels\" obtained through oversampling a single antenna's received signal. This simulation study has yielded the expected result that spatial diversity is preferable to diversity obtained via oversampling. Furthermore, the MMSE always out-performs both RAKE and ZF equalizers.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

It is well known that undesirably high sidelobes are generated when the unaugmented sample covariance matrix is used as an estimate of the true covariance matrix in adaptive beamforming algorithms. In practice, diagonal loading is frequently employed to reduce this deleterious effect. However, surprisingly little information is available in the technical literature that enables the user to predict the statistical performance of the MVDR algorithm when the sample covariance matrix and diagonal loading are employed. We help fill this gap by generating an approximate probability density function for the adaptive beam response for the diagonally loaded MVDR algorithm. The approximations are valid for an important class of signal scenarios. The utility of the new analysis is demonstrated via simulation. In particular, the new results are used to estimate the probability density function of the range sidelobe level for a wideband radar system in which adaptive beamforming and pulse compression are implemented in subbands.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

The mobile is assumed to have one omnidirectional antenna. In one approach, we consider selecting assuming no interference, the two most powerful beams produced by an RF beamformer. In the other approach, we make a compromise between power and Doppler spectrum partitioning. One channel is a beam that points directly at the mobile. The other beam is the difference of left and right beams, symmetric about the mobile. These left and right beams are Doppler compensated prior to forming their difference. Using computer simulation, we find that selecting beams based on power is more effective than selecting beams based on Doppler partitioning. We also find that using the two most powerful beams formed from eight antenna elements yields 7 dB and 8 dB SNR improvements, at 1.9 GHz and 5.8 GHz, respectively, relative to spatial diversity with two omnidirectional antennas.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2000.877989","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

To realize these gains, a number of space-time coding strategies have previously been proposed. Most of these algorithms assume that, via training data, the channel is known at least on one end of the link. However if the channel is time-varying or even just quasi-stationary, the training overhead can offset much of the throughput gain. In this paper a space-time coding scheme is presented that allows for simultaneous blind or semi-blind channel estimation and decoding of the symbols transmitted by multiple users. The method relies on the use of \"diagonal\" space-time codes in which the same symbol is successively transmitted from each antenna in turn. This structure leads to a simple subspace-based algorithm that produces closed-form estimates of both the channel and the transmitted symbols. The algorithm is shown to be applicable to cases involving fewer receive than transmit antennas, rank-deficient channels, flat or frequency selective fading, and multiple users.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2000.877992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18961","startPage":"173","endPage":"177","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

As technological advances make it possible to perform wide bandwidth processing and future systems require high resolution for target identification, the need has arisen for the effective implementation of wideband STAP. In order to prevent the deleterious effects of dispersion for wideband systems, STAP is performed in subbands, which is also computationally more efficient than full bandwidth STAP. The separate, independent adaptive processing in the individual subbands, however, introduces complications that must be addressed in order to maintain desired performance. These issues are unique to subband STAP, namely, target Doppler dispersion across subbands and range sidelobe levels following subband recombination. In each case, we identify the cause of the problem and propose an effective solution. Throughout this paper, we focus on practical solutions that are tractable and do not require an inordinate amount of computation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

Subsequently, the concept of pre-filters are introduced to convert white sources, which do not satisfy this sufficient condition, into color ones that do satisfy it. Based on the sufficient condition and the pre-filters, a set of theorems are developed for blind MIMO-FIR channel equalization, which only use the SOS of the received signals.

With this decomposition, the first user can be recovered by a linear interference cancellation algorithm.

Subband decomposition facilitates a computational complexity efficient approach to the adaptive beam-forming problem. We derive optimal adaptive weights in the subband domain using two optimality criteria: (a) maximum SINR, and (b) minimum MSE. It is shown that, unlike the narrow-band case where these criteria yield the same weights up to an overall multiplicative constant, here the two criteria result in different adaptive weights. Explicit conditions for this approach are given. Further, an approach for avoiding spatial mismatch errors is shown.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2000.878018","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

SAM 2000 (Cat. No.00EX410)","abstract":"An important trend in underwater acoustics is the use of large arrays with many elements and small resolution cells in an effort to detect weak signals. Frequently, the background noise is dominated by multiple moving surface ships that act like discrete interferers. These interferers may move through many spatial resolution cells in the time required to obtain sufficient \"snapshots\" for covariance matrix estimation. The non-stationarity of the background limits the performance of adaptive algorithms. Reduced degree-of-freedom approaches that can track and rapidly null interferers before they move too far are of great interest. The paper presents a new class of algorithms in which a low-rank, dynamically changing interference sub-space is estimated and tracked using a short-term average. An orthogonal projection is then applied to the data to null components in the interference sub-space. A second stage of adaptive beamforming that uses a longer averaging time is then applied to the projected data. Unlike most sub-space approaches that work for strong signals, there is no requirement that the signal be contained in the interference sub-space. It is shown how multiple interferers moving rapidly across beams can be tracked and nulled to reveal the presence of a weak target not visible with conventional, adaptive, or usual sub-space methods. The effectiveness of multi-rate adaptive beamforming is illustrated by examples. It is shown that moving interferers are effectively nulled to allow detection of weak signals when other methods including MVDR, conventional, and signal subspace fail.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2000.878019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18961","startPage":"306","endPage":"309","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

In contrast to \"iterative-form\" algorithms, in a \"direct-form\" algorithm the mixing matrix is estimated directly from the observed data, using a single pass to collect some statistics. The statistics exploited by our algorithm are the empirical second-derivative matrices of the second joint characteristic function of the observations, evaluated at selected points, termed \"processing points\". Applying approximate joint diagonalization to these matrices yields a consistent estimate of the mixing matrix (under some mild regularity conditions) in the noiseless as well as in the noisy case, whenever the noise is Gaussian and spatially white. For spatially correlated Gaussian noise, a slightly modified version of the algorithm can still produce consistent estimates. The performance depends strongly on the choice of processing points, and can compare favorably to other BSS algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2000.878031","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

DAs are array-source configurations whose array elements are spatially dispersed submerging the sources in the nearfield of the array, where they can be distinguished not only by their angular but also by their range signature. The resulting enhanced spatial discrimination capabilities reflected in a beampattern characterized by spot-like mainlobes lend DAs optimality properties. A gradient based algorithm for the joint optimization of the array geometry and the shading coefficients of a narrowband spot-beamformer in a stationary multiple source system is derived, and its convergence and performance are discussed. An important subclass of DAs, namely distributed linear arrays are introduced. This class is of practical significance and has the important property of being; ambiguity-free in the limit for high SNR.

To mitigate signal fading and ICI, we introduce a frequency-space domain equalization (FSDE) using an antenna array. Unlike conventional combining diversity or selection diversity, this scheme differs in that it attempts to prevent the occurrence of the frequency-selective fading and ICI rather than compensates for them. A FSDE on the received OFDM signal is performed by space-time Fourier transform (STFT) and frequency-domain equalization (FDE). While a time-domain Fourier transform in STFT demodulates OFDM signals, a space-domain Fourier transform attenuates the OFDM signals arriving at the antenna array through unwanted paths. This approach includes the blind estimation of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) for the multiple paths by employing the cyclostationarity of the OFDM signal. A FDE is applied to the output of the STFT to compensate for the effect of the remaining ICI. The effectiveness of FSDE is examined in terms of the resulting frequency-selective fading, ICI and SINR gain.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2000.878046","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

In a broadband mobile system operating at 2 GHz or higher, there is a strong potential for severe levels of time and frequency selectivity, which must be accurately tracked for proper multi-user demodulation and interference suppression. We present new frequency-domain techniques that allow for multi-user demodulation even in the presence of high levels of frequency selectivity, and severe time variations across a data block (where a data block is defined to be a group of samples that are FFTd into the frequency domain). These techniques include a time-varying multi-user channel estimation process and a frequency-domain adaptive antenna combining algorithm. The efficacy of the channel estimator and adaptive antenna combining algorithm is demonstrated through simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

Though both of these subjects have a long and extensive history, we believe that our work is the first to relate these two rather different signal processing approaches. The concept at the heart of both approaches is the multi-static frequency response matrix (FRM) of the active antenna array. It is a function of array/scatterer geometry (via a suitable Green function) and of the scatterers' reflection coefficients. The time-reversal technique locates the most reflective target by determining the largest singular value of the FRM and the corresponding (right) singular vector. Consequently, it performs well only when the scatterers are \"well-resolved,\" i.e., when the Green function vectors used in forming the FRM are approximately orthogonal to each other. In contrast, we show that subspace-based signal processing can be successfully used even when the targets are not \"well-resolved.\" Moreover, the performance of our subspace-based schemes can be further enhanced by using wideband signals and combining FRM information from multiple frequencies. The coupling of time-reversal field processing with subspace methods leads to a powerful approach for locating targets under arbitrary wave-propagation conditions (both near-field and far-field), including arbitrary non-homogeneous media and arbitrary geometries.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2000.878061","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

Massive quantities of data must be reduced in a way that identifies useful features. Pixel clustering algorithms provide one approach: each pixel is assigned to a class based on the spectral similarity of that pixel to other members of the class. An image where each pixel is represented by its class provides a single picture (not hundreds of channels) for the analyst to interpret. Opportunities for fine-grain parallelism in this computationally intensive calculation motivate the consideration of specialized hardware. We are developing an FPGA-based implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm, because FPGAs can provide considerable speedup yet are sufficiently flexible to permit the testing of variants and tradeoffs. Assigning pixels to classes requires a definition of spectral similarity. The standard choice is the Euclidean distance. We consider two alternative distances: the Manhattan (sum of the absolute coordinate differences) and the Max (maximum of the absolute differences). The Euclidean distance is optimal in the sense of minimizing within-class variance, but requires computing many squares. The Manhattan and Max distances eliminate this squaring, and furthermore reduce the number of bits needed to store intermediate calculations. We conducted two sets of experiments to assess the tradeoff between quality of clustering and efficiency of hardware implementation. The first considered an idealized setup for assessing mis-classification rates and their effect on within-class variance. The second evaluated within-class variance for real 224-channel AVIRIS data sets. Both experiments confirmed that the highest quality clusters are achieved using the Euclidean metric, and quantified the difference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design tradeoffs in a hardware implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop.

A novel TD-CDMA downlink transmission scheme is proposed. This scheme is termed joint transmission (JT). It utilizes the knowledge of the channel impulse responses gained by channel estimation at the base station in such a way that channel estimators are no longer required at the mobile stations and the computational expense of data detection is dramatically reduced.

The loop consists of a digital coherent TED and a loop filter with lowpass characteristic. In a multipath fading environment, one such loop can be allocated for each finger in a RAKE receiver and the interference from adjacent paths can be mitigated by adaptively prefiltering the signal prior to the correlation process. The filter coefficients are computed online in order to minimize an interference cost function. Multipaths whose delays differ by as little as one chip duration become resolvable and can be tracked, resulting in significant performance gains of the overall system, especially if the channel delay spread is small. The tracking performance of the proposed loop is assessed by computer simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

The improved PIC receiver proposed by Divsalar et al. (see IEEE Trans. Commun., vol.46, no.2, p.258-68, 1998) significantly reduces the degrading effect on the desired user of interference by removing from each user a part of the interference produced by the remaining users accessing the channel the amount being proportional to their reliability. The MMSE estimator, a hyperbolic tangent function, is used as a tentative decision device of the improved PIC receiver for the optimum BER performance. The BER of the improved PIC receiver with the MMSE estimator as a tentative decision device is obtained by simulations and compared with those of the conventional PIC receiver and the improved PIC receiver with a signum function as a tentative decision device. The BER change with respect to the weight factors in the hyperbolic tangent functions is shown for the multi-stage improved PIC receiver. Also, the BER performance in near-far situations and with the channel estimation error is shown over Rayleigh fading channels. From the numerical results, it is shown that the improved PIC receiver with a hyperbolic tangent function achieves remarkable performance improvement over the conventional PIC receiver and the improved PIC receiver with a signum function.

To solve this problem, we present a new system model and modify three near-far resistant time delay estimators, i.e., the MMSE estimator, the MUSIC estimator and the large sample maximum likelihood (LSML) estimator, and apply them in this scenario. According to the theoretical analysis and the simulation results presented, it is shown that in an AWGN channel, the modified MUSIC estimator can not work well when the system is heavily loaded since the subspace dimensionality is increased to 3 K instead of 2 K in the unfiltered case, where K is the number of CDMA users. The modified LSML estimator offers satisfactory performance but its computational complexity is high, whereas the modified MMSE estimator can acquire timing delay in a short period without significant additional computation complexity and cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation delay estimation in asynchronous CDMA overlay","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

In a CDMA environment, where the advantages of low rate coding for spreading purposes can be exploited, a coding-diversity gain, also known as space-time gain, can be achieved. This paper presents the new concept of layered super-orthogonal turbo transmit diversity (SOTTD) for code division multiple access (CDMA) communications. The techniques of spreading and coding at low-rate are married with code-division transmit diversity (CDTD) and iterative \"turbo\" processing. In layered space-time TC CDTD, a turbo encoder (and its associated iterative decoder) is required for every transmit diversity branch available. In SOTTD a single turbo encoder-decoder pair is required, making it a practically feasible solution. The only requirement being that the number of constituent encoders Z, should be greater or equal to the transmit diversity order M/sub T/. The principle of operation is to transmit the coded bits, stemming from the constituent encoders, via the spatial domain rather than via the time, code or frequency domain. The received data stream is then iteratively decoded using turbo decoding principles. SOTTD performance is compared with TC CDTD using both simulations and theoretical bounds.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of super-orthogonal turbo-transmit diversity for CDMA cellular communication","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

The MC-CDMA system carries out energy spreading in all available sub-channels or in the frequency domain. It also performs multi-carrier modulation using a set of orthogonal (or biorthogonal) filters. The optimisation of these filters is done based on their time-frequency characteristics and depends also on the application. Here the biorthogonal filters are implemented with M-band wavelet-based system in a form of cosines modulated filters to configure a perfect reconstruction system. The simulation results show that this WB-MC-CDMA system suffers lower interchannel interference, thus making its response more robust against multipath fading and narrow band interference or jamming signal.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

In every subband, the SIC receiver successively detects the interferers' signals and substracts them from that of the user-of-interest. The SIC receiver employs maximal-ratio combining (MRC) for detection of the desired user, and feeds a soft decision Viterbi decoder. A comparison is made among SIC-MRC, matched filter detection with maximal-ratio combining (MF-MRC), and N-tap minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receivers with optimal tap coefficients, assuming a slowly varying, frequency selective, Rayleigh fading channel, where N is the processing gain. Analysis and simulation results show that the SIC-MRC can obtain a performance comparable to that of N-tap MMSE receivers, and both of them have better ability to suppress multiple-access interference (MAI) than does the MF-MRC. On the other hand, more powerful codes do not necessarily guarantee the better performance, since frequency diversity will decrease caused by a lower code rate. Finally, with small tracking errors, results show that SIC-MRC can still retain a performance advantage over MF-MRC.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.878101","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

The performance of the system employing (i) random orthogonal codes and (ii) Walsh codes are investigated in a simulated non-directed line-of-sight infrared channel. An approximation to the bit error probability is given by using a Gaussian approximation for the intersymbol interference due to multipath propagation. The average probability of error as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio is used as the performance criteria. Results show that an M-ary orthogonal DS system is able to combat the effect of multipath dispersion since only small power penalties are incurred while increasing the system spectral efficiency. It is observed that Walsh codes have slightly worse performance than random orthogonal codes in a dispersive infrared channel, and the Gaussian approximation becomes more accurate as the length of the code sequence increases.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.878108","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

Both synchronous systems with orthogonal codes and asynchronous systems are considered. It is shown that in a broad range of cases, the nonlinear distortion in the decision variables at the receiver can be modeled by means of a complex scale factor and an additive noise, which is uncorrelated to the useful signal. Moreover, an analytical formulation of the bit error probability and total degradation (TD) as a function of output back-off (OBO) and number of user is given and the results are discussed for three classes of HPA models, the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA), the solid state power amplifier (SSPA) and the amplifier with ideal predistortion (IPA).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of CDMA systems with nonlinear amplifier and AWGN","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

The enhanced transmission security arises from the stochastic nature of the unique spectrum spreading and de-spreading processes. In a self-encoded multiple access (SEMA) system, the number of users is not limited by the number of available sequences, unlike CDMA systems that employ PN codes such as m-, Gold or Kassami sequences. It is important from a design standpoint to specify the minimum number of chips to support multiple users for a specified quality of service and capacity in SEMA system. We find the number of chips for an m-user SEMA system to achieve the specified capacity and bit error rate. The capacity analysis provides a useful indication of the maximum number of users for a given spreading factor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.878115","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

It is shown that the performance of classical training-based schemes is severely degraded due to the code-multiplexing (as opposed to time-multiplexing) of traffic and pilot signals. The time-dispersivity of the channel destroys the orthogonality between the traffic signal and the pilot, and consequently the traffic signal appears as a new interfering signal for the channel estimation/beamforming algorithm. In order to avoid this effect, we propose techniques that exploit both the presence of the training sequence and the structure of the traffic signal in a semi-blind fashion.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

In contrast to the conventional TED it is well suited for the case of multipath propagation channels. In order to accomplish this task a compensation term is introduced inside the tracking loop directly behind the conventional TED. This compensation term is calculated using the knowledge on the relative delays of all paths and their respective channel coefficients. A compensation scheme like the one described here becomes necessary whenever closely spaced paths have to be tracked. This fact makes this algorithm a favorable candidate for indoor scenarios where individual paths can be spaced even more closely than one chip. The performance of the presented scheme is assessed by means of simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2000.878128","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Sixth International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications.

We show a faster parallel decoding algorithm which runs on the PRAM EREW in O(log n) time with O(n) processors for text compressed by a standard implementation of the LZ2 algorithm (next character heuristic). We observe that LZ1 parallel decoders also can have such speed up. Moreover, we address a different implementation of LZ2 compression called identity heuristic.

The application to regular expressions is discussed, explaining how the algorithms can be used to implement, for example, substring addressing and a lookahead operator, and an informal comparison to other widely-used algorithms is made.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NFAs with tagged transitions, their conversion to deterministic automata and application to regular expressions","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventh International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval.

After initial tuning, the local clock remains calibrated when environmental conditions change. Each module of a large system on a chip can use one of these clock generators running at the optimal frequency for the module. Communication between locally synchronous blocks is provided by a globally asynchronous interconnect. Reliable low latency communication between the asynchronous interconnect and a local clock domain is made possible by stretching the local clock if a metastable condition could be encountered. Stretching the clock just requires the rising clock edge to be prevented from entering the tuned delay line. Similarly, a sleep state can be entered by stopping the clock and wakeup is almost instantaneous. Fine grained sleeping is possible by sleeping whenever there is no work to be undertaken and waking up as soon as new data appears over the asynchronous interconnect.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2000.878271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2000.878271","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/7044/18963/00878271.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self calibrating clocks for globally asynchronous locally synchronous systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","displayDocTitle":"Self calibrating clocks for globally asynchronous locally synchronous systems","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2000","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6748989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self calibrating clocks for globally asynchronous locally synchronous systems","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00878271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084758S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7044","citationCount":"42","articleId":"878271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":878286,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

Power-conscious design must therefore go beyond technology and low-level design, but also change the way modern processors are architected. A multithreading processor is attractive in the context of low-power or power-constrained devices for many of the same reasons that enable its high throughput. Primarily, it supplies extra parallelism via multiple threads, allowing the processor to rely much less heavily on speculation. We show that a simultaneous multithreading processor utilizes up to 22% less energy per instruction than a single-threaded architecture. We also explore other power optimizations that are particular to multithreaded architectures, either because they are unavailable to or unreasonable for single-thread architectures.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2000.878286","startPage":"199","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/7044/18963/00878286.pdf","endPage":"206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2000.878286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878286/","displayDocTitle":"Power-sensitive multithreaded architecture","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6749004","publicationDate":"2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-sensitive multithreaded architecture","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00878286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036752S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7044","citationCount":"35","articleId":"878286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":878290,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The scheme takes DRAM access timing into consideration in order to reduce prefetching overhead, amortizing the high cost of DRAM access by fetching two cache lines that reside on the same DRAM-page in a single access. On each DRAM access, one or two cache blocks may be prefetched. We combine three prediction mechanisms: history mechanism, stride, and one block lookahead, make them DRAM page sensitive and deploy them in an effective adaptive prefetching strategy. Our simulation shows that the prefetch mechanism can greatly improve system performance. Using a 32-KB prediction table cache, the prefetching scheme improves performance by 26%-55% on average over a baseline configuration, depending on the memory model. Moreover, the simulation shows that prefetching is more cost-effective than simply increasing L2-cache size or using a one block lookahead prefetching scheme. Simulation results also show that DRAM-page based prefetching yields higher relative performance as processors get faster, making the prefetching scheme more attractive for next generation processors.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000 International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/7044/18963/00878296.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2000.878296","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2000.878296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DRAM-page based prediction and prefetching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DRAM-page based prediction and prefetching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878296/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6749013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DRAM-page based prediction and prefetching","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00878296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046093S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7044","citationCount":"1","articleId":"878296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":878301,"authors":[{"name":"Hak-Soo Yu","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Research Center, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hak-Soo Yu","id":"37853429000"},{"name":"Songjun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Songjun Lee","id":"38026385000"},{"name":"J.A.

Programs used for industrial process control are traditionally written in a graphical language called relay ladder logic, and implemented on programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The mapping of ladder logic onto typical FPGAs is a lengthy process, and results are hard to verify. We propose an FPGA architecture implementing relay ladder logic directly. Conversion to Boolean algebra is eliminated. Technology mapping is simple and direct. Placement and routing are also considerably simpler than in the general FPGA case. The architecture scales to devices of differing sizes and resources.

Usually these source coding algorithms determine speech or audio parameters which are highly sensitive to transmission errors. This paper deals with an error concealment technique that benefits from residual redundancy remaining after source coding. Due to delay and complexity constraints a certain amount of inter-frame as well as intra-frame correlation between source codec parameters remains which might be exploited to enhance the subjective audio quality. In this contribution we propose an algorithm which is able to utilize both types of redundancy if the source parameters exhibit a two-dimensional Markov property. Actually, this approach is nearly optimal in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) sense but much less complex compared to the optimal estimator.","doi":"10.1109/SCFT.2000.878405","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Workshop on Speech Coding.

The narrowband input signal is classified into a limited number of speech sounds for which the information about the wideband spectral envelope is taken from a pre-trained codebook.

Thus, the software aspects of system reliability are an increasingly important concern. Current methods of software and system reliability prediction-whether measurement based or incorporating reliability growth models-cannot accurately predict failure rates of greater than 10/sup -6/ per mission hour. This paper describes a new methodology for more accurately predicting failure rates of very high reliability systems. The methodology enhances conventional measurement-based reliability assessment with a method incorporating the results of stress testing called importance sampling. By means of importance sampling in conjunction with a system model, acceleration factors can be associated with stress testing much as is currently done with elevated temperature life testing of hardware components.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Software systems","Reliability","Life testing","Control systems","Current measurement","Software measurement","Predictive models","Stress measurement","Life estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["importance sampling","safety-critical software","software metrics","program testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer-based control systems","system reliability","failure rates prediction","measurement-based reliability assessment","stress testing","importance sampling","system model","acceleration factors","very high reliability software","operational profile","parameter estimation","critical software"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AERO.2000.878464","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

Though they may have excellent gain patterns on the test range, their patterns may not be ideal when they are placed in the presence of the other metal structures on the satellite. Due to interactions with these structures, the antenna patterns may develop nulls and other distortions that render their performance unacceptable. These problems are not necessarily possible to fix with conventional antennas, even with automated optimization techniques like the genetic algorithm (GA). However, the genetic antenna, an antenna with no predefined theory of operation but one that is \"invented\" by a GA, is shown in this research to be capable of accounting for these surrounding structures. These non-intuitive antennas intentionally couple into surrounding structures to achieve patterns nearly as good as, and in some cases better than, antennas optimized without them.","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

These estimates should be at the scale of future, higher resolution mesoscale atmospheric models, i.e., something like 10 km. We can produce these estimates through satellite remote sensing of moisture in the upper 5 cm of soil. Stored water is a product of assimilating into land-surface process models the near-surface soil moisture at a spatial scale of significant precipitation events and a temporal scale of moisture retention in near-surface soils. The challenge for remote sensing technologists is to converge upon sensor technologies that will meet observational requirements at affordable development and operational costs. For many reasons, we believe that the appropriate sensor is an L-band radiometer based upon Synthetic Thinned Array Radiometry (STAR) technology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2000.878482","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

Since microwave analog beamformers basically require much less RF devices than digital beamformer, the microwave analog beamformers based on M-CMA, that is adaptive microwave beamformers, can be cheaply fabricated. Therefore, they are much suitable for mobile communication systems where both miniaturization and low-cost are required for the equipment. Actually, M-CMA obtains the gradient vector by perturbing the microwave beamforming control voltage. Though M-CMA is implemented with a digital signal processor, M-CMA controls the microwave analog beamformer by utilizing the gradient vector. The microwave analog beamformer based on M-CMA is analyzed to have the following characteristics. (1) The beamformer can point its main beam to the desired direction in AWGN channels. (2) Although the beamformer has possibility to fail in ill solutions in CCI (Co-Channel Interference) channels, M-CMA can converge to the optimum solution when the desired direction is roughly a priori known.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6795655","conferenceDate":"25-25 March 2000","displayDocTitle":"M-CMA for digital signal processing adaptive antennas with microwave beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M-CMA for digital signal processing adaptive antennas with microwave beamforming","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"00878488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051395S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7042","citationCount":"3","articleId":"878488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":878499,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We outline the methodology used to develop a detailed radiation fault model for the REE Testbed architecture. The model addresses the effects of energetic protons and heavy ions which cause single event upset and single event multiple upset events in digital logic devices and which are expected to be the primary fault generation mechanism. Unlike previous modeling efforts, this model will address fault rates and types in computer subsystems at a sufficiently fine level of granularity (i.e., the register level) that specific software and operational errors can be derived. We present the current state of the model, model verification activities and results to date, and plans for the future. Finally, we explain the methodology by which this model will be used to derive application-level error effects sets.

Networks of devices will be widely deployed for monitoring applications. In these new applications, users need to query very large collections of devices in an ad hoc manner. Most existing systems rely on a centralized system for collecting device data. These systems lack flexibility because data is extracted in a predefined way. Also, they do not scale to a large number of devices because large volumes of raw data are transferred. In our new concept of a device database system, distributed query execution techniques are applied to leverage the computing capabilities of devices, and to reduce communication. We define an abstraction that allows us to represent a device network as a database and we describe how distributed query processing techniques are applied in this new context.","doi":"10.1109/98.878531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/98/19016/00878531.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.878531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Querying the physical world","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Querying the physical world","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6756441","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Querying the physical world","sourcePdf":"00878531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051986S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"19016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"230","articleId":"878531","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":878532,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The problem of localization, that is, determining where a given node is physically located in a network, is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applications. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimental results show that the accuracy for 90 percent of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance. However, future work is needed to extend the technique to more cluttered environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878533/","volume":"7","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6756443","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"GPS-less low-cost outdoor localization for very small devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPS-less low-cost outdoor localization for very small devices","sourcePdf":"00878533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022122S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"19016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"2189","articleId":"878533","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":878536,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Collectively, these devices would provide a smart environment. Before this vision can become a reality, significant challenges must be overcome in the design of access protocols, and in spectrum management policies. Some devices in a smart environment must be able to communicate, and all devices in a smart environment must be able to coexist without excessive mutual interference. This article discusses various methods of achieving these goals, and the fundamental trade-offs involved. Some of the alternative methods include the allocation of unlicensed spectrum for this purpose, establishment of an etiquette that constrains access protocol designs, adoption of a full standard for access protocols, and the creation of a spectrum band manager.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/98/19016/00878543.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"68","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/98.878543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.878543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=878543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless communications and coexistence for smart environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Access protocols","Interference constraints","Quality of service","Technological innovation","Costs","Frequency","Protection","Radio spectrum management","Personal communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","radio spectrum management","telecommunication standards","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless communications","smart environments","small intelligent devices","access protocols","radio spectrum management policies","mutual interference","unlicensed spectrum","standards","spectrum band manager"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Wireless communications and coexistence for smart environments","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6756452","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless communications and coexistence for smart environments","sourcePdf":"00878543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030003S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"19016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"35","articleId":"878543","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":878598,"authors":[{"name":"Feng-Li Lian","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, Engineering Research Center for Reconfigurable Machining Systems, USA"],"lastName":"Feng-Li Lian","id":"37300823500"},{"name":"J.R.

An extended Kalman-Bucy filter (EKBF) relies on an accurate model of system rigid-body dynamics and measured motion to estimate an external friction torque. The friction estimate is used in a traditional friction compensator to cancel friction effects. The paper motivates and describes estimation method and reports results of friction compensation experiments. In addition, the EKBF compensator is compared with other friction compensation strategies, both model-based and non-model based. Experimental results for each compensator are presented for position tracking with velocity reversals. When motion is dominated by static and Stribeck friction, the EKBF-based compensator consistently provides more than fifty percent RMS tracking error reduction over a well-tuned PID compensator, and equal or superior tracking performance over other compensation methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878675/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6795458","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive friction compensation using extended Kalman-Bucy filter friction estimation: a comparative study","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive friction compensation using extended Kalman-Bucy filter friction estimation: a comparative study","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00878675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028974S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"19012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7046","citationCount":"15","articleId":"878675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":878704,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Suk Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyun Suk Ko","id":"37088146650"},{"name":"Jung-Su Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jung-Su Kim","id":"37087638678"},{"name":"Tae-Woong Yoon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae-Woong Yoon","id":"37087275210"},{"name":"Mokeun Lim","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, Korea University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Mokeun Lim","id":"37088147882"},{"name":"Dae Ryuk Yang","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, Korea University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae Ryuk Yang","id":"37088147457"},{"name":"Ik Soo Jun","affiliation":["POSCON Corp., Korea University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ik Soo Jun","id":"37088143242"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5519-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"878704","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=878704","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Predictive control","Furnaces","Iron","Metals industry","Temperature control","Billets","Productivity","Control systems","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steel industry","process control","hot rolling","process heating","furnaces","predictive control","temperature control","multivariable control systems","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modeling","predictive control","reheating furnace","iron industry","steel industry","hot charge rolling processes","billet temperature control","rolling process performance","productivity","material balance","energy balance","multivariable controller design procedure","system identification technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2000.878704","pdfPath":"/iel5/7046/19012/00878704.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 American Control Conference.

With SIPN, logic controllers are modeled by places-setting output signals-and transitions between those places-depending on Boolean functions of input signals. This model has interesting dynamics: Firstly, several transitions can fire simultaneously. Secondly, there can be iterated firing of transitions before a new stable marking is reached. In standard PLC programming languages, there is no direct means to implement these dynamics. In this contribution a method for the generation of transparent PLC code from SIPN is presented (using instruction list or ladder diagram). The code is transparent because there is a one-to-one correspondence between SIPN elements and code segments. A new analytical method to guarantee the correct dynamics of the implemented code is presented and compared to existing approaches. The new method results in a special ordering of the code segments. The presented analysis of the SIPN shows if a transition t/sub a/ can fire in an iteration after transition t/sub b/. In this case, the code segment describing t/sub b/ has to be processed prior to the one of t/sub a/. A solution for the case, where the analysis results in an impossible ordering is also presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic control","Fires","Programmable control","Petri nets","Signal analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Logic programming","Boolean functions","Computer languages","Dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable controllers","Petri nets","Boolean functions","iterative methods","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Petri net based control algorithms","signal interpreted Petri nets","SIPN","control algorithm modeling","control algorithm analysis","setting output signals","Boolean functions","simultaneous transitions","iterated transition firing","transparent PLC code generation","instruction list","ladder diagram","code segment ordering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=878725","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2000.878725","startPage":"2819","endPage":"2823 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 American Control Conference.

This is a different approach to traditional systems that use the actual time-of-flights (TOF) from the transmitter to the different receivers and triangulate the position of the transmitter. The new approach makes the system more accurate, makes the transmitter independent of the receivers and does not require the need of calculating the time delay term that is inherent in traditional systems due to delays caused by the electronic circuitry. This paper presents a thorough analysis of receiver configurations in the 2D and 3D system that lead to singularities, i.e. locations of receivers that lead to formulations that can not be solved due to a shortage of information. It provides guidelines of where not to place receivers so as to get a robust system. It further presents a detailed analysis of locations that are optimal, i.e. locations that lead to the most accurate estimation of the transmitter positions. This is accomplished by using genetic algorithms to search for the optimal configurations.

Optimal energy management is related to the optimization of the instantaneous generation/storage power split in SHEV. Previously, a power split type solution of the series hybrid energy management problem has been attempted using a rule-based approach. Our approach performs a dynamic programming solution of the problem of determining the optimal power split between both sources of energy, with realistic cost calculation for all considered power trajectories for the combined APU/generator, electric machines and battery efficiencies, and a penalty function formulation for the deviation of the ideal state-of-charge to be sustained over the length of time considered. The discrete state formulation of this dynamic programming approach makes the computation very efficient. Results are obtained for series hybrids for the FUDS drive cycle.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal energy management in series hybrid electric vehicles","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 American Control Conference.

The advantages of the proposed technique are demonstrated through an application to an autonomous underwater vehicle. The design requirement is for attitude control such that robust trajectory following is achieved. A detailed nonlinear model of the AUV is given, and an operating point for nominal design is selected, about which a linear approximation is obtained.

Based on the traditional space vector concept for PWM inverters, the sequence of the space vector is randomized in this scheme. The overall vector, resulting from the randomization, is mathematically identical to that of the traditional space vector. It has been found that the randomized scheme can effectively spread the switching noise over a wide frequency range and at the same time keep the steady-state link capacitor voltage balanced. The proposed scheme has been implemented in a digital controller and its features have been experimentally confirmed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE 31st Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference.

The proposed scheme can effectively solve the stability problem associated with the drive using V/f (Volts per Hertz) control. By integrating the active damping control into the V/f control, the stability of the drive is substantially improved and the LC resonance caused by the inverter capacitor and motor inductance is effectively suppressed. In addition, the drive system using this scheme becomes less parameter sensitive and easy to implement. The performance of the proposed drive is investigated through eigenvalue analysis. A 5 hp prototype drive is constructed and the theoretical analysis is verified by experiments. The feasibility of using this control scheme in high power drives is also investigated.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2000.878803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2000.878803","startPage":"61","endPage":"66 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE 31st Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference.

Space vector control techniques are widely adopted for high performance drives while the control system is most conveniently implemented by microprocessors, microcontrollers and DSPs. Space vector pulse width modulation is also an appropriate technique for the phase current modulation of a current source converter (CSC). Either \"5-switch\" or \"4-switch\" space vector modulation can be used, the latter being perhaps more popular. Different modulation strategies can be developed by selecting an appropriate vector sequence for the switching cycle. Therefore this paper discusses the significance of the vector sequence on the IGBT switching voltages in order to reduce switching losses of the CSC bridge. An optimal vector modulation strategy, which minimizes the switching losses of the CSC bridge, is developed and analyzed in detail. Finally, the results are verified by PSpice(R) simulations.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2000.878821","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE 31st Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference.

The four-legged PFC rectifier is controlled by a three-dimensional space vector modulation (3D SVM) scheme, and runs in the overmodulation region when the source is unbalanced and/or a leg failure occurs. Modeling and control of the four-legged PFC rectifier are presented. Under unbalanced source, operation of the four-legged rectifier with three control strategies-equal current, equal resistance and constant power are analyzed. Two rectifier failure modes are studied: (1) entire leg fails; (2) active switches fail with the anti-parallel diodes still functional. It turns out that in both failure modes, the PFC rectifier can have an equal or higher than 2/3 of the rated output power level. The operation of the four-legged rectifier with 3D SVM is demonstrated by experimental results. The simulation results show that the proposed four-legged rectifier is advantageous over directly coupled three single-phase PFC rectifier and three-legged three-phase PFC rectifier.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE 31st Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference.

The algorithm generates a stealthy path through a set of enemy radar sites of known location, and provides an intuitive way to trade-off stealth versus path length. In the first step, a suboptimal rough-cut path is generated through the radar sites by constructing and searching a graph based on Voronoi polygons. In the second step, a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations are simulated, using the graph solution as an initial condition. The ODEs describe the dynamics of a set of virtual masses located in a virtual force field. The virtual forces push the masses away from the radar and toward one another. The ODEs are simulated to find a locally, exponentially stable equilibrium solution, which is interpreted as the optimal path. A simulation is provided to illustrate the idea.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878915/","accessionNumber":"6770035","isConference":true,"volume":"1","issue":"6","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Path planning for UAVs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path planning for UAVs","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00878915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034898S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"19018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7046","citationCount":"151","articleId":"878915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":878916,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In applications, these algorithms are used to determine and track the parameters that optimize a system level cost function in real time. The design of multiparameter ESA is greatly facilitated by the availability of simple models that explain the algorithm operation. In this paper, a simple model for stability and performance calculations is given. The model approximates the behavior of the ESA with an accuracy that improves as the dither frequencies used by the ESA are increased. The model predicts ESA stability and performance even if the cost function measurements are corrupted by noise or additional process dynamics. The model is for the general case of multivariable online optimization. Our approach to the analysis supports the addition of dynamic compensation in the ESA. Guidelines for the selection of the dither and the dynamic compensator are derived from our model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878937/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6770050","publicationDate":"2000","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of multivariable extremum seeking algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of multivariable extremum seeking algorithms","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00878937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025708S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"19018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7046","citationCount":"95","articleId":"878937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":878939,"authors":[{"name":"Hwan Il Kang","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Information Control Eng, Myongji University, South Korea","Myongji University, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, KR"],"lastName":"Hwan Il Kang","id":"37087259415"},{"name":"Yo Won Junag","lastName":"Yo Won Junag","id":"37086970922"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5519-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"878939","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=878939","abstract":"The step response of the Manabe standard form (1998) has few overshoots and shows almost same waveforms regardless of the order of the characteristic polynomial. In some situations it is difficult to control the rise time and settling time simultaneously of the step response of the Manabe standard form. To control its rise time and settling time efficiently, we develop the generalization of the Manabe standard form: we try to find out the SRFS (slow rise time and fast settling time) form which has the slower rise time and faster settling time than those of the Manabe standard form, we also consider the other three forms: the FRSS form, the FRFS form, and the SRSS form. In this paper, by using the genetic algorithm, we obtain the four forms we mentioned above. Finally, we design a controller for a given plant so that the overall system has the performance that the rise time is faster and the settling time is slower than those of the Manabe standard form.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2000.878939","startPage":"444","endPage":"447 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 American Control Conference.

In this paper, convergence theorems of discrete Hopfield-type neural networks with delay are obtained. Under a proper assumption, i.e., which weight matrix is a symmetric matrix, it is proved that any discrete Hopfield-type neural networks with delay will converge to a stable state operating in serial mode, and extends convergence theorems in earlier works. The authors also relate the maximum of bivariate energy function to the stable state of neural networks with delay. In other words, this network can converge to a stable state in only one delay step while the energy function has converged. The correlation between convergence of the energy function and convergence corresponding to the network is also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/878982/","accessionNumber":"6770095","isConference":true,"volume":"1","issue":"6","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Convergence of discrete Hopfield-type neural networks with delay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence of discrete Hopfield-type neural networks with delay","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00878982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041865S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"19018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7046","citationCount":"1","articleId":"878982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":878985,"authors":[{"name":"Mingxuan Sun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Mingxuan Sun","id":"37087196435"},{"name":"Danwei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Danwei Wang","id":"37087172215"},{"name":"Guangyan Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Guangyan Xu","id":"37087485458"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5519-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"878985","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=878985","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Sampling methods","Iterative methods","Error correction","Sun","Couplings","Digital control","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled data systems","nonlinear systems","learning systems","iterative methods","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative learning control","SISO systems","nonlinear systems","sampled-data systems","convergence"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a sampled-data iterative learning control method for SISO nonlinear systems with arbitrary relative degree, which does not require any differential approximation of the tracking error.

The theory develops a simple and effective way to perform gradient descent in the parameter space. One version of the tuning algorithm requires no knowledge of the plant to be controlled. This makes the algorithm robust to changes in the plant. It also makes the algorithm universally applicable to linear and nonlinear plants. The algorithm achieves the tuning objective by minimizing an error function. Because of its simplicity, the overhead for adding self-tuning is negligible. We applied this algorithm in an automotive product manufactured by Hitachi to satisfy performance requirements for both cold start and normal operation. Simulation results are presented to show the validity of the approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-tuning of PID controllers by adaptive interaction","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 American Control Conference.

Maneuver planning as a global optimization problem is solved using genetic algorithms (GA). Methods were devised to reduce the dimensionality of the decision space, yet retain adequate generality of maneuver possibilities. A compact formulation based on thruster switching-times was used for generic point-to-point spacecraft maneuvers. Optimal control is implicitly satisfied by \"bang-coast-bang\" actuation schemes. Maneuver profiles, including line-of-sight and orthogonal collision avoidance, were developed. A GA optimizer selects the optimal parameter set for each scenario. Simulation case studies were performed for 2, 3 and 5-spacecraft formation initialization tasks. Objective criteria used in the evaluation function included: endpoint errors; collision avoidance; path lengths; maneuvering times; fuel usage and equalization. In all cases, a nominal GA computed feasible trajectories. Objective criteria trade-offs were demonstrated by selective weighting. Ongoing work includes multi-objective optimization of multiple spacecraft trajectories using niched-Pareto genetic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2000.879279","startPage":"99","endPage":"108 vol.7","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

Emphasis is given to caches that are transparent to the clients since they are easier to manage and they require no cooperation from the clients. Our goal is to minimize the overall flow or the average delay by placing a given number of caches in the network. We formulate these location problems both for general caches and for transparent en-route caches (TERCs), and identify that, in general, they are intractable. We give optimal algorithms for line and ring networks, and present closed form formulae for some special cases. We also present a computationally efficient dynamic programming algorithm for the single server case. This last case is of particular practical interest. It models a network that wishes to minimize the average access delay for a single web server. We experimentally study the effects of our algorithm using real web server data. We observe that a small number of TERCs are sufficient to reduce the network traffic significantly. Furthermore, there is a surprising consistency over time in the relative amount of web traffic from the server along a path, lending a stability to our TERC location solution. Our techniques can be used by network providers to reduce traffic load in their network.","doi":"10.1109/90.879344","startPage":"568","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/19026/00879344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.879344","endPage":"582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The cache location problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/879344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"The cache location problem","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6747240","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The cache location problem","sourcePdf":"00879344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036356S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"19026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"256","articleId":"879344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":879345,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A suite of admission control algorithms, based on the DPC/ALP one, is also studied. They are distributed/autonomous and operate using local interference measurements. A primarily networking approach to power control is taken here, based on the concept of active link protection, which naturally supports the implementation of admission control.

The network cost includes the cost of the transceivers required at the nodes as well as the number of wavelengths. The transceiver cost includes the cost of terminating equipment as well as higher-layer electronic processing equipment, which in practice can dominate over the cost of the number of wavelengths in the network. The networks support dynamic (i.e., time-varying) traffic streams that are at lower rates (e.g., OC-3, 155 Mb/s) than the lightpath capacities (e.g., OC-48, 2.5 Gb/s). A simple OADM ring is the point-to-point ring, where traffic is transported on WDM links optically, but switched through nodes electronically. Although the network is efficient in using link bandwidth, it has high electronic and opto-electronic processing costs. Two OADM ring networks are given that have similar performance but are less expensive. Two other OADM ring networks are considered that are nonblocking, where one has a wide-sense nonblocking property and the other has a rearrangeably nonblocking property.

The framework is based on the idea of the Nash bargaining solution from cooperative game theory, which not only provides the rate settings of users that are Pareto optimal from the point of view of the whole system, but are also consistent with the fairness axioms of game theory. We first consider the centralized problem and then show that this procedure can be decentralized so that greedy optimization by users yields the system optimal bandwidth allocations. We propose a distributed algorithm for implementing the optimal and fair bandwidth allocation and provide conditions for its convergence. The paper concludes with the pricing of elastic connections based on users' bandwidth requirements and users' budget. We show that the above bargaining framework can be used to characterize a rate allocation and a pricing policy which takes into account users' budget in a fair way and such that the total network revenue is maximized.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/19026/00879352.pdf","startPage":"667","endPage":"678","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.879352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.879352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=879352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A game theoretic framework for bandwidth allocation and pricing in broadband networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Game theory","Channel allocation","Pricing","Intelligent networks","Broadband communication","Bandwidth","High-speed networks","Telecommunication traffic","Distributed algorithms","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","costing","game theory","optimisation","convergence","broadband networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theoretic framework","bandwidth allocation","broadband networks","elastic services","high-speed networks","Nash bargaining solution","cooperative game theory","rate settings","Pareto optimal rate settings","fairness","centralized problem","decentralization","greedy optimization","system optimal bandwidth allocations","distributed algorithm","convergence","elastic connections","bandwidth requirements","budget","rate allocation","pricing policy","network revenue"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/879352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"A game theoretic framework for bandwidth allocation and pricing in broadband networks","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6747248","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A game theoretic framework for bandwidth allocation and pricing in broadband networks","sourcePdf":"00879352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041632S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"19026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"509","articleId":"879352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":879358,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The method is based on the initiation of a pulsed electric discharge inside the solid dielectric material. With pulse amplitudes of /spl sim/300 kV, material layers of /spl sim/2 cm can be punctured. Specific energy deposition, of /spl lsim/100 J/cm at a GW power level, leads to pressure buildup of /spl lsim/10/sup 10/ Pa in the discharge channel. Pressure waves and radially propagating cracks are launched into the solid body, which can lead to the separation of inclusions from the matrix or to detachment at material boundaries. To induce the discharge in the solid dielectric it must be immersed in a dielectric liquid with higher breakdown strength. Most applications use water, which has excellent breakdown strength at fast ramp rates and, due to its high permittivity, leads to field concentration in the solid dielectric. Electric impulse fragmentation is a clean physical method without any environmental burden and therefore well suited for recycling applications. In this paper we consider applications in the fields of demolition debris, incineration ashes, contaminated surface layers, electric appliances, glass, and elastoplastic materials. Finally, the economy and the scaling of the technique to large material throughput are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/94.879358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.879358","endPage":"636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/19027/00879358.pdf","startPage":"625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of pulsed HV discharges to material fragmentation and recycling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/879358/","displayDocTitle":"Application of pulsed HV discharges to material fragmentation and recycling","volume":"7","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6756525","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of pulsed HV discharges to material fragmentation and recycling","sourcePdf":"00879358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039191S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"19027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"112","articleId":"879358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":879360,"authors":[{"name":"H.

An adversary can neither successfully tap the quantum transmissions, nor evade detection, owing to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. In this paper we describe the theory of quantum cryptography, and recent results from our experimental free-space system with which we have demonstrated the feasibility of quantum key generation over a point-to-point outdoor atmospheric path in daylight. We achieved a transmission distance of 0.5 km, which was limited only by the length of the test range. Our results provide strong evidence that cryptographic key material could be generated on demand between a ground station and a satellite (or between two satellites), allowing a satellite to be securely re-keyed on orbit for encrypting the uplinked command path and downlinked data path; or to distribute keys between widely-separated ground stations with a satellite relay, enabling encrypted communications over even inter-continental distances.

A major challenge in this area is to automatically generate a relatively small set of test cases that, collectively, guarantees a selected degree of coverage of the behavior space. This paper describes an algorithm for a parametric test case generation tool that applies a combinatorial design approach to the selection of candidate test cases. Evaluation of this algorithm on test parameters from the Deep Space One mission reveals a valuable reduction in the number of test cases, when compared to an earlier home-brewed generator.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2000.879426","pdfPath":"/iel5/7042/19022/00879426.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"437 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

We summarize the available theoretical results on rates of convergence for the four algorithm forms and then use the theoretical results to draw some preliminary conclusions on the relative efficiency. Our aim is to sort out some of the competing claims of efficiency and suggest a structure for comparison that is more general and transferable than the usual problem-specific numerical studies.

The adaptive critic approach consists of two neural networks which output the control values and the Lagrangian multipliers associated with optimal control. These networks are trained successively and when the outputs of the two networks are mutually consistent and satisfy the differential constraints, the controller network output produces optimal control. In this paper, we analyze the mechanics of convergence of the network solutions. We establish the necessary conditions for the network solutions to converge and show that the converged solution is optimal.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2000 American Control Conference.

The goal of method proposed in this paper is to design such link distribution network that satisfies the growing and changing load demand during the long term planning period with minimal service costs subject to voltage drop, cable and transformer capacity limits, limited number of feeders outgoing at HV/MV substations and limited number of load points per link. The method is based on biologically inspired genetic algorithm (GA). Basic GA procedures adapted to the given problem that enable simultaneous routing of all links between HV/MV substations are presented. Six versions of crossover operators are compared. The results reveal that that the method is able to produce results of a kind not easily obtained before namely in terms of an amount of information about the solutions and the solution space.","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.2000.879674","pdfPath":"/iel5/7056/19030/00879674.pdf","startPage":"887","endPage":"890 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 10th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference.

Sites in the network request data items and each request has an associated deadline and priority. In a military situation, the data staging problem involves positioning data for facilitating a faster access time when it is needed by programs that will aid in decision making. This work concentrates on solving a basic version of the data staging problem in which all parameter values for the communication system and the data request information represent the best known information collected so far and stay fixed throughout the scheduling process. The network is assumed to be oversubscribed and not all requests for data items can be satisfied. A mathematical model for the basic data staging problem is introduced. Then, three multiple-source shortest-path algorithm-based heuristics for finding a near-optimal schedule of the communication steps for staging the data are presented. Each heuristic can be used with each of four cost criteria developed. Thus, 12 implementations are examined. In addition, two different weightings for the relative importance of different priority levels are considered. The performance of the proposed heuristics are evaluated and compared by simulations. The proposed heuristics are shown to perform well with respect to upper and lower bounds. Furthermore, the heuristics and a complex cost criterion allow more highest priority messages to be received than a simple-cost-based heuristic that schedules all highest priority messages first.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/19033/00879779.pdf","doi":"10.1109/71.879779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.879779","startPage":"969","endPage":"988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mathematical model and scheduling heuristics for satisfying prioritized data requests in an oversubscribed communication network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/879779/","displayDocTitle":"A mathematical model and scheduling heuristics for satisfying prioritized data requests in an oversubscribed communication network","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"6767653","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mathematical model and scheduling heuristics for satisfying prioritized data requests in an oversubscribed communication network","sourcePdf":"00879779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040341S","chronDate":"Sep 2000","isNumber":"19033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"26","articleId":"879779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":879785,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The acceleration of this class of algorithms is achieved by skipping empty macro regions, which are defined for each background voxel of the volume. Background voxels are labeled in a preprocessing phase by a value, defining the macro region size, which is equal to the voxel distance to the nearest foreground voxel. The CD algorithm exploits the chessboard distance and defines the ray as a nonuniform sequence of samples positioned at voxel faces. This feature assures that no foreground voxels are missed during the scene traversal. Further, due to parallelepipedal shape of the macro region, it supports accelerated visualization of cubic, regular, and rectilinear grids. The CD algorithm is suitable for all modifications of the ray tracing/ray casting techniques being used in volume visualization and volume graphics. However, when used for rendering based on local surface interpolation, it also enables fast search of intersections between rays and the interpolated surface, further improving speed of the process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/879785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul-Sep 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul-Sep 2000","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2000","accessionNumber":"6743336","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Fast ray-tracing of rectilinear volume data using distance transforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast ray-tracing of rectilinear volume data using distance transforms","sourcePdf":"00879785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038713S","chronDate":"Jul-Sep 2000","isNumber":"19034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"54","articleId":"879785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":879788,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, such accuracy is not easily attained due to various error sources that can affect the image formation process. Current calibration methods typically assume that the observations are unbiased, the only error is the zero-mean independent and identically distributed random noise in the observed image coordinates, and the camera model completely explains the mapping between the 3D coordinates and the image coordinates. In general, these conditions are not met, causing the calibration results to be less accurate than expected. In the paper, a calibration procedure for precise 3D computer vision applications is described. It introduces bias correction for circular control points and a nonrecursive method for reversing the distortion model. The accuracy analysis is presented and the error sources that can reduce the theoretical accuracy are discussed. The tests with synthetic images indicate improvements in the calibration results in limited error conditions. In real images, the suppression of external error sources becomes a prerequisite for successful calibration.","doi":"10.1109/34.879788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/19035/00879788.pdf","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.879788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometric camera calibration using circular control points","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=879788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/879788/","displayDocTitle":"Geometric camera calibration using circular control points","volume":"22","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6766369","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric camera calibration using circular control points","sourcePdf":"00879788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025798S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"19035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"548","articleId":"879788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":879789,"authors":[{"name":"Te-Won Lee","affiliation":["Institute for Neural Computation, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, Howard Hughts Medical Institute, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Te-Won Lee","id":"37277271300"},{"name":"M.S.

This paper proposes a simple method for recovering the distortion parameters without the use of any calibration objects. Since distortions cause straight lines in the scene to appear as curves in the image, our algorithm seeks to find the distortion parameters that map the image curves to straight lines. The user selects a small set of points along the image curves. Recovery of the distortion parameters is formulated as the minimization of an objective function which is designed to explicitly account for noise in the selected image points. Experimental results are presented for synthetic data as well as real images. We also present the idea of a polycamera which is defined as a tightly packed camera cluster. Possible configurations are proposed to capture very large fields of view. Such camera clusters tend to have a nonsingle viewpoint. We therefore provide analysis of what we call the minimum working distance for such clusters. Finally, we present results for a polycamera consisting of four wide-angle sensors having a minimum working distance of about 4 m. On undistorting the acquired images using our proposed technique, we create real-time high resolution panoramas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/19035/00879797.pdf","startPage":"1172","endPage":"1178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.879797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.879797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=879797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonmetric calibration of wide-angle lenses and polycameras","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Lenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","photographic lenses","calibration","image processing","curve fitting","noise","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonmetric calibration","wide-angle lenses","polycameras","wide-angle cameras","distortion parameter recovery","straight lines","image curves","minimization","noise","tightly packed camera cluster","nonsingle viewpoint","minimum working distance","wide-angle sensors","image undistortion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/879797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Nonmetric calibration of wide-angle lenses and polycameras","volume":"22","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6766378","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonmetric calibration of wide-angle lenses and polycameras","sourcePdf":"00879797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059735S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"19035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"141","articleId":"879797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":879815,"authors":[{"name":"N.E.

They tested a range of basic software engineering hypotheses relating to: the Pareto principle of distribution of faults and failures; the use of early fault data to predict later fault and failure data; metrics for fault prediction; and benchmarking fault data. For example, we found strong evidence that a small number of modules contain most of the faults discovered in prerelease testing and that a very small number of modules contain most of the faults discovered in operation. We found no evidence to support previous claims relating module size to fault density nor did we find evidence that popular complexity metrics are good predictors of either fault-prone or failure-prone modules. We confirmed that the number of faults discovered in prerelease testing is an order of magnitude greater than the number discovered in 12 months of operational use. The most important result was strong evidence of a counter-intuitive relationship between pre- and postrelease faults; those modules which are the most fault-prone prerelease are among the least fault-prone postrelease, while conversely, the modules which are most fault-prone postrelease are among the least fault-prone prerelease. This observation has serious ramifications for the commonly used fault density measure. Our results provide data-points in building up an empirical picture of the software development process.","doi":"10.1109/32.879815","startPage":"797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/19036/00879815.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.879815","endPage":"814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative analysis of faults and failures in a complex software system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/879815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 2000","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative analysis of faults and failures in a complex software system","volume":"26","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6724936","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative analysis of faults and failures in a complex software system","sourcePdf":"00879815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043039S","chronDate":"Aug 2000","isNumber":"19036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"390","articleId":"879815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":879820,"authors":[{"name":"A. van Lamsweerde","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement d'Ing\u00e9nierie Informatique, Univerwsit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"A.","lastName":"van Lamsweerde","id":"37267732800"},{"name":"E.

Requirements engineering processes often result in goals, requirements, and assumptions about agent behavior that are too ideal; some of them are likely not to be satisfied from time to time in the running system due to unexpected agent behavior. The lack of anticipation of exceptional behaviors results in unrealistic, unachievable, and/or incomplete requirements. As a consequence, the software developed from those requirements will not be robust enough and will inevitably result in poor performance or failures, sometimes with critical consequences on the environment. This paper presents formal techniques for reasoning about obstacles to the satisfaction of goals, requirements, and assumptions elaborated in the requirements engineering process. The techniques are based on a temporal logic formalization of goals and domain properties; they are integrated into an existing method for goal-oriented requirements elaboration with the aim of deriving more realistic, complete, and robust requirements specifications. A key principle is to handle exceptions at requirements engineering time and at the goal level, so that more freedom is left for resolving them in a satisfactory way. The various techniques proposed are illustrated and assessed in the context of a real safety-critical system.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/19037/00879820.pdf","startPage":"978","endPage":"1005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handling obstacles in goal-oriented requirements engineering","doi":"10.1109/32.879820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.879820","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=879820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/879820/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2000","displayDocTitle":"Handling obstacles in goal-oriented requirements engineering","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2000","accessionNumber":"6744964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handling obstacles in goal-oriented requirements engineering","sourcePdf":"00879820.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070917S","chronDate":"Oct 2000","isNumber":"19037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"355","articleId":"879820","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":879853,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The most useful technique is to determine the spectra from the image. Once these spectra are found, the image cube can be \"unmixed\" into fractional abundances of each material in each pixel. Several autonomous methods, ORASIS, the first real time autonomous algorithm; N-FINDR, an algorithm that determines end members by inflating a simplex, and Iterative Error Analysis (LEA) which finds end members by iterative unmixing are compared in this paper. Computer implementations of the three autonomous algorithms are evaluated using hyperspectral AVIRIS data of Cuprite, Nevada. The fractional abundance maps produced by the three algorithms are compared to a mineral map made by the USGS based upon an AVIRIS scene, and the end member spectra are compared to library spectra.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

Because of the high target density and maneuverability, high clutter, low visibility due to terrain masking, etc., ground target tracking presents unique challenges not present in tracking other types of targets. This paper reviews major developments in multi-target tracking over the past four decades and discusses how algorithms developed primarily for tracking air targets can be used for tracking ground targets. The similarities and differences between found and air target tracking are first compared. We then discuss how simple target state estimation algorithms such as Kalman filtering have evolved into more complicated algorithms for tracking maneuvering targets. Similarly, we discuss how association algorithms have progressed from nearest neighbor to joint probabilistic data association (JPDA), multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT), and multi-dimensional assignment. The adequacy of these techniques for tracking ground targets is discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/879870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-25 March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6778034","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Ground target tracking-a historical perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ground target tracking-a historical perspective","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"00879870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087682S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"19038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7042","citationCount":"13","articleId":"879870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":879893,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

From this understanding, a method is proposed to apply the harmonically superior phase disposition (PD) PWM strategy for NPC inverters to cascaded inverters, to achieve improved harmonic performance for the modulation of cascaded inverters.

Many of them are robust to within class appearance variation of subjects such as variation in expression, lighting and pose. However, most of the face identification systems developed, are sensitive to changes in the age of individuals. In this paper we demonstrate that automatic age simulation techniques can be used for designing face recognition systems, robust to ageing variation. In this context, the perceived age of the subjects in the training and test images is modified before the training and classification procedures, so that ageing variation is eliminated. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our face recognition system can be improved significantly, when this approach is adopted.","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.2000.879974","publicationTitle":"2000 10th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference.

By transcription we mean the conversion of an audio recording of a polyphonic piano performance to a series of notes and their starting times. Our final goal is to build a transcription system that would transcribe polyphonic piano music over the entire piano range and with large polyphony. The system consists of three main stages. We first use a cochlear model based on the gammatone filterbank to transform an audio signal of a piano performance into time-frequency space. In the second stage we use a network of coupled adaptive oscillators to extract partial tracks from the output of the cochlear model and in the third stage we employ artificial neural networks acting as pattern recognisers to extract notes from the output of the oscillator network. The system uses several networks each trained to recognize the occurrence of a specific note in the input signal.","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.2000.879982","startPage":"512","endPage":"515 vol.2","publicationTitle":"2000 10th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference.

To enable the tracking of objects having similar gray-level intensity during contacts, we use dynamic information extracted by computing sparse optical flow along the object contours. Optical flow vectors are used for updating the positions of the tracked contours in a sequence of image frames. The local properties of optical flow enable the system to track the objects during and after contact, when parts of object contours become hidden. The missing dynamic information is reconstructed by using a model of constant optical flow along an object contour. To deal with the contours of changing-shape, a contour-correcting procedure based on an active contour model is added. The robustness of the tracking algorithm is improved by adding a supervision module, which detects tracking failures and reinitializes the lost contours. The system has been tested on real sequences with laboratory animals during pharmacological experiments and has been shown to be sufficiently robust and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.2000.879990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=19013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MELCON.2000.879990","endPage":"545 vol.2","publicationTitle":"2000 10th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference.
