Liepins et al. (1990) have shown that genetic algorithm optimization of certain combinatorial optimization problems can be more effective when the genetic algorithm evaluates \"repaired\" versions of the chromosomes. In this sense \"repairing\" a chromosome means to take an illegal chromosome and force it to be legal through some repair function, Liepens does not however, advocate returning this \"repaired\" version of the chromosome to the population. Other researchers also advocate \"repairing\" illegal chromosomes, but they claim that returning the \"repaired\" version of the chromosome to the population \"improves the convergence rates and solution quality\". In this paper we show that a combination of these strategies supports another performance enhancing technique, a variety of Lamarckian evolution in which, with a small probability, original chromosomes are replaced in the population by their \"repaired\" counterparts. Using this strategy, replacing original chromosomes with a 5% probability, on three different combinatorial optimization problems, performance was better than either never replacing or always replacing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Constraint optimization","Biological cells","Collaboration","Genetic mutations","Law","Legal factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","optimisation","constraint handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","feasibility constraints","combinatorial optimization problems","illegal chromosome","Lamarckian evolution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350001","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.350001","startPage":"548","endPage":"553 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

Although the importance of diversity in choosing offspring in a gene pool has been addressed in the past, few authors have discussed how to maintain diversity in real-world applications. Most existing suggestions are based on a balanced distribution of candidates, but this is not a realistic assumption for search problems in a multidimensional space. We show in this paper that when more than one coach is used in a game-playing environment, the collective learning result is better than other learning curves in which only a single coach is involved, no matter whether the coach is the best one or the worst one. We also use expanded chromosomes for measuring position scores in a static evaluation function to achieve improved learnability. Our work can be classified under the evolutionary strategy paradigm mentioned by K. De Jong and W.

They are the binary coded GA and the order-based GA. We have already proposed a new type of binary coded GA, called the forking GA (fGA), as a kind of multi-population GA and showed that the searching power of the fGA is superior to the standard GA. The distinguished feature of the fGA is that each population takes a different role in optimization. That is, each population is responsible for searching in a non-overlapping sub-area of the search space. In this paper, the extended forking GA for order representation, called the o-fGA, is proposed. The results of experiments for the blind traveling salesperson problem (TSP) show that the approach of fGA is also effective for the order representation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350021/","accessionNumber":"4812311","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Extended forking genetic algorithm for order representation (o-fGA)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended forking genetic algorithm for order representation (o-fGA)","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00350021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025423S","chronDate":"27-29 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1125","citationCount":"3","articleId":"350021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":350022,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The clusters information in the graph of the routing solution is used in the proposed inter-cluster mutation operators. The inter-cluster mutation integrates the concept of gradient descendent method, implicitly, into the genetic algorithm based channel router.

Historically, multiple objectives have been combined ad hoc to form a scalar objective function, usually through a linear combination (weighted sum) of the multiple attributes, or by turning objectives into constraints. The genetic algorithm (GA), however, is readily modified to deal with multiple objectives by incorporating the concept of Pareto domination in its selection operator, and applying a niching pressure to spread its population out along the Pareto optimal tradeoff surface. We introduce the Niched Pareto GA as an algorithm for finding the Pareto optimal set. We demonstrate its ability to find and maintain a diverse \"Pareto optimal population\" on two artificial problems and an open problem in hydrosystems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1994.350037","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation.

A novel differential clock feedthrough attenuation (DCFA) technique is developed to attenuate the signal-dependent clock feedthrough errors. Unlike conventional techniques, the DCFA circuit allows the use of dynamic mirror techniques, and results in no additional finite output resistance errors or device mismatch errors. The test chip of the proposed fully differential CSH circuit with multiple outputs has been fabricated in 1.2-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. Using a single 5-V power supply, experimental results show that the signal-dependent clock feedthrough error current is less than /spl plusmn/0.4 /spl mu/A for the input currents from -550 /spl mu/A to 550 /spl mu/A. The acquisition time for a 900-/spl mu/A step transition to 0.1% settling accuracy is 150 ns. For a 410-/spl mu/A/sub p-p/ input at 250 MHz with the fabricated fully-differential CSH circuit clocked at 4 MHz, a total harmonic distortion of -60 dB, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 79 dB have been obtained. The active chip area and power consumption of the fabricated CSH circuit are 0.64 mm/sup 2/ and 20 mW, respectively. Both simulation and experimental results have successfully verified the functions and performance of the proposed CSH circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Circuit testing","CMOS technology","Attenuation","Mirrors","Power supplies","Total harmonic distortion","Signal to noise ratio","Energy consumption","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample and hold circuits","harmonic distortion","errors","analogue processing circuits","synchronisation","CMOS analogue integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS current sample/hold circuits","differential clock feedthrough attenuation","accuracy limitations","signal-dependent clock feedthrough errors","dynamic mirror techniques","multiple outputs","single 5-V power supply","total harmonic distortion","signal-to-noise ratio","power consumption","SNR","S/H circuit","1.2 micron","-550 to 550 muA","150 ns","250 kHz","4 MHz","79 dB","20 mW","5 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/4.350189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8062/00350189.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.350189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precise CMOS current sample/hold circuits using differential clock feedthrough attenuation techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precise CMOS current sample/hold circuits using differential clock feedthrough attenuation techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350189/","volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4866832","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precise CMOS current sample/hold circuits using differential clock feedthrough attenuation techniques","sourcePdf":"00350189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039847S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"22","articleId":"350189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":350190,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

Results from 2 /spl mu/ and 1.2 /spl mu/ test chips designed to measure the performance of buffered and unbuffered CMOS latches with respect to loading and supply voltages are presented. While the optimum synchronizer in CMOS technology has been previously shown to be an unbuffered, unloaded latch, our results show that buffered latches have better mean time between failure (MTBF) performance for all loads greater than a fanout of one with sufficient resolution time. However, MTBF performance still degrades exponentially with loading in buffered latches. A normalization scheme to compare latches with different supplies and technologies is presented with data from the test chips. Improvements in latch metastable parameters with increased supply or reduced channel length are shown to be reduced when the effects of shorter on-chip delays are factored in. In a given technology, normalized metastable parameters are shown to be unchanged for a wide range of supply voltages, allowing calculation of metastable parameters in supply voltages not explicitly measured.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8062/00350196.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"46","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.350196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.350196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metastability in CMOS library elements in reduced supply and technology scaled applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metastasis","Libraries","CMOS technology","Latches","Voltage","Circuits","Frequency synchronization","Testing","Delay effects","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","synchronisation","circuit stability","SPICE","failure analysis","fault diagnosis","logic testing","circuit optimisation","delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS library elements","loading","power supply","technology scaling","metastable parameters","CMOS latches","synchronizers","unbuffered latches","buffered latches","mean time between failure","normalization scheme","channel length","on-chip delays","bistable element","optimization","SPICE parameters","multiplexer","2 mum","1.2 mum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Metastability in CMOS library elements in reduced supply and technology scaled applications","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4871520","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metastability in CMOS library elements in reduced supply and technology scaled applications","sourcePdf":"00350196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044029S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"43","articleId":"350196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":350198,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The major goal of the course was to teach students to experiment and investigate in a systematic way, thus validating knowledge by themselves. This paper reports on the changes introduced and the results obtained. Important features are that difficulties that the students meet in measuring or calculation procedures are distinguished from the basic approach of investigation and practiced in separate assignments, and that the necessary information is complete, concise, general and understandable, but not cookbook-like. Help that students needed from the teaching assistants during the labs diminished considerably, leaving assessment of the logbooks as their main task.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4887625","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of a laboratory course in network analysis: learning to validate knowledge in an experimental way","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of a laboratory course in network analysis: learning to validate knowledge in an experimental way","sourcePdf":"00350216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044988S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"2","articleId":"350216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":350223,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The approach is to model the radiation from the device under test (DUT) as due to an equivalent set of multipoles. Assuming the DUT is electrically small only the initial multipole moments, the electric and magnetic dipole terms, need be retained. A sequence of TEM cell measurements is then used to determine the equivalent DUT dipole moments, The dipole model then allows one to simulate DUT emissions both in free space and over a ground screen. Thus, emission measurements over an open area test site (OATS) as called for by various standards may be simulated. Such measurement schemes have previously been successfully developed for standard two port TEM cells. However, certain broad-band TEM cells are single-port devices; thus, some modification of the previous approach is required. This paper reviews the basics of the multipole model as it relates to TEM cells, details various measurement schemes appropriate to single-port TEM cells, and presents examples of measured emission data, both near field and far field, in all cases considered, the correlation between emission data measured directly over a ground screen and simulated ground screen data based on TEM cell measurements is excellent.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On correlating TEM cell and OATS emission measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/15.350235","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/8064/00350235.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.350235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"On correlating TEM cell and OATS emission measurements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4907243","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On correlating TEM cell and OATS emission measurements","sourcePdf":"00350235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061831S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"127","articleId":"350235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":350242,"authors":[{"name":"B.N.

The same structure is also analyzed using a bilinear transformation expressed in terms of mutually inverse points followed by a logarithmic transformation.

A new and efficient feedback receiver structure is described for coherent demodulation of the K asynchronous CDMA signals. By incorporating adaptive cancellation of the cochannel MU1 in a feedback structure, the new design offers the following advantages: protection of the receiver's synchronization loops as well as its data demodulators against MUI; lower bit error rate (BER) than the conventional receiver for equal-strength as well as near-far MUI; and implementation simplicity close to that of the conventional CDMA receiver.

Furthermore, the time variation of the radio channels leads to degradations of the receiver performance. These degradations can be reduced by applying diversity techniques. Using coherent receiver antenna diversity (CRAD) is especially attractive because only the signal processing at the receiver must be modified. In the present paper, the application of CRAD to the more critical uplink of CDMA mobile radio systems with suboptimum JD techniques is investigated for maximal-ratio combining. The authors study six different suboptimum JD techniques based on decorrelating matched filtering, Gauss-Markov estimation, and minimum mean square error estimation with and without decision feedback. These six suboptimum JD techniques which are well-known for single antenna receivers are extended for the application to CRAD. A main concern of the paper is the determining of the SNR performance of the presented JD techniques for CRAD and the achievable average uncoded bit error probabilities for the transmission over rural area, typical urban and bad urban mobile radio channels are determined.","doi":"10.1109/25.350272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8065/00350272.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.350272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint detection with coherent receiver antenna diversity in CDMA mobile radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350272/","displayDocTitle":"Joint detection with coherent receiver antenna diversity in CDMA mobile radio systems","volume":"44","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint detection with coherent receiver antenna diversity in CDMA mobile radio systems","sourcePdf":"00350272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03348S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"116","articleId":"350272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":350277,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

This demand has led to severe capacity limitations in many areas and spread spectrum techniques are being considered as one means to support these services. It is generally accepted that system control in the future will make use of intelligent processors. In this study we delineate an expert system to be used as an intelligent controller for a cell site working in a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) mobile cellular telecommunications system. An existing AI shell is used for program development and simulation and the results are discussed in terms of the benefits obtained by using an expert system approach in the highly dynamic environment of cellular mobile communications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.350280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/8065/00350280.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.350280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8065","startPage":"146","endPage":"154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An expert system approach for cellular CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An expert system approach for cellular CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4899636","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An expert system approach for cellular CDMA","sourcePdf":"00350280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043772S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","articleId":"350280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":350282,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Shen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Hong Shen Wang","id":"37350787500"},{"name":"N.

Such a channel is referred to as a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC). By partitioning the range of the received signal-to-noise ratio into a finite number of intervals, FSMC models can be constructed for Rayleigh fading channels. A theoretical approach is conducted to show the usefulness of FSMCs compared to that of two-state Gilbert-Elliott channels. The crossover probabilities of the binary symmetric channels associated with its states are calculated. The authors use the second-order statistics of the received SNR to approximate the Markov transition probabilities. The validity and accuracy of the model are confirmed by the state equilibrium equations and computer simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.350282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/8065/00350282.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.350282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-state Markov channel-a useful model for radio communication channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Finite-state Markov channel-a useful model for radio communication channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350282/","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4899638","volume":"44","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-state Markov channel-a useful model for radio communication channels","sourcePdf":"00350282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045328S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1203","articleId":"350282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":350285,"authors":[{"name":"B.D.

Motivated by the results of Divsalar and Simon (see IEEE Trans. Commun., vol.36, p.1004, 1988), and incorporating some recent ideas from Boulle and Belfiore (1992), we develop novel 2-D TCM schemes that attain diversity of order two even for a trellis structure that includes parallel paths with one symbol per edge. An algorithm is described that transforms codes designed for the AWGN channel into codes that achieve significant gains over flat fading channel, while preserving their coding gain over AWGN channel. Their performance is assessed via computer simulation for some representative TCM-QAM schemes under the assumption of uncorrelated fading and perfect channel state information (CSI). Finally, the effects of finite interleaving as well as imperfect CSI on code performance are investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4899641","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Design of trellis coded QAM for flat fading and AWGN channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of trellis coded QAM for flat fading and AWGN channels","sourcePdf":"00350285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045658S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","articleId":"350285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":350303,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

Some methods are coming from nature, where organisms both cooperate and compete for environmental resources. This has led to the design of algorithms which simulate these natural processes. The genetic algorithm (GA) represents one of the most successful approaches. Genetic algorithms are adaptive search methods that simulate natural processes such as: selection, information inheritance, random mutation, and population dynamics. At first, GAs were most applicable to numerical parameter optimizations due to an easy mapping from the problem to representation space. Today they find more and more general applications thanks to: (1) understanding better the necessary properties of the required mapping, and (2) new ways to process problem constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/45.350566","startPage":"31","endPage":"35","publicationTitle":"IEEE Potentials","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/45.350566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8069","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Potentials","pdfPath":"/iel1/45/8069/00350566.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms.

The receiver is fabricated in a 12 GHz f/sub t/ silicon bipolar technology and consists of a differential transimpedance amplifier with an auto-threshold level controller and a high-speed quantizer. Using an InGaAs avalanche photodiode, the typical burst mode sensitivity is around /spl minus/34 dBm (10/sup /spl minus/9/ BER) at bit rates up to 1.5 Gb/s with a dynamic range of 26 db for both pseudorandom and burst signals. The results using a laser beam modulated by a high-speed external modulator indicate that the receiver can be operated at bit rates higher than 2 Gb/s. With a worst-case self-resetting time <50 ns for the threshold control circuit, the receiver is usable for optical packet communication where data signals with varying optical power are employed. This receiver was demonstrated in a 622-Mb/s optical bus application where the clock signal was recovered from the packet data signal using a novel high-speed CMOS instantaneous clock recovery IC.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.350582","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"325","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8070/00350582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.350582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed, burst-mode, packet-capable optical receiver and instantaneous clock recovery for optical bus operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","High speed optical techniques","Optical sensors","Optical modulation","Clocks","Bit rate","Stimulated emission","Silicon","Differential amplifiers","Optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","clocks","integrated optoelectronics","sensitivity","optical receivers","avalanche photodiodes","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed","burst-mode","packet-capable optical receiver","instantaneous clock recovery","optical bus operation","enhanced performance","f/sub t/ Si bipolar technolog","differential transimpedance amplifier","auto-threshold level controller","high-speed quantizer","InGaAs avalanche photodiode","typical burst mode sensitivity","dynamic range","pseudorandom","burst signals","laser beam","high-speed external modulator","worst-case self-resetting time","threshold control circuit","optical packet communication","CMOS instantaneous clock recovery IC","12 GHz","1.5 Gbit/s","2 Gbit/s","622 Mbit/s","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"High-speed, burst-mode, packet-capable optical receiver and instantaneous clock recovery for optical bus operation","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4679065","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350582/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed, burst-mode, packet-capable optical receiver and instantaneous clock recovery for optical bus operation","sourcePdf":"00350582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073052S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"8070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"73","articleId":"350582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":350584,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The possibility of simultaneously supporting other broadband services, such as B-ISDN and traffic information systems (IVHS), enhance the attractiveness of a radio link. A large number of antenna units need to be served due to the limited propagation distances achievable at mm-wave frequencies, and therefore, a low-cost generation and delivery method has to be developed. In this paper, alternatives for the optical generation and distribution of mm-wave signals are reviewed and a new method is proposed that eases the bandwidth, and hence the cost, of the required optoelectronic components. An assessment of the relative merits of the methods is given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8070/00350584.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"375","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.350584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.350584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remote delivery of video services using mm-waves and optics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["B-ISDN","Information systems","Radio link","Antennas and propagation","Optical propagation","Frequency","Optical devices","Signal generators","Bandwidth","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical links","subscriber loops","television networks","video signals","microwave links","B-ISDN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote video service delivery","mm-waves","optics","radio-based final drop","video delivery","spectral availability constraints","mm-wave region","radio spectrum","broadband services","B-ISDN","traffic information systems","IVHS","radio link","antenna units","limited propagation distances","low-cost generation","optical generation","review","optoelectronic components"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Remote delivery of video services using mm-waves and optics","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4679070","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote delivery of video services using mm-waves and optics","sourcePdf":"00350584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035427S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"8070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"126","articleId":"350584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":350586,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These relations, with a slight modification for the signal power, are also found to be valid for in-line amplifier systems, in which each optical amplifier, though adding undesired amplified spontaneous emission, compensates the signal attenuation occurring in the preceding fiber.

It is based on the noise figure concept in conjunction with broadband matching theory. The design is accurate because it directly utilizes the active device noise parameters, such as minimum noise figure, noise resistance, and optimum source impedance, which are readily available at microwave frequencies. The analysis has established the general noise-matching requirements of the tuning network that result in the minimum obtainable equivalent input noise current and the fundamental noise limit in tuned receivers. Synthesis procedures are described that can closely satisfy the general noise-matching requirements, which has led to a new low pass filter-type matching network with ultra-broadband characteristics that also approach the fundamental noise limit.

In particular, it is shown that multiple consecutive failures may have a serious adverse effect on the speed of gigabit optical networks. Results indicate that, with 20 nodes using simple direct-detection, only passive star networks can operate at Gb/s in the event of multiple consecutive faults. Use of optical preamplifiers is shown to remedy this shortcoming substantially: even with 3 consecutive node failures, optical networks with passive star couplers or single couplers can achieve Gb/s transmission speed for a node spacing of up to 2.3 km.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4679055","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Gigabits-per-second optical interconnection networks: fault-tolerance with and without optical amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gigabits-per-second optical interconnection networks: fault-tolerance with and without optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00350598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034749S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"8070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"2","articleId":"350598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":350619,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

This system monitors gas flow rates, RF power, temperature, pressure, and dc bias voltage. A neural network was trained on the monitored data using the feed-forward, error backpropagation algorithm. This network was used to perform three distinct modeling tasks. First, the network was trained on a subset of ten samples of the time series representing a single process run, and subsequently used to forecast the next data point. In the second task, the network was trained as in the first task, but used to predict the next ten values of the data sequence. In each of the first two tasks, the trained network yielded errors of less than 5%. In the final task, a neural net was used to generate a malfunction alarm when the sampled data did not conform to its previously established pattern.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/66.350758","startPage":"62","endPage":"71","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/8075/00350758.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.350758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time series modeling of reactive ion etching using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Etching","Neural networks","Remote monitoring","Plasma temperature","Data acquisition","Workstations","Plasma applications","Fluid flow","Radio frequency","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor process modelling","sputter etching","time series","feedforward neural nets","data acquisition","backpropagation","statistical process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series modeling","reactive ion etching","neural networks","real-time tool data","etch monitoring","data acquisition system","RIE chamber","Plasma Therm Series 700 Dual Chamber etcher","gas flow rates","RF power","dc bias voltage","feedforward error backpropagation algorithm","data sequence","malfunction alarm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350758/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"Time series modeling of reactive ion etching using neural networks","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4900984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time series modeling of reactive ion etching using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00350758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035785S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"37","articleId":"350758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":350774,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

This scheme exploits residual correlation among different layers of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) domain and thereby improves the encoding efficiency by taking advantage of the DWT and TCCVQ, which requires less computational complexity and less storage (memory). In this scheme, DWT coefficients are rearranged to form the small blocks, which are composed of the corresponding coefficients from all subbands. The block matrices, then, are classified and further divided into subvectors depending on the DWT coefficient statistics as this allows efficient distribution of bits.

It can utilize both the information of the local extrema and modulus of transform results to detect corners and arcs effectively. The ramp-width of contour orientation profile, which can be computed using the transformed modulus of two scales, reveals the difference between corner and arc and is utilized in the determination of corner points. The experimental results have shown that the detector is more effective than both the single- and multiple-scale detectors. They also demonstrate that the detector is insensitive to boundary noise. In addition, the proposed method is more efficient than the other multiscale corner detector because it operates on fewer number of scales, which can be implemented by a fast transform algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8078/00350810.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.350810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.350810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale corner detection by using wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Spline","Smoothing methods","Detectors","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform","multiscale corner detection","contour orientation","local extrema","modulus","transform results","arcs","ramp-width","boundary noise","fast transform algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale corner detection by using wavelet transform","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4873207","pubMedId":"18289962","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale corner detection by using wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00350810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036863S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"72","articleId":"350810","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":350814,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Rahgozar","affiliation":["David Ross Fellow at the School of Electncal Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","The Webster Research Cente, Xerox Corporation, Webster, NY, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Rahgozar","id":"38557238500"},{"name":"J.P.

Most motion estimation algorithms operate on image data that has been sampled in both space and time. However, very little work has been done to investigate the impact of the underlying sampling strategy on the motion estimation problem. The authors investigate motion estimation with time-sequentially sampled image data. They consider both centroid-displacement-based and Fourier-based approaches to motion estimation with this type of data. For comparision, they also examine the performance of these estimators with conventional, frame-instantaneously sampled data. The motion estimators are developed and evaluated in the context of the tracking problem. In particular, they present extensive numerical results showing the performance of the motion estimators in a simulated tracking environment within which the assumptions underlying the development of the estimators are violated. These results suggest empirical rules for choosing parameter values for the estimators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4873203","pubMedId":"18289958","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Motion estimation based on time-sequentially sampled imagery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion estimation based on time-sequentially sampled imagery","sourcePdf":"00350814.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052843S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"7","articleId":"350814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":350860,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The GSM system has been designed to evolve, with current standardization work within ETSI addressing a new derivative to service the needs of European railways along with other GSM phase 2+ extensions, such as General Packet Data Service, repeaters, and GSM/DCS roaming, which will keep GSM up to date through to the year 2000 and beyond. But how long can this evolution last? Is GSM the very best possible TDMA-based system? Can it evolve to provide the service needs of third generation mobile? What is the real potential of TDMA techniques? To answer some of these questions, an example TDMA-based radio access system has been developed within the European Advanced TDMA Mobile Access (ATDMA) project, with a specific focus on the terrestrial aspects of the third generation mobile system known in Europe as the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS).

Current reactive systems have integrated planning and learning capabilities to allow them to augment their store of reactive behaviors whenever they are forced to plan. The cycle of evaluation and reaction used by these systems implicitly detects and corrects any errors made in prior behavior execution. By capitalizing on this analogy to error recovery, the authors are able to gain the benefits of a reactive system for use in error recovery while minimizing the perception and evaluation burden that is inherent in those approaches. The authors present a system that uses the new learning reactive paradigm to quickly correct known errors and autonomously learn to recover new errors without human intervention.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350896","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/941/8081/00350896.pdf","startPage":"2915","endPage":"2920 vol.4","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic generation of error recovery knowledge through learned reactivity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Automatic generation of error recovery knowledge through learned reactivity","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4829456","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350896/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic generation of error recovery knowledge through learned reactivity","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00350896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02902S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"10","articleId":"350896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":350900,"authors":[{"name":"K.

However, task constraints may make achieving form-closure impossible or undesirable. In this case, one needs to employ a force-closure grasp. In this paper, we study the subclass of force-closure grasps known as second-order stable grasps, which typically have a small number of contacts. We derive conditions for second-order stability and represent second-order stability cells as conjunctions of equations and inequalities in the configuration variables of the system. These cells are the subsets of the system's configuration space for which the frictionless workpiece is second-order stable. We also determine the minimum and maximum numbers of contacts necessary for second-order stability. Our results are applied to a simple planar whole-arm manipulation system to generate one of its second-order stability cells.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/941/8081/00350912.pdf","startPage":"2815","endPage":"2821 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350912","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350912","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350912","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Fingers","Predictive models","Equations","Friction","Robots","Motion analysis","Orbital robotics","Trajectory","Manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulators","force control","stability","mechanical contact"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second-order stability cells","frictionless rigid body","rigid fingers","force-closure grasp","task constraints","second-order stable grasps","inequalities","configuration variables","configuration space","minimum contacts","planar whole-arm manipulation system","maximum contacts"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350912/","displayDocTitle":"Second-order stability cells of a frictionless rigid body grasped by rigid fingers","accessionNumber":"4829441","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second-order stability cells of a frictionless rigid body grasped by rigid fingers","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00350912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052693S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"17","articleId":"350912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":350914,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Admittance control is used as an explicit force control scheme in which a force setpoint is specified and is tracked by the force compensator. Two adaptive PID and PI force compensators are proposed. The compensators ensure robust tracking of step force setpoints and rejection of constant disturbances. Since the environmental stiffness can typically vary by several orders of magnitude, compensator adaptation is used to ensure a stable and uniform system performance. Dynamic simulation results for a 7 DOF Robotics Research arm are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed admittance control scheme in executing contact tasks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350927","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/941/8081/00350927.pdf","startPage":"2705","endPage":"2712 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive admittance control: an approach to explicit force control in compliant motion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350927/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive admittance control: an approach to explicit force control in compliant motion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4829425","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive admittance control: an approach to explicit force control in compliant motion","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00350927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037204S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"72","articleId":"350927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":350930,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The bending motion, bending direction and bending angle of the MAC have been measured by application of electricity in air and in physiological saline solution. We also modeled this MAC. Experimental results show that the model of the MAC is reasonable for practical applications. By using simulators (conditions similar to a body cavity), we carried out the simulation experiments of \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\".

This approach utilizes a non-contact multi-axis seam tracking (MAST) sensor to track the seams. The MAST sensor measures capacitance variations between the sensor and the workpiece and produces four varying voltages which are read directly into the robot controller. A PID control algorithm which runs at the application program level has been designed based upon a simple dynamic model of the combined robot and sensor plant. The control algorithm acts on the incoming sensor signals in real-time to guide the robot motion along the seam path. Experiments demonstrate that seams can be tracked at 100 mm/sec within the accuracy required for braze paste dispensing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4829403","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Real-time seam tracking for rocket thrust chamber manufacturing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time seam tracking for rocket thrust chamber manufacturing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00350949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056169S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"3","articleId":"350949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":350957,"authors":[{"name":"Shaori Guo","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, Oxford University, Oxford, UK"],"lastName":"Shaori Guo","id":"37068698200"},{"name":"W.

Therefore, local navigation requires no environment model and relies entirely on sensorial data. Commonly used sensors such as ultrasonic ranging devices, are known for their associated problems: specular reflections and crosstalk, essentially. However if sensors are used in an appropriate number and geometric lay-outs, the resulting spatial redundancy offers the possibility of overcoming some of those problems. This paper deals with these problems by means of special perception maps using ultrasound data. A generalised grid serves as the base of maps, and its cells have simply binary values: free or occupied. The relation between the topology of the perception map and the environment is a determinant factor for accurate reasoning. A 3-layer feed-forward neural network is used to perform the mapping between sensorial scans and grid occupancy. It was verified that the neural network handles most of the situations of specular reflections, and gives good perception maps for mid-range distances. Changes in environment, such as obstacles in vehicle's trajectory, have also been detected, which stresses the network's ability to generalise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350959","pdfPath":"/iel2/941/8081/00350959.pdf","startPage":"2193","endPage":"2198 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perception maps for the local navigation of a mobile robot: a neural network approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Perception maps for the local navigation of a mobile robot: a neural network approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4829393","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perception maps for the local navigation of a mobile robot: a neural network approach","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00350959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03809S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"11","articleId":"350959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":350966,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The approach consists of a preprocessing and a planning stage. Preprocessing, which is done only once for a given environment, generates a network of randomly, but properly selected, collision-free configurations (nodes). Planning then connects any given initial and final configurations of the robot to two nodes of the network and computes a path through the network between these two nodes. Experiments show that after paying the preprocessing cost (on the order of hundreds of seconds), planning is extremely fast (on the order of a fraction of a second for many difficult examples involving a 10-DOF robot). The approach is particularly attractive for many-DOF robots which have to perform many successive point-to-point motions in the same environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/941/8081/00350966.pdf","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2145 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=350966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized preprocessing of configuration for fast path planning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Orbital robotics","Robot programming","Computer science","Computer networks","Costs","Motion planning","Workstations","Joining processes","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","path planning","network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast path planning","robots","static environments","collision-free configurations","nodes","point-to-point motions","randomized preprocessing","configuration space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/350966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Randomized preprocessing of configuration for fast path planning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4829385","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized preprocessing of configuration for fast path planning","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00350966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11351S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"65","articleId":"350966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":350977,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Ping Chou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Ching-Ping Chou","id":"37655637000"},{"name":"B.

Here, it is shown how nonholonomic constraints can be exploited to design a controllable n-joint manipulator with only two inputs. Gears subject to nonholonomic constraints are designed to transmit velocities from the inputs to the unactuated joints. The designed nonholonomic manipulator is shown to be completely controllable in the whole configuration space. The system is designed with a triangular structure for which a conversion into chained form is presented. The nonholonomic manipulator can, therefore, be controlled using existing controllers for chained form.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351018/","accessionNumber":"4829119","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of a nonholonomic manipulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a nonholonomic manipulator","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00351018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029112S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"36","articleId":"351018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":351027,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of partially known environments. This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan or terrain map. Existing approaches plan an initial path based on known information and then modify the plan locally or replan the entire path as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors, sacrificing optimality or computational efficiency respectively. This paper introduces a new algorithm, D*, capable of planning paths in unknown, partially known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal, and complete manner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/941/8081/00351061.pdf","startPage":"3310","endPage":"3317 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=351061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal and efficient path planning for partially-known environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Robot sensing systems","Orbital robotics","Mobile robots","Motion planning","Trajectory","State-space methods","Cost function","State estimation","Regions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning","optimisation","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient path planning","optimal path planning","partially-known environments","planning trajectories","mobile robot","exploratory robot","D* algorithm","unknown environments","changing environments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal and efficient path planning for partially-known environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4824407","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal and efficient path planning for partially-known environments","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00351061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022981S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"523","articleId":"351061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":351062,"authors":[{"name":"J.T.

The capacitance-based sensors generate electric fields which can completely encompass the robot arm and detect obstacles as they approach from any direction. The directional obstacle information, gathered by the WHAP sensors together with the sensor geometry and robot configuration is used to scale the commanded joint velocities of the robot. A linearized relationship between the WHAP sensor reading and the distance from the obstacle allows direct transformation of perturbations in WHAP readings to perturbations in joint velocities. The WHAP reading is used to directly reduce the component of the command input velocity along the normal axis of the sensor, allowing graceful reductions in speed as the arm approaches the obstacle. By scaling only the component of the velocity vector in the direction of the nearest obstacles, the control system restricts motion in the direction of obstacles while permitting unconstrained motion in other directions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351062","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/941/8081/00351062.pdf","startPage":"3303","endPage":"3309 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Whole arm obstacle avoidance for teleoperated robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Whole arm obstacle avoidance for teleoperated robots","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4824406","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Whole arm obstacle avoidance for teleoperated robots","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00351062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104554S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"27","articleId":"351062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":351072,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

A general learning algorithm is presented for determining the mapping between robot position and object appearance. The robot is first moved through several displacements with respect to its desired position, and a large set of object images is acquired. This image set is compressed using principal component analysis to obtain a four-dimensional subspace. Variations in object images due to robot displacements are represented as a compact parametrized manifold in the subspace. While positioning or tracking, errors in end-effector coordinates are efficiently computed from a single brightness image using the parametric manifold representation. The learning component enables accurate visual control without any prior hand-eye calibration. Several experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed positioning/tracking approach and its relevance to industrial applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning, positioning, and tracking visual appearance","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351072","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/941/8081/00351072.pdf","startPage":"3237","endPage":"3244 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=351072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Learning, positioning, and tracking visual appearance","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4824396","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning, positioning, and tracking visual appearance","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00351072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05376S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"63","articleId":"351072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":351077,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

The criterion was to minimize the interaction forces and moments between the beam and the end-effectors. It turned out that computation for specifying such a trajectory was complicated since an elliptic integral was involved in the computation. In this study, a circular arc is used as the motion trajectory of the two end-effectors. Since a circular arc is easy to specify, the computation time is greatly reduced. However, the interaction forces and moments become non-minimal. To overcome this problem, a neural network mechanism is proposed to adjust the trajectory in real-time such that the interaction forces and moments are reduced. The residual forces and moments are further minimized by a force feedback control mechanism.

The authors' algorithm discussed in this paper integrates AGV schedules into a heuristic-based scheduling algorithm to achieve the maximum amount of flexibility and optimization for a flexible manufacturing environment. Furthermore in order to allow their system to achieve different optimization goals such as shortest schedules or schedules that require the minimum computation time, the authors' system architecture consists of individual modules of heuristics so that one or any combination of these modules can be used. The authors then discuss how they control the use of these heuristic modules to achieve the best results with some experimental data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351086/","accessionNumber":"4824382","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Integrating AGV schedules in a scheduling system for a flexible manufacturing environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating AGV schedules in a scheduling system for a flexible manufacturing environment","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00351086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033716S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"16","articleId":"351086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":351108,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Systems executing such tasks are characterized by ambiguous right hand sides in the differential equations of motion. Consequently, our approach develops upon ideas from generalized dynamical systems (GDSs), an orthogonalization principle, the Hertz contact model, and model-based adaptive control. The result is an asymptotically stable controller that discontinuously switches among three possible configurations based on the contact situation. The method is used to tune the controller independently for both position and constrained motion as also for reducing contact forces during the process of making contact with the environment. The underlying theory is first described. Then the controller synthesis and proof of its asymptotic stability, based on Lyapunov's method, are presented. The idea is illustrated with a simulation of a simple task.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4824360","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Discontinuous model-based adaptive control for robots executing free and constrained tasks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discontinuous model-based adaptive control for robots executing free and constrained tasks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00351108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059286S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"18","articleId":"351108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":351121,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In these operational modes the robot successfully closed and opened connector plugs (bayonet closure), assembled structures from single parts and captured a free-floating object. Several key technologies have made this space robot technology experiment ROTEX a big success: multisensory gripper technology, local (shared autonomy) sensory feedback control concepts, and the powerful delay-compensating 3D-graphics simulation (predictive simulation) in the telerobotic ground station.

The problem of finding the match is framed within a hypothesize-and-test paradigm and the HGA, with a representation size minimum description length evaluation function, is formulated as the method to search for the match. Unlike most genetic algorithms, the HGA introduced is based on an integer representation with a position based recombination operator. An assignment operator, also used as a reproduction operator, introduces domain-specific constraints and defines the hybrid nature of the algorithm. Results for models and scenes derived from images of occluded and cluttered environments are described. The results show the HGA to be an efficient search technique and the related matching technique to be robust in a variety of cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351160/","accessionNumber":"4824308","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model-based matching using a hybrid genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based matching using a hybrid genetic algorithm","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00351160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047191S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"4","articleId":"351160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":351167,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

In addition, training the operators of these complex robotic systems is time-consuming and costly. In this paper a virtual reality based robotic control system is presented. The virtual reality system provides a means by which operators can operate, and be trained to operate, complex robotic systems in an intuitive, cost-effective way. Operator interaction with the robotic system is at a high, task-oriented, level. Continuous state monitoring prevents illegal robot actions and provides interactive feedback to the operator and real-time training for novice users.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/941/8081/00351289.pdf","startPage":"1428","endPage":"1435 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351289","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351289","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=351289","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual reality","Robot control","Control systems","Virtual environment","Laboratories","Computational modeling","Legged locomotion","State feedback","Real time systems","Management training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual reality","interactive systems","computer based training","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive virtual reality simulation system","robot control","operator training","multiple robots","operator interaction","task-oriented level","continuous state monitoring","interactive feedback","novice users","real-time training"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351289/","displayDocTitle":"An interactive virtual reality simulation system for robot control and operator training","accessionNumber":"4818020","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interactive virtual reality simulation system for robot control and operator training","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00351289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047637S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"17","articleId":"351289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":351296,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

For such applications, kinematically redundant manipulators are inherently more reliable since the additional degrees of freedom (DOF) may compensate for a failed joint. In this work, a redundant manipulator is considered to be fault tolerant with respect to a given task if it is guaranteed to be capable of performing the task after any one of its joints has failed and is locked in place. A method is developed for insuring the failure tolerance of kinematically redundant manipulators with respect to a given critical task. Techniques are developed for analyzing the manipulator's workspace to find regions which are inherently suitable for critical tasks due to their relatively high level of failure tolerance. Then, constraints are imposed on the range of motion of the manipulator to guarantee that a given task is completable regardless of which joint fails. These concepts are illustrated for a PUMA 560 that is used for a three-dimensional positioning task.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4818013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An example of failure tolerant operation of a kinematically redundant manipulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An example of failure tolerant operation of a kinematically redundant manipulator","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00351296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037846S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"12","articleId":"351296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":351315,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Dead reckoning is a popular method, but is not reliable when a robot travels long distances or over an uneven surface because of variations in wheel diameter and wheel slippage. The landmark method, which estimates the current position relative to landmarks, cannot be used in an uncharted environment. The authors propose a new method called \"cooperative positioning with multiple robots\". For cooperative positioning, the authors divide the robots into two groups, A and B. One group, say A, remains stationary and acts as a landmark while group B moves. The moving group B then stops and acts as a landmark for group A. This \"dance\" is repeated until the target robot position are reached. Cooperative positioning has a far lower accumulated positioning error than dead reckoning, and can work in three-dimensions which is not possible with dead reckoning. Also, this method has inherent landmarks and therefore works in uncharted environments. This paper discusses the positioning accuracy of the authors' method with error variances for an example with three mobile robots.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351315/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4817994","conferenceDate":"8-13 May 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative positioning with multiple robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative positioning with multiple robots","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00351315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028444S","chronDate":"8-13 May 1994","isNumber":"8081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"941","citationCount":"135","articleId":"351315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":351360,"authors":[{"name":"P.I.

Demand side energy control also forms an important part in the research programs of many research organisations. Reliable data on energy consumption is therefore imperative for effective research in this field, as well as for the successful implementation of demand side management. Traditional load research instrumentation has involved intrusive techniques that require the installation of sensors on each of the individual components of the total load. A non-intrusive appliance load monitor is proposed in this paper to determine the energy consumption of individual appliances turning on or off or operating under continuously varying load conditions. This monitoring system, which is implemented by network pattern identification technology, is based on detailed analysis of the current and voltage of the total load, as measured at the interface of the power source. The approach has been developed to simplify the collection of energy consumption data by utilities, but also has other applications. It is called nonintrusive to contrast it with previous techniques for gathering appliance data, which require placing sensors on individual appliances, and hence an intrusion onto the energy consumer's properly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/351862/","accessionNumber":"4829491","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using neural networks for non-intrusive monitoring of industrial electrical loads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using neural networks for non-intrusive monitoring of industrial electrical loads","confLoc":"Hamamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"00351862.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028596S","chronDate":"10-12 May 1994","isNumber":"8083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1120","citationCount":"42","articleId":"351862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":351901,"authors":[{"name":"Guo Shize","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Guo Shize","id":"37087332367"},{"name":"Sun Shenghe","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Sun Shenghe","id":"37087356142"},{"name":"Zhang Zhongting","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Zhongting","id":"37087544062"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1880-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"351901","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Oscilloscopes","Clocks","Electronic equipment testing","Costs","Sun","Performance evaluation","Time measurement","Instruments","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital storage oscilloscopes","statistical analysis","waveform analysis","computerised instrumentation","random processes","microcomputer applications","signal processing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent sampling","digital storage oscilloscopes","random equivalent sampling","sequential equivalent sampling","compound equivalent sampling","high efficiency","periodic signal","fast-varying signal","slow-varying signal"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=351901","abstract":"The random equivalent sampling and sequential equivalent sampling are two equivalent sampling methods widely used in the Digital Storage Oscilloscopes.

This scheme was shown to improve the component utilization factor more so than using pipelined architecture at the macro-level. Performance of the scheme was analyzed with respect to the time for processing one frequency output and the number of modules required. Also, a method of the error analysis was investigated to consider the CORDIC-based DFT processor as a prospective engine for a wide range of input bit rates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Band pass filters","Discrete Fourier transforms","Hafnium","Energy measurement","Detectors","Arithmetic","Performance analysis","Frequency","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","band-pass filters","parallel architectures","pipeline processing","error analysis","redundancy","VLSI","systolic arrays","digital radio systems","detector circuits","telecommunications computing","telecommunication network management","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computing architecture","DFT","band-pass filtered energy detection","Discrete Fourier Transform processors","HF band","macro-level","parallel redundant arithmetic architecture","error analysis","CORDIC-based DFT processor","engine","pipelined architectures","micro-level","component utilization factor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=352001","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1994.352001","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings. 10th Anniversary.

The entire mixed signal segment is hampered by the lack of design for testability methodologies and tools. In this field the concept of analog circuit testability is of fundamental importance. The aim of this work is to present a new symbolic approach for testability measurement of analog networks. The new method presents noteworthy advantages from a computational point of view with respect to previous techniques. In fact it does not require the computation of the sensitivities of the network functions but it is based only on the study of the network function symbolic coefficients. The new approach allows also the formulation of simple necessary conditions for maximum testability based only on the order of the network functions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/352094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4805016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new efficient method for analog circuit testability measurement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new efficient method for analog circuit testability measurement","confLoc":"Hamamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"00352094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048476S","chronDate":"10-12 May 1994","isNumber":"8083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1120","citationCount":"25","articleId":"352094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":352104,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The methodologies adopted are described in detail and tested on a complex automatic measurement station for induction motor testing. The performance of the proposed IFDI scheme is experimentally evaluated mainly in terms of correct diagnosis, incorrect fault isolation, missed fault detection, and false alarm.

This feature can result in a sensible reduction of cost in the analysis and control of large structures and could be of great advantage when some of the points under investigation of the structure are not physically accessible. The first step of research is the validation of the ANN approach to a satisfactory analysis of the structure. Previous papers have highlighted the encouraging results obtained from an ANN implementation for the description of a stiffened aluminum panel behaviour. In that case the ANN was trained with data obtained by a validated FEM (Finite Element Method) structural model. In the simulation phase the ANN estimated the behaviour of all the grid points with data referred only to a portion of points with interesting performances in terms of accuracy and computing time. The present paper describes a measurement system in which the ANN is trained with real data, experimentally obtained by accelerometers. The investigation was carried out considering a sinusoidal excitation, typically produced by the rotating engines of turboprob aircrafts. Real data allowed us to rest the ability of the ANN to learn the structural dynamics taking into the right account the influence of noise, not considered in the previous phase of the research. The experimental results highlight again the good ANN behaviour accuracy in the estimation of all the rest points considered for the analysis. The present research is the necessary premise for ANNs based active control applications in aeronautics and aerospace.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/352108/","accessionNumber":"4799746","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Use of artificial neural networks for optimal sensing in complex structures analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of artificial neural networks for optimal sensing in complex structures analysis","confLoc":"Hamamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"00352108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142139S","chronDate":"10-12 May 1994","isNumber":"8083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1120","citationCount":"2","articleId":"352108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":352109,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, in practice, nonuniform sampling occurs in many data acquisition systems due to imperfect sampling timebase, and errors it introduces are sometimes dominating and can not be ignored. In this paper, we investigate the problem of measuring the average power from data samples obtained by nonuniformly sampling a continuous time signal. The relationship between the discrete time expression of the total energy and the continuous time expression is obtained in closed form. The result is applied to the estimation of the average power of sinusoidal signals. It is shown that a simple averaging formula can be used to estimate the average power even with nonuniformly sampled sinusoidal signals if two times of the signal frequency is not an integer multiple of the sampling frequency divided by the sampling offset period, M. It is further demonstrated that a simple averaging method can be used to obtain an accurate estimation even if the frequency condition is not met. Simulations agree with the theoretical predictions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1994.352170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.1994.352170","startPage":"1451","endPage":"1454 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings. 10th Anniversary.
