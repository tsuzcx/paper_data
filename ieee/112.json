The optimal solution point in the vector space was found by the use of a \"pattern search\" routine which utilized randomly chosen orthogonal transformations of the search pattern to minimize an objective function.

A common feature that most known analytic solutions share is an assumption that the fundamental mode of propagation resembles a TEM wave closely enough to permit various electrostatic approximations such as conformal mapping, relaxation method, and variational principle. Such solutions although quite useful at low frequencies neglect the fact that the actual propagating modes cannot be TEM. The dispersion of non-TEM waves causes, at microwave frequencies, considerable deviations in effective dielectric constant and velocity of propagation from those values obtained by the electrostatic approximation. In this paper it is shown that the modes that exist on a microstrip transmission line must be hybrid in order that all boundary and continuity conditions be satisfied. In this rigorous analysis the hybrid modes are decomposed into sums of TE and TM (or LSE and LSM) space harmonics, each satisfying the wave equation and the external boundary conditions and their total satisfying the continuity conditions and boundary conditions on the strip. The final outcome of the analysis is a pair of coupled integral equations that are solved numerically. The results indicate that the fundamental hybrid mode is propagating at all frequencies and approaches the known static solutions at low frequencies. However, the correct solution deviates from the static approximation at microwave frequencies. Of particular interest is the fact that as the dielectric constant of the substrate increases the frequency range at which the TEM approximation is valid decreases. The results obtained show close agreement with available experimental data.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMTT.1969.1122648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24828","publicationTitle":"1969 G-MTT International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"1969 G-MTT International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel6/5470337/24828/01122648.pdf","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wave Propagation in Microstrip Transmission Lines","doi":"10.1109/GMTT.1969.1122648","startPage":"3","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1122648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 1969","displayDocTitle":"Wave Propagation in Microstrip Transmission Lines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1122648/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","publicationDate":"1969","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 1969","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wave Propagation in Microstrip Transmission Lines","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01122648.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028221S","chronDate":"5-7 May 1969","isNumber":"24828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5470337","citationCount":"43","articleId":"1122648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1122649,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper the design principle and experimental results of a multistage transistor amplifier of simple construction are described. In this amplifier, n unit amplifiers of the same design are connected in cascade. Short transmission lines are inserted between each amplifiers.

In this medium, conductors are photoetched on one side of a dielectric card supported approximately halfway between two parallel ground planes. Usually a large number of thin film circuits are supported on a single card and are therefore coupled. The parameters needed to characterize coupled microwave structures are the surge impedances and phase velocities of the normal modes. For lumped circuits, or combinations of lumped circuits and distributed structures, which are quite common, the parasitic capacitances between adjacent conductors and the capacitances to ground are required. All these parameters can be found from the odd and even mode static capacitances for two parallel coupled lines. The transmission medium is inhomogeneous (the dielectric medium that supports the conductors is suspended in air as seen in Figure 1) so that not only are the system capacitances required with dielectrics present, but also required are these capacitances with all dielectrics removed. From this last, homogeneous, case the line inductance in an assumed TEM mode is found. The methods of calculation outlined here of the even and odd mode capacitances for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases are based on a variational approximation and on several conformal transformations. Their use at an interactive time share terminal has proven very valuable in the design of low loss, high performance microwave circuits.","displayPublicationTitle":"1969 G-MTT International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel6/5470337/24828/01122711.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"328","publicationTitle":"1969 G-MTT International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/GMTT.1969.1122711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMTT.1969.1122711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24828","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1122711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Even and Odd Mode Capacitance Parameters for Coupled Lines in Suspended Substrate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coupling circuits","Dielectric substrates","Conductors","Parasitic capacitance","Dielectric thin films","Thin film circuits","Surges","Impedance","Inductance","Performance loss"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1122711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 1969","displayDocTitle":"The Even and Odd Mode Capacitance Parameters for Coupled Lines in Suspended Substrate","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1969","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 1969","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Even and Odd Mode Capacitance Parameters for Coupled Lines in Suspended Substrate","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01122711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024027S","chronDate":"5-7 May 1969","isNumber":"24828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5470337","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1122711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1122731,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

At this laboratory they have been used in various circuits such as filters, quadrature hybrids, and impedance matching networks for high-power transistor amplifiers. Limiting the use of lumped elements has been: (1) the uncertainties of the reactance and Q's of the elements at frequencies above 2.5 GHz, and (2) the difficulty of fabricating the high-Q components necessary for large impedance transformations to low-impedance active devices. The past difficulty in measuring the reactance and Q values above S-band has been the unavailability of a measurement system at high frequencies that is compatible with the size of the element. However, suitable resonant techniques have now been developed for frequencies from 1 to 12 GHZ. Lumped inductors and capacitors fabricated at this Iaboratory have been measured by these new techniques. The results demonstrate that high-Q capacitors have been achieved by recent improvements in thin-film dielectric processing, and that capacitors and single-turn inductors are \"truly lumped\" through 10 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/GMTT.1970.1122757","publicationTitle":"G-MTT 1970 International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"G-MTT 1970 International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel6/5470338/24829/01122757.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMTT.1970.1122757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lumped-Elements in Microwave Integrated Circuits in the 1-12 GHZ Range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1122757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 1970","displayDocTitle":"Lumped-Elements in Microwave Integrated Circuits in the 1-12 GHZ Range","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1970","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 1970","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lumped-Elements in Microwave Integrated Circuits in the 1-12 GHZ Range","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01122757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.017276S","chronDate":"11-14 May 1970","isNumber":"24829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5470338","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1122757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1122760,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The results only apply to filters with 50 /spl Omega/ impedance on 99.5% alumina substrates, but they can easily be generalized to other impedances.","doi":"10.1109/GMTT.1970.1122760","publicationTitle":"G-MTT 1970 International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"G-MTT 1970 International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel6/5470338/24829/01122760.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMTT.1970.1122760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel Coupled Microstrip Filter Design Procedure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1122760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1122760/","displayDocTitle":"A Parallel Coupled Microstrip Filter Design Procedure","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1970","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 1970","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel Coupled Microstrip Filter Design Procedure","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01122760.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03726S","chronDate":"11-14 May 1970","isNumber":"24829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5470338","citationCount":"14","articleId":"1122760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1122761,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the frequency domain they considered both reciprocal and nonreciprocal lumped, linear and time invariant elements.

These data are typical and not essentially different from the early data presented by Josenhans. Most differences in the FM noise can be explained by the changes in circuit Q with great reduction in the FM noise obtained only by increasing the circuit Q by energy storage in an additional stabilizing cavity. Differences in AM data can usually be accounted for by the bias circuit impedance or by threshold problems in the AM noise measurement equipment. This is particularly true for the Gunn diode oscillator because the AM noise is low enough that only a Schottky barrier diode is capable of making the measurement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1122796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 1970","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 1970","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","publicationDate":"1970","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Noise Properties and Stabilization of Gunn and Avalanche Diode Oscillators and Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Properties and Stabilization of Gunn and Avalanche Diode Oscillators and Amplifiers","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01122796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031859S","chronDate":"11-14 May 1970","isNumber":"24829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5470338","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1122796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1122803,"authors":[{"name":"F.C. de Ronde","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, N.

For a packaged 1\u03bc GaAs FET, a 4-8 GHz band amplifier has been designed with a gain of 7.2 dB + 0.2 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1123284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1975","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1975","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","publicationDate":"1975","accessionNumber":"12423280","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Octave-Band GaAs FET Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Octave-Band GaAs FET Amplifiers","confLoc":"Palo Alto, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01123284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033004S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1975","isNumber":"24834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5473947","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1123284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1123294,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

For power inputs less than -10 dBm, the agreement obtained between measured and predicted IM/sub 3/ is within 3-dB over an amplifier bandwidth of 400 MHz.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intermodulation distortion","MESFETs","Microwave amplifiers","Voltage","Scattering parameters","Frequency measurement","Fixtures","Capacitance","Microwave circuits","Bandwidth"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1979.1124083","publicationTitle":"1979 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1979 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel6/5473951/24839/01124083.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1979.1124083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intermodulation Distortion in Microwave MESFET Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1124083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intermodulation Distortion in Microwave MESFET Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1124083/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1979","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 1979","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 1979-May 2 1979","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intermodulation Distortion in Microwave MESFET Amplifiers","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01124083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029756S","chronDate":"April 30 1979-May 2 1979","isNumber":"24839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5473951","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1124083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1124111,"authors":[{"name":"S.

If the parameters of the medium cannot respond to changes in the electric and magnetic fields of the propagating wave, the fields within such media will be linear. Maxwell's equations are solved for cases in which the scalar permittivity and permeability vary independently with time. When the impedance is constant, an exact solution is obtained. When the impedance varies, a closed form approximation is found since an exact solution is not always possible. The field energy and electromagnetic momentum are derived for a velocity transient and it is seen that, in general, the energy changes and the momentum remains constant. The frequency deviation that results when a monochromatic wave is passed through a section of dielectric with nonconstant velocity of propagation is discussed in detail. An approximate solution is obtained for the case in which the electrical length of such a section is small; it is found that essentially linear phase modulation occurs. The general solution is found for the case in wtilch the electrical length of section is long and the permittivity of the medium sinusoidally modulated. The optimum length found to give the greatest frequency deviation is shown to be generally impracticable. It appears that ferroelectric or ferrimagnetic velocity-modulated dielectrics are feasible, at least for low-power modulators.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24842","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/4547924/24842/01124533.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1958.1124533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1958.1124533","startPage":"167","endPage":"172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Velocity Modulation of Electromagnetic Waves","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1958","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1958","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1124533/","displayDocTitle":"Velocity Modulation of Electromagnetic Waves","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1958","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Velocity Modulation of Electromagnetic Waves","sourcePdf":"01124533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029805S","chronDate":"April  1958","isNumber":"24842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547924","citationCount":"167","articleId":"1124533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1124535,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The design differs from the usual end-coupled strip configuration in that successive strips are parallel coupled along a distance of a quarter-wavelength. The resulting coupling between resonators is partly electric and partly magnetic. Several important advantages are gained by this arrangement: 1) the length of the filter is approximately half that of the end-coupled type; 2) the gaps are larger and therefore less critical; and 3) the insertion-Ioss curve is symmetrical on a frequency scale with the first spurious response occurring at three times the center frequency of the pass band. Formulas are derived for the parallel-coupled-resonator transmission-line filter that permit accurate design for Tchebycheff, maximally flat, or any other physically realizable response. The formulas are theoretically exact in the limit of zero bandwidth, but frequency-response calculations show them to give good results for band widths up to about 30 per cent. An experimental strip-line filter of this type has been constructed, and the data given in this paper show that excellent performance has been obtained.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24842","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/4547924/24842/01124542.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1958.1124542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1958.1124542","startPage":"223","endPage":"231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel-Coupled Transmission-Line-Resonator Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1958","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1958","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1124542/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel-Coupled Transmission-Line-Resonator Filters","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1958","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel-Coupled Transmission-Line-Resonator Filters","sourcePdf":"01124542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028626S","chronDate":"April  1958","isNumber":"24842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547924","citationCount":"420","articleId":"1124542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1124543,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

A convenient method of adjusting the auxiliary tuners is described, sources of error are discussed, and an example is given of the calculation of error limits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1124587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1959","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1959","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1959","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Reflectometer Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Reflectometer Techniques","sourcePdf":"01124587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021929S","chronDate":"July  1959","isNumber":"24844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547924","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1124587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1124628,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Typical circulators differ from ideal circulators in that the forward loss between ports is not zero, and the reverse isolation between ports is not intinite. The main effects of nonintinite isolation are shown to be a modified gain-bandwidth product and a assumed to exist between ports 3 and 2. No other dechange in output admittance of the circulator output port. These effects result principally from the finite isolation between the output and amplifier ports. The main effect of incidental dissipation has previously been shown to be an increase in system noise figure. This paper considers only the effects caused by noninfinite isolation. A model of a lossless three-port circulator with noninfinite isolation is set up, and a negative conductance amplifier is considered to be limited to ensure a positive output conductance at the output port of the circulator (that is, the combination of negative conductance amplifier and nonideal circulator is assumed to be open-circuit stable). Subject to this assumption, the combination of negative conductance amplifier and nonideal circulator is then analyzed for its output admittance, available power gain, and effective input noise temperature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1124695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1959","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1959","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1959","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a Negative Conductance Amplifier Operated with a Nonideal Circulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a Negative Conductance Amplifier Operated with a Nonideal Circulator","sourcePdf":"01124695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053468S","chronDate":"April  1959","isNumber":"24847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547924","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1124695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1124736,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.

This method is applicable for filter designs ranging from narrow to very wide bandwidths (2 to 1 or more). The desired insertion loss characteristic is obtained by use of a lumped-element, Tchebycheff, or maximally flat (or other) low-pass prototype. With the aid of the concept of impedance inverters, the prototype is converted into a cascade of symmetrical (but differing) sections. The image properties of symmetrical sections of the band-pass microwave filter structure are then related to those of corresponding sections of the prototype. Straightforward design equations are given for filters using short-circuited or open-circuited stubs, and also for filters using parallel-coupled lines. Mapping functions are derived that permit accurate prediction of the microwave filter cutoff characteristic from that of the prototype. The responses of a number of filter designs were computed, and a Tchebycheff filter with a 2.2 to 1 band-width was built and tested. The reponses of all of the filter designs were in close agreement with the prescribed characteristics, and the accuracy of the mapping functions was verified.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1960.1124801","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/4547924/24851/01124801.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1960.1124801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24851","startPage":"580","endPage":"593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Wide-Band (and Narrow-Band) Band-Pass Microwave Filters on the Insertion Loss Basis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1124801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Wide-Band (and Narrow-Band) Band-Pass Microwave Filters on the Insertion Loss Basis","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1960","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1124801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1960","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"November 1960","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Wide-Band (and Narrow-Band) Band-Pass Microwave Filters on the Insertion Loss Basis","sourcePdf":"01124801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034004S","chronDate":"November  1960","isNumber":"24851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547924","citationCount":"65","articleId":"1124801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1124809,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

The method makes the standard assumption that the current distribution is that of a lossless line and the surface resistivity that of an infinite-plane condutor. Although this method applies accurately to most other types of lines, in this case an error of the order of 10% is believed to occur due to the failure of the assumptions at the corners of the strip. However, the error is in a direction that makes the computed values conservative, and the accuracy should be sufficient for most practical purposes. The derivation of a correction term is now being attempted. In addition to the discussion of attenuation attention is given in this paper to the design considerations involved in a shielded-strip-line impedance meter, and to some preliminary data obtained with this device. Also the future topics for investigation under this research and development program are mentioned.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24858","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/4547924/24858/01124922.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1955.1124922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1955.1124922","startPage":"119","endPage":"126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Problems in Strip Transmission Lines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1955","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1955","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1124922/","displayDocTitle":"Problems in Strip Transmission Lines","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1955","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Problems in Strip Transmission Lines","sourcePdf":"01124922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027934S","chronDate":"March  1955","isNumber":"24858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547924","citationCount":"136","articleId":"1124922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1124924,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The phase shifting sections maybe designed for low voltage standing-wave ratio (vswr) over a considerable bandwidth. When a square waveguide capable of supporting two fundamental modes is loaded periodically, the irises act inductively for one mode and capacitively for the other, thus introducing a differential phase shift. This differential phase shift may be made equal to 90\u00b0, in order to convert linear to circular polarization. Furthermore such a device may be made, by proper choice of parameters, to yield near-circular polarization over a bandwidth of 1.65:1, because the variation in phase delay for one mode and phase advance for the other tend to compensate each other as the frequency is varied. Several of these circular polarizers have been built and tested at X band and the measured results of ellipticity and vswr, as well as broad-band performance check with theoretical values quite closely.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24862","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/4547924/24862/01124986.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1955.1124986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1955.1124986","startPage":"18","endPage":"21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Shift by Periodic Loading of Waveguide and Its Application to Broad-Band Circular Polarization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1955","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1955","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1124986/","displayDocTitle":"Phase Shift by Periodic Loading of Waveguide and Its Application to Broad-Band Circular Polarization","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"December 1955","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Shift by Periodic Loading of Waveguide and Its Application to Broad-Band Circular Polarization","sourcePdf":"01124986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03341S","chronDate":"December  1955","isNumber":"24862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547924","citationCount":"45","articleId":"1124986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1124990,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Meyer","affiliation":["Laboratory for Electronics, Inc., Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Meyer","id":"38227367200"},{"name":"H.B.

Two basic types are treated in detail; the simplest is one-quarter wavelength long at the center of its frequency band, while the other is three-quarter wavelength long. The quarter-wavelength type can be used over an octave of frequencies with approximately consistant coupling, while the three-quarter-wavelength type can be used equally well over more than two two octaves. For example, a -3-db coupler of the first type has a variation of +-0.3 db over a 2:1 band, while the second type has the same variation over a 4.5:1 band. Theoretically both types should have infinite directivity at all frequencies. The experimental results for models of these directional couplers have been found to conform very closely to the theoretical coupling functions, while the directivity, although usually good, is limited by discontinuity effects and constructional tolerances.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1958.1125214","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/4547924/24872/01125214.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1958.1125214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled-Transmission-Line Directional Couplers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1125214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1958","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1958","displayDocTitle":"Coupled-Transmission-Line Directional Couplers","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1958","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled-Transmission-Line Directional Couplers","sourcePdf":"01125214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018703S","chronDate":"October  1958","isNumber":"24872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547924","citationCount":"43","articleId":"1125214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1125239,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0097-2002"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-088X"}],"articleNumber":"1125239","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1832},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1125239","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Printed circuits","Impedance matching","Spirals","Power transmission lines","Transmission line theory","Distributed parameter circuits","Frequency","Equivalent circuits","Microwave devices","Azimuth"]}],"abstract":"A novel printed circuit balun is described which is particularly well suited to applications where space is at a premium.

In the cases of nondegenerate parametric amplifiers and up-converters, the fact that the diode must be brought to resonance at more than one frequency has an added limiting effect on bandwidth.

The physics of the diodes are reviewed together with some of the characteristics and equivalent circuit parameters. The diodes are then considered as mixer diodes with IF in the audio range and also the standard 30-Mc IF. Another promising application considered is the use of the backward diodes in low-level detection. The results show that the noise figure at 13.5 kMc with a 1-kc IF is around 15 db better than any commercially available mixer diodes. Using 30-Mc IF, the noise figure of backward diode mixers is without special optimum design, comparable to the best mixer diodes on the market. Of great importance, especially in micro-miniaturization, is the fact that these diodes may be used with a very low local oscillator power (50 \u00b5w or less). The high nonlinearity of the I-V characteristic at the origin and the low 1/f noise properties of these diodes are also of benefit in crystal video receivers and other low-level detector applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1125363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1961","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1961","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1961","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Low-Noise Properties of Microwave Backward Diodes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Noise Properties of Microwave Backward Diodes","sourcePdf":"01125363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020741S","chronDate":"September  1961","isNumber":"24878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547924","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1125363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1125385,"authors":[{"name":"C.Y.

Synchronization is dependent upon oscillator circuit parameters, the ratio of injected power to oscillator power, and frequency difference between the free-running oscillator and the injection signal. Locking has been observed with injection signals 70 db below the oscillator output and 30-db ratios have been demonstrated to be easily realizable. Injection locking may be considered a form of amplification that permits taking advantage of the fact that microwave oscillators are smafler, lighter, less expensive and more efficient than amplifier devices. The low-frequency theory of Adler is shown to describe accurately the locking phenomena in reflex klystron oscillators and the transient response is extended to determine limitations on the amplification of modulated signals. Experimental verification of the theory is shown for 180/spl deg/ phase modulation of the locking signal at rates up to 100 kc for a VA-201 klystron.

At frequencies above 100 Mc, the diode ceases to be a rectifier because of carrier storage and transit time effects. Its shunt capacitance is quite small because of the separation of the P and N regions by the I layer. Conductivity of the I region can be varied by a dc bias current and the device becomes an electrically variable resistor which can be used for microwave attenuators and modulators up to frequencies as high as 20 Gc. The PIN junctions are mounted on posts which are inserted in a 50-ohm strip transmission line as shunt elements, and a number of these elements, spaced a quarter wavelength apart at midband, are used to form an attenuator. At the appropriate bias current, yielding 50-ohm junction resistances, the diode elements are reactively compensated by choice of post dimensions so that they are effectively pure resistances, yielding an image attenuation of 4.2 db per element. Many elements can be used to attain any desired total attenuation and higher impedance end elements can be used to improve the SWR. Bandwidths of 4 to 1 with low SWR in both ON and OFF conditions are achievable. Maximum attenuation of 60 db, insertion loss of 1 db, and SWR of 1.5 are typical for a 12-diode attenuator and powers of the order of watts can be handled with negligible harmonic generation. When used as a pulse modulator, rise times of the order of 10 nsec are achievable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1125506/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1962","publicationDate":"July 1962","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"10","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Variable Attenuators and Modulators Using PIN Diodes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Variable Attenuators and Modulators Using PIN Diodes","sourcePdf":"01125506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070373S","chronDate":"July  1962","isNumber":"24884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547924","citationCount":"30","articleId":"1125506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1125556,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

Next, it provides a technique for relating the characteristics of any actual narrow-band, negative-resistance device to the value of the prototype susceptive element adjacent to the negative resistance. When an actual negative-resistance device has been related to a prototype in this manner, the performance of the device with one, two or three additional cascaded resonators can be predicted from given graphs. This allows trade-offs among gain, ripple, and bandwidth, within limits. Finally, the predicted performance can be used with simple formulas and the table of prototype element values to design suitable resonators to broadband the actual amplifier. The tables and techniques of this paper are used successfully to broadband tunnel-diode, maser and parametric-amplifier circuits.

These equivalent circuits often allow simplification of the physicrd circuitry and realization of both broad and narrow bandwidths. The problem of practical circuit configurations is discussed from the viewpoint of bandwidth and circuit element values. Neglecting multiple responses, TEM low-pass, high-pass and band-pass butterworth filters are shown to offer steeper bandedge characteristics than those of corresponding lumped element filters. The use of complementary filters to match a source and load over a wide frequency range is outlined and TEM realizations of these complements are obtained. A simple procedure for obtaining element values of butterworth complements is described. An analysis of parallel coupled filters is made and a simplified equivalent circuit is obtained.

The rotating modes, which are split by the applied magnetic field, form a stationary pattern which can be rotated in space to isolate one of the ports of the circulator. A detailed field theory of the strip-line Y-junction circulator operating with n = 1 is presented. Experiments designed to confirm the validity of the rotating normal mode description of circulator action in the Y-junction circulator also are presented; these include measurements of mode frequencies and electric field patterns. The results of the field theory are used in a design procedure for quarter-wave coupled strip-line circulators. The results of the design procedure are shown to compare adequately with experimental circulators. Higher mode operation of strip-line circulators is described. The operation of waveguide cavity circulators is shown to depend on the rotating ferrite-loaded cavity modes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operation of the Ferrite Junction Circulator","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1965.1125923","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24899/01125923.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1965.1125923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1125923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1125923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1965","displayDocTitle":"Operation of the Ferrite Junction Circulator","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"January 1965","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation of the Ferrite Junction Circulator","sourcePdf":"01125923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032734S","chronDate":"Jan 1965","isNumber":"24899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"293","articleId":"1125923","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1125934,"authors":[{"name":"L.I.

The square of the magnitude of these waves is directly related to the exchangeable power of a source and the reflected power. For this reason, in this paper, they are called the power waves. For certain applications where the power relations are of main concern, the power waves are more suitable quantities than the conventional traveling waves. The lossless and reciprocal conditions as well as the frequency characteristics of the scattering matrix are presented. Then, the formula is given for a new scattering matrix when the Z/sub i/'s are changed. As an application, the condition under which an amplifier can be matched simultaneously at both input and output ports as well as the condition for the network to be unconditionally stable are given in terms of the scattering matrix components. Also a brief comparison is made between the traveling waves and the power waves.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1965.1125964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24900/01125964.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1965.1125964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Waves and the Scattering Matrix","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1125964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1965","displayDocTitle":"Power Waves and the Scattering Matrix","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1125964/","publicationDate":"March 1965","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1965","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Waves and the Scattering Matrix","sourcePdf":"01125964.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019551S","chronDate":"Mar 1965","isNumber":"24900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"561","articleId":"1125964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1125977,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Yuet Yee","lastName":"Hung Yuet Yee","id":"37087216722"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"1125977","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":742},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Permittivity","Magnetic fields","Equations","Microwave theory and techniques","Dielectric losses","Shape","Magnetic resonance","Electromagnetic fields","Boundary conditions"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Natural Resonant Frequencies of Microwave Dielectric Resonators (Correspondence)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1125977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24900/01125977.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/01125977.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1965.1125977","startPage":"256","endPage":"256","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1965.1125977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1125977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1965","displayDocTitle":"Natural Resonant Frequencies of Microwave Dielectric Resonators (Correspondence)","volume":"13","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1965","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural Resonant Frequencies of Microwave Dielectric Resonators (Correspondence)","sourcePdf":"01125977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030162S","chronDate":"Mar 1965","isNumber":"24900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"41","articleId":"1125977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":1125992,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

The theory is applicable to all microwave filter forms consisting entirely of a cascade of quarter-wave lines, quarter-wave stubs, and coupled quarter-wave lines. The exact design of many conventional filter forms that heretofore could only be designed using approximate methods is possible using the techniques and functions described. General approximating functions that give the \"best\" transmission response in a Butterworth or Chebyshev sense are derived. The use of a maximum number of available singularities to augment the filter skirt response leads to a minimum element filter termed \"optimum multiple.\" An optimum multipole design insures the \"best\" possible response for the minimum element and all corresponding redundant element networks. The designer has the freedom of introducing sufficient redundancy to obtain a design that is practical to construct, but which still realizes the optimum response. Judicious choice of network form often results in improved performance and reduced size in comparison with many conventional filter forms. Design procedures are presented that allow the practical realization of distributed filter networks in the form of quarter-wave lines. A design example and experimental results are given to confirm the theory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Theory and Design of Optimum Quarter-Wave TEM Filters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1965.1125996","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24901/01125996.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1965.1125996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24901","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1125996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1125996/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1965","displayDocTitle":"General Theory and Design of Optimum Quarter-Wave TEM Filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"May 1965","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Theory and Design of Optimum Quarter-Wave TEM Filters","sourcePdf":"01125996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037862S","chronDate":"May 1965","isNumber":"24901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"114","articleId":"1125996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1126002,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

It has been shown by Fourier analysis that three is the minimum number of phase steps required to achieve frequency translation with suppression of the carrier and first symmetrical sideband. A tunable device using microwave switching diodes in a single port Y junction is described. The diodes progressively switch three lenths of waveguide into the circuit establishing three phase steps. A ferrite circulator is used to create a two port device and a modulator supplies proper diode biases and switching logic. Carrier suppression of greater than 30 dB and first symmetrical sideband suppression of greater than 20 dB was observed; other sideband amplitudes are predictable. A conversion efficiency of -6 dB including the circulator loss was measured and the bandwidth for 20 dB carrier suppression varies from almost one per cent to three per cent, depending on other suppression criteria.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1965.1126002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1965.1126002","startPage":"371","endPage":"378","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24901/01126002.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Frequency Translator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1965","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Frequency Translator","publicationDate":"May 1965","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126002/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Frequency Translator","sourcePdf":"01126002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016938S","chronDate":"May 1965","isNumber":"24901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"41","articleId":"1126002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1126050,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

This balun is analyzed here and the parameters which determine its bandwidths are discussed. Curves are presented which allow the design of a balun having any bandwidth. The practical considerations which preclude realization of infinite bandwidths are pointed out. Since the balun is one-quarter wavelength long at center frequency, the balun can be less than one-twentieth wavelength at its lowest operating frequency. Because impedance transformation is generally required with balanced-to-unbalanced line transformation, two techniques including impedance transformation are discused. The reactance slope of the compensated balun is controllable, which allows the balun to directly compensate for the reactance slope of some loads. An example of the compensation of a dipole antenna over a 17-percent bandwidth is discussed. Finally, experimental verification of the balun theory is presented, along with an application to an S-band impedance-transforming compensated balun.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1966","volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1966","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Compensated Balun","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Compensated Balun","sourcePdf":"01126188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026447S","chronDate":"Mar 1966","isNumber":"24907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"90","articleId":"1126188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1126254,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

In particular, gain bandwidth limitations are derived which are imposed by both the inherent resonance associated with the nonreciprocal circulator junction and the reactive parasitic associated with the active device. These limitations are generally more restrictive than past results which assumed a \"perfect\" frequency-independent circulator and took into account only the device parasitic. In addition, a synthesis procedure is presented for realization of an absolutely stable amplifier with a prescribed nth-order Butterworth or Chebyscheff approximation to an ideally flat band-pass power gain characteristic. The approach employed is based upon the theory of reflection coefficient equalization between two reactively constrained resistances representing the pass band circulator and device immittance models. In addition, a band rejection out-of-band stabilizing network is absorbed in the pass band equalizer in accordance with an over-all synthesis procedure. Finally, the theory is verified by the construction and testing of an L-band tunnel diode amplifier having third-order maximally flat power gain centered at 1.46 Gc/s and with half-power bandwidths (430 Mcls and 355 Mc/s at 10 dB and 16dB midband gain) within six percent of those predicted by theory.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1966.1126265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24911/01126265.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"337","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1966.1126265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of Negative Resistance Reflection Amplifiers, Employing Band-Limited Circulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1966","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Negative Resistance Reflection Amplifiers, Employing Band-Limited Circulators","volume":"14","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1966","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126265/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Negative Resistance Reflection Amplifiers, Employing Band-Limited Circulators","sourcePdf":"01126265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03143S","chronDate":"Jul 1966","isNumber":"24911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1126265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1126266,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

Unlike conventional directional couplers, nonsymmetrical directional couplers use coupled lines of unequal characteristic impedances. The principal difference between the performance of nonsymmetrical directional couplers and that of conventional designs is the impedance level of the coupled waves, which may be changed to higher or lower impedance levels than that of the incident wave. These directional couplers may be designed to have infinite directivity and to be matched at all frequencies, or they may be designed to have infinite directivity at all frequencies and a specified maximum VSWR. Coupling relationships and design equations for both cases are presented, and the relative properties of both cases are discussed. The theoretical limitation on the maximum coupling and the maximum impedance transformation that can be obtained simultaneously are derived. Techniques for broadbanding by cascading additional sections of coupled limes are described. Experimental results of a trial --10-dB coupler with coupled lines of 50 and 75 ohms are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled-Transmission-Line Directional Couplers with Coupled Lines of Unequal Characteristic Impedances","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1966.1126266","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24911/01126266.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1966.1126266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1126266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126266/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1966","displayDocTitle":"Coupled-Transmission-Line Directional Couplers with Coupled Lines of Unequal Characteristic Impedances","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"July 1966","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled-Transmission-Line Directional Couplers with Coupled Lines of Unequal Characteristic Impedances","sourcePdf":"01126266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07935S","chronDate":"Jul 1966","isNumber":"24911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"91","articleId":"1126266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1126277,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

The device is basically a two-diode sampler located at the center of a dielectric filled, biconical cavity containing the RF transmission line. The RF line is perpendicular to the axis of the biconical cavity. The sampling pulse is introduced into the cavity by applying it directly between the centers of the opposite faces of the cavity. This establishes a potential difference between two points on the ground conductor of the RF transmission line being sampled. This technique is basic to the operation of the device and plays a key role in the reduction of sampling loop inductance, which would limit the bandwidth. The equivalent circuits are presented along with the appropriate defining equations. The relationship between bandwidth, input VSWR, and step response overshoot, are presented, along with the typical measured results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Oscilloscopes","Radio frequency","Bandwidth","Wideband","Dielectric devices","Transmission lines","Conductors","Distributed parameter circuits","Inductance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1966.1126342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24916/01126342.pdf","startPage":"629","endPage":"635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1966.1126342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling for Oscilloscopes and Other RF Systems: Dc Through X-Band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1126342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling for Oscilloscopes and Other RF Systems: Dc Through X-Band","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126342/","volume":"14","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 1966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1966","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling for Oscilloscopes and Other RF Systems: Dc Through X-Band","sourcePdf":"01126342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020612S","chronDate":"December  1966","isNumber":"24916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"22","articleId":"1126342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":1126363,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

These expressions are then applied to examine the properties of an amplifier having two idlers. The conditions required for minimum noise performance are derived, and it is found that high pump frequencies and external resistive loading of one idler are required. When the two-idler amplifier is compared to a conventional single-idler amplifier under those conditions which permit operation of the same diode at the same signal and pump frequencies, it is found that an improvement in noise figure results. However, the single idler amplifier pumped at the optimum frequency is capable of better noise performance, because minimum noise conditions cannot be satisfied for the two-idler device at this pump frequency.

The maximum reverse loss for these conditions is 7.3 dB. For lower forward gain the backward loss increases relatively until for very low gain values (about 1 dB) the amplifier is unconditionally stable, i.e., the backward loss is larger than the forward gain.

The results show that, for most applications, it is possible to cascade many first-order or second-order lines before the amplitude response must be equalized.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Transmission lines","Propagation losses","Transfer functions","Conductors","Impedance","Attenuation","Dielectric losses","Conducting materials","Voltage"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1967.1126500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24924/01126500.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1967.1126500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Amplitude Response of a Coupled Transmission Line, All-Pass Network Having Loss","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1126500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Amplitude Response of a Coupled Transmission Line, All-Pass Network Having Loss","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126500/","volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1967","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Amplitude Response of a Coupled Transmission Line, All-Pass Network Having Loss","sourcePdf":"01126500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027254S","chronDate":"Aug 1967","isNumber":"24924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1126500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1126504,"authors":[{"name":"V.

This bend, called a coupler-type bend, permits complete coupling between two pillbox layers with a minimum of reflection, cross-polarization, and defocusing. It can be used with short focus antennas where large feed angles are involved. The coupler-type bend utilizes a metal plate between the pillbox layers; the plate coutains a pattern of holes which achieves the desired coupling. Analytical and experimental programs have been implemented to determine the optimum hole size and distribution. Simulation techniques in rectangular waveguide were employed for convenience in measurements. The bend design was measured to have a reflection less than 2 dB SWR over a ten percent frequeucy band; this is computed to contribute less than 0.2 dB SWR to the reflection seen by the feed-horn of a double-layer pillbox. The bend introduces less than --22 dB of cross-polarization in the antenna radiation. Measurements of a pillbox model incorporating the bend design have verified the predicted performance of the coupler-type bend.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1967.1126504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24924/01126504.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1967.1126504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24924","startPage":"462","endPage":"468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupler-Type Bend for Pillbox Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1126504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coupler-Type Bend for Pillbox Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1967","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126504/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1967","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1967","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupler-Type Bend for Pillbox Antennas","sourcePdf":"01126504.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029354S","chronDate":"August  1967","isNumber":"24924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1126504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1126505,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The fundamental mode of this structure is an E mode which is a surface wave. Its propagation behavior is analyzed in this paper and the equations are evaluated by highly accurate numerical methods. The semiconducting substrate is characterized by its dielectric constant and conductivity. A critical conductivity /spl sigma//sub min/ exists and is related to the cross sectional and material parameters. If the substrate conductivity is given by /spl sigma//sub min/ then the attenuation constant of the line is a minimum. The same value of conductivity yields minimum phase distortion at maximum bandwidth. If the conductivity is larger than /spl sigma//sub min/ the substrate acts as a poor conductor with associated skin effect; if it is smaller, lossy dielectric behavior results. Analysis shows that it is appropriate to subdivide the frequency range into three intervals. The lowest-frequency interval is characterized by propagation which resembles diffusion. This is caused by the loss in the dielectric layer. The next frequency range extends to some upper frequency which is determined by substrate conductivity and the cross-sectional dimensions. In this interval, the phase velocity of the fundamental mode is controlled by the ratio of dielectric to semiconductor thickness, which, if typical interconnections are considered, implies a very low velocity. This property indicates that the structure can serve as a delay line. Further increases in frequency result in higher phase velocities. Skin effect and dielectric loss behavior describe the propagation in this third interval.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1967.1126505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24924/01126505.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1967.1126505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel-Plate Waveguide Approach to Microminiaturized, Planar Transmission Lines for Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1967","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1967","displayDocTitle":"A Parallel-Plate Waveguide Approach to Microminiaturized, Planar Transmission Lines for Integrated Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1967","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel-Plate Waveguide Approach to Microminiaturized, Planar Transmission Lines for Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"01126505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030751S","chronDate":"August  1967","isNumber":"24924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"99","articleId":"1126505","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1126511,"authors":[{"name":"H.E.

Because interaction effects of dominant and higher-order modes between discontuities are allowed, finite-length obstructions can be studied. Solutions are found without any prior assumption about the total fields existing at the discontinuities and, as a result, the formulation is applicable to a wide range of problems. The technique proves to be simple and is ideally suited to computers, involving mainly the solution of sets of simultaneous linear equations. Thick and thin symmetrical bifurications of a rectangular guide are studied. Forward-scattered mode amplitudes and imput admittances are calculated, the computed admittance of the thin bifurication is compared with well-known results, and transverse field patterns on both sides of the junction are plotted, thus showing the accuracy of the match. The results of a finite-length bifurication by a thick vane are presented for a range of lengths, the parameters of the equivalent T network being given in each case. For very short lengths, the problem corresponds to an inductive strip across the guide.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1967.1126521","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24925/01126521.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1967.1126521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24925","startPage":"508","endPage":"517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solution of Waveguide Discontinuities by Modal Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1126521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Solution of Waveguide Discontinuities by Modal Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1967","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1967","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 1967","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solution of Waveguide Discontinuities by Modal Analysis","sourcePdf":"01126521.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023121S","chronDate":"September  1967","isNumber":"24925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"312","articleId":"1126521","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1126525,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Hamid","firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Hamid","id":"37301839900"},{"name":"M.M.

The electrical performance of such lumped elements is shown to be good enough to warrant their use in many applications where the size advantage or the resultant cost advantage is important. Miniature elements have been constructed which behave as true lumped reactive components up to at least 2.5 GHz. These elements have been evaluated using an impedance measurement method. Both inductors and capacitors have exhibited Qs greater than 50 at lower S band. Single-stage transistor power amplifiers at 2 GHz have been breadboarded using a simple arrangement of the lumped elements to match the measured impedances of the transistor pellet. These amplifiers have had gains as high as 4.7 dB at 2 GHz. The transistor used typically exhibits about 5 dB of gain in conventional coaxial circuitry. The loss in the lumped element matching networks has been about 0.5 dB greater than the loss in the distributed matching networks used in a microstrip amplifier built with the same type transistor. It is expected that the lumped circuit loss can be reduced as improved components are developed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24928/01126571.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1967.1126571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1967.1126571","startPage":"713","endPage":"721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lumped Elements in Microwave Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1967","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126571/","displayDocTitle":"Lumped Elements in Microwave Integrated Circuits","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"December 1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lumped Elements in Microwave Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"01126571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031571S","chronDate":"December  1967","isNumber":"24928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"39","articleId":"1126571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1126576,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

In the divider application, power entering the input port is split equally and with zero phase difference between the output ports. All ports are well matched and the output ports are highly isolated. The generalized form of the hyhrid circuit is a T junction followed by a multiplicity of cascaded pairs of TEM line lengths and interconnecting resistors. Due to symmetry, the resistors are decoupled from the input port, but they serve an essential function in providing output-port match and isolation. Each pair of lines and its associated resistor are referred to as a section. The one-section hybrid has been known and widely used. Its usable bandwidth is f/sub 2/ / f/sub 1/ =1.44:1 for VSWR <1.22 and isolation >20 dB. This paper shows that additional sections can provide a large increase in bandwidth. Some of the examples treated are as follows: two sections, f/sub 2/ / f/sub 1/ =2, VSWR <1.11, isolation> 27 dB; four sections, f/sub 2/ / f/sub 1/ =4, VSWR <1.10, isolation >26 dB; and seven sections, f/sub 2/ / f /sub 1/ =10, VSWR <1.21, isolation >19 dB.

For many years it has been known that modes of resonance occur in isolated dielectric bodies having air boundaries, and that very compact high-Q resonators can be achieved when /spl epsiv/ /sub r/, is high and tan /spl delta/ is low. High-purity TiO/sub 2/ ceramic material, for example, has an /spl epsiv/ /sub r/ about 100, tan /spl delta/ about 0.0001, and Q/sub u/ about 10 000. Practical applications of dielectric resonators have previously been limited by insufficient design information. Formulas are derived for the coupling coefficient between adjacent dielectric-disk resonators within a metal waveguide below cutoff. This metal enclosure is necessary for shielding and to prevent radiation loss. Comparisons between theoretical and experimental coupling coefficient values show very good agreement in each of the three bandpass configurations treated in this paper. Techniques of loop and probe coupling to the end resonators of a multiresonator bandpass filter are discussed and methods of supporting the resonators are suggested. The conclusion is made that microwave dielectric resonators offer important size reductions compared to conventional resonators of similar high Q, but that the center-frequency change of the dielectric resonators as a function of temperature is excessive for many applications. Temperature stabilization is one solution, but preferably a material should be developed having electrical characteristics similar to TiO/sub 2/ ceramic, but with at least an order of magnitude improvement in temperature sensitivity.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1968.1126654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24932/01126654.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1968.1126654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24932","startPage":"218","endPage":"227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Bandpass Filters Containing High-Q Dielectric Resonators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1126654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Bandpass Filters Containing High-Q Dielectric Resonators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1968","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Bandpass Filters Containing High-Q Dielectric Resonators","sourcePdf":"01126654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033777S","chronDate":"Apr 1968","isNumber":"24932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"342","articleId":"1126654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1126656,"authors":[{"name":"K.

These transmission lines are characterized by conducting strips, large ground planes, multi-dielectric-layer insulation, and planar geometry. The method is essentially based on a variational calculation of the line capacitance in the Fourier-transformed domain and on the charge density distribution as a trial function. A shielded double-layer microstrip line is analyzed by this method. Derived formulas for this structure are also applicable to simpler structures: a double-layer microstrip line, a shielded microstrip line, and a microstrip line. The calculated values of the line capacitance and the guide wavelength are compared with the measured values where possible. Oxide-layer effects on a silicon microstrip line and shielding effects on a sapphire microstrip line are also discussed based on this theory. The limitations and possible applications of this method are described.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1968.1126735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24936/01126735.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1968.1126735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24936","startPage":"529","endPage":"535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variational Method for the Analysis of Microstrip-Like Transmission Lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1126735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Variational Method for the Analysis of Microstrip-Like Transmission Lines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126735/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1968","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variational Method for the Analysis of Microstrip-Like Transmission Lines","sourcePdf":"01126735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021775S","chronDate":"Aug 1968","isNumber":"24936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"161","articleId":"1126735","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1126776,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

However, the target scintillation phenomenon, including Doppler scintillation, may be expressed as distortions of the RADAR echo signal propagating in space, independent of RADAR system parameters. In this form it is convenient for visualizing the overall effects on RADAR systems and how these effects are altered by the RADAR system parameters. Past literature has demonstrated the target angle scintillation as a distortion of the RADAR echo signal phase front. Extension of this approach by a Poynting-vector analysis of the RADAR echo signal from a complex source shows a corresponding deviation of the direction of power flow consistent with the phase-front distortion theory and target scintillation measurements as well as describing all other target scintillation characteristics. The analysis demonstrates that deviations in the direction of the echo signal power flow from a complex target can be so large that the apparent source falls many target spans away from the actual target location. This is demonstrated by both tracking RADAR and single-beam search-t ype RADAR experiments. Although the theoretical angle deviations approach infinite error in target location, RADAR parameters, such as the finite size antenna aperture which perform a space integration of the echo signal, impose practical limitations. Typically, when a complex target such as an aircraft subtends an angle approaching a few tenths of a beamwidth, the antenna aperture integration will significantly limit the rms angle scintillation. Furthermore, the ways in which intentional means, such as diversity techniques, may be employed to reduce the effects of target scintillation on a RADAR are observed in Poynting-vector analysis. The analysis of the echo signal propagating in space provides a readily visualized basis for derivation of the Doppler scintillation caused by the airframe (rigid body portion) of a complex target which spreads the Doppler over a finite bandwidth when it has random yaw, pitch, and roll motion typical of aircraft in flight. The derivation relates the Doppler scintillation to the angle scintillation and the random motions typical of aircraft targets. A typical aircraft target with Gaussian-distributed angle scintillation and Gaussian-distributed rates of random motion will have a spike-shaped Doppler spectrum described by the modified Hankel function K/sub 0/ where the parameters are determined from the values of the rms angle scintillation and the rms angular rates of random motion. These values can be closely approximated without extensive measurements on the target. Experimental results verify the theory. The expressions used to derive the Doppler spectrum may be modified to accommodate non-Gaussian distributed angle scintillation and rates of angle motion.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1968.1126776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1968.1126776","startPage":"715","endPage":"728","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24937/01126776.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RADAR Target Amplitude, Angle, and Doppler Scintillation from Analysis of the Echo Signal Propagating in Space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1968","displayDocTitle":"RADAR Target Amplitude, Angle, and Doppler Scintillation from Analysis of the Echo Signal Propagating in Space","publicationDate":"September 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"16","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126776/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RADAR Target Amplitude, Angle, and Doppler Scintillation from Analysis of the Echo Signal Propagating in Space","sourcePdf":"01126776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025192S","chronDate":"Sep 1968","isNumber":"24937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1126776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1126779,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

The introduction of a pulsed carrier cancellation principle permits, for the first time, an investigation of the additive noise of pulsed amplifiers down to the thermal noise level. The measurement apparatus consists of three channels fed from a common source. One channel contains the amplifier under test. The other channel is pulsed by a \"noise-free\" modulator with the same pulse parameters as those of the test channel. The two signals are algebraically cancelled in a hybrid circuit and the difference signal, containing only the noise sideband of the amplifier, is coherently detected with the signal in the third channel.

The analysis is based on the equivalent four-port network of the coupler, the apertures being represented by lumped reactances in series and/or shunt with dispersive transmission lines, representing the waveguides. The effects of finite aperture dimensions and common wall thickness are taken into account. Many couplers designed on the usual basis of a first-order loose-coupling approximation have good directivity, even for tight (3 dB) coupling, but previous theories do not give the predicted directivity and are often far from optimum in design. A new synthesis technique based on the distributed low-pass prototype filter has been devised, and shown to give results close to the predicted performance. It has led to the construction of compact multiaperture directional couplers having directivity greater than 43 dB over complete waveguide operating bands.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Synthesis of Waveguide Multiaperture Directional Couplers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Synthesis of Waveguide Multiaperture Directional Couplers","sourcePdf":"01126855.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019073S","chronDate":"Dec 1968","isNumber":"24940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"80","articleId":"1126855","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1126858,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

The program uses a new method of analysis based on approximate extremization of a functional whose Euler equation is the scalar Helmholtz equation, subject to homogeneous boundary conditions. Subdividing the guide cross section into triangular regions and assuming the solution to be representable by a polynomial in each region, the variational problem is approximated by a matrix eigenvalue problem, which is solved by Householder tridiagonalization and Sturm sequences. For reasonably simple convex polygonal guide shapes, the dominant eigenfrequencies are obtained to 5-6 significant figures; for nonconvex or complicated shapes, the accuracy may fall to 3 significant figures. Use of the program is illustrated by calculating the propagating modes of a class of degenerate mode guides of current interest, for which experimental data are available. Numerical studies of convergence rate and discretization error are also described. It is believed that the new program produces waveguide analyses of higher accuracy than any general program previously available.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24944/01126932.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1969.1126932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1969.1126932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24944","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1126932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General High-Order Finite-Element Analysis Program Waveguide","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Shape","Equations","Band pass filters","Circuit theory","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave filters","Cutoff frequency","Boundary conditions","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1126932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1969","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1969","displayDocTitle":"A General High-Order Finite-Element Analysis Program Waveguide","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1969","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General High-Order Finite-Element Analysis Program Waveguide","sourcePdf":"01126932.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04039S","chronDate":"Apr 1969","isNumber":"24944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"111","articleId":"1126932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1126946,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The method, which is based on pattern search, was specifically developed for the automatic optimization by computer of networks for which the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of some response from a desired ideal response specification. Minimax response objectives, which can lead to equal-ripple optima, will in general give rise to discontinuous partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to the network parameters. Otherwise efficient optimization methods may slow down or even fail to reach an optimum in such circumstances, particularly when the response hypersurface has a narrow curved valley along which the path of discontinuous derivatives lies. Another direct search method called ripple search is also presented. This method was developed to locate the extrema of multimodal functions of one variable in an efficient manner, and is used to determine the maximum deviation of the response from the desired response. Sufficiently detailed flow diagrams are available so that the methods can be readily programmed. The razor search strategy (with ripple search) has been successfully applied to the optimization of inhomogeneous waveguide transformers. It is illustrated in this paper by examples of cascaded commensurate and noncoummensurate transmission lines acting as impedance transformers for which the optima are known.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1969.1127006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1969.1127006","startPage":"552","endPage":"562","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24948/01127006.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Microwave Networks by Razor Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1969","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Microwave Networks by Razor Search","publicationDate":"August 1969","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"17","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127006/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Microwave Networks by Razor Search","sourcePdf":"01127006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040264S","chronDate":"Aug 1969","isNumber":"24948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1127006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1127007,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

The formulation is sufficiently flexible to allow nonideal junction discontinuity effects and mismatched terminations to be taken into account during optimization. Constraints placed on the width, height, or length of any section need be dictated only by considerations for dominant mode propagation and the requirement of small (but not necessarily negligible) junction discontinuities. The objective of the present formulation is a minimax equal-ripple response over a predetermined frequency band satisfying the constraints selected for the particular problem. The ripple search strategy to locate the maximum reflection coefficient within the band and the razor search strategy to minimize it, as described by Bandler and Macdonald in another paper, were employed. Constrained optimum equal-ripple solutions to examples previously published by Young, Matthaei et al. and Riblet are presented. They demonstrate the considerable improvements made possible by the present formulation with regard to performance, reduction in number of sections, and physical size. The approach used in this paper should also find application in the design of broadband microwave matching or equalizing networks consisting of noncommensurate components and for which exact synthesis techniques may be unavailable.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1969.1127007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24948/01127007.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1969.1127007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24948","startPage":"563","endPage":"571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer Optimization of Inhomogeneous Waveguide Transformers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1127007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Computer Optimization of Inhomogeneous Waveguide Transformers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127007/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1969","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1969","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer Optimization of Inhomogeneous Waveguide Transformers","sourcePdf":"01127007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025156S","chronDate":"Aug 1969","isNumber":"24948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"28","articleId":"1127007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1127016,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

A single ground plane, a single dielectric, and a single layer of metallization are used. Thus the approach is eminently suited for monolithic or hybrid thin-film microwave integrated circuitry. Tight coupling is achieved much more easily than with noninterdigitated edge-coupled lines. Fabrication and tolerance problems make it almost impossible to build noninterdigitated 3-dB edge couplers. Also, current crowding at the edges, which can result in high loss, is much less severe for the interdigitated coupler. Previously, tight coupling in directional couplers for microwave integrated circuits has been achieved by broadside coupling, reentrant sections, tandem sections, or branch-line couplers. Some of the disadvantages of these approaches are narrow bandwidth, large substrate area, and the need for multilayer circuitry. A 3dB directional coupler (quadrature hybrid) for S band has been fabricated in microstrip on 40-mil alumina. A single quarter-wave section was used. The hybrid showed a directivity of over 27 dB, a return loss of over 25 dB, an insertion loss of less than 0.13 dB, and an imbalance of less than 0.25 dB over a 40 percent bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1969.1127115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24952/01127115.pdf","startPage":"1150","endPage":"1151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1969.1127115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interdigitated Stripline Quadrature Hybrid (Correspondence)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1127115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127115/","displayDocTitle":"Interdigitated Stripline Quadrature Hybrid (Correspondence)","volume":"17","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interdigitated Stripline Quadrature Hybrid (Correspondence)","sourcePdf":"01127115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046716S","chronDate":"Dec 1969","isNumber":"24952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"269","articleId":"1127115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1127126,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.

The excitation is considered to be a plane wave incident at any arbitrary angle. The aperture dimensions and array element spacings were assumed to be comparable with the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic field. The solution given can include the effect of a dielectric slab used to support the thin conducting sheet. The solution is obtained by matching the tangential field components at the surface of the screen. The resulting integral equation is solved by the method of moments which reduces the integral equation to a system of linear algebraic equations that can be solved with the use of a digital computer. Accurate results for both the magnitude and phase of the aperture field distribution and the transmission coefficients for the propagating modes are determined explicitly for a specific example of slots arranged in an equilateral triangular lattice. The balance of power flow between the reflected and the transmitted waves has been checked with satisfactory results. The solution can be applied to the problem of scattering from a conducting screen with periodic apertures and to the complementary problem of scattering from a set of conducting plates by the use of Babinet's principle.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1970.1127298","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24961/01127298.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1970.1127298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"627","endPage":"632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission through a Conducting Screen Perforated Periodically with Apertures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1127298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1970","displayDocTitle":"Transmission through a Conducting Screen Perforated Periodically with Apertures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127298/","volume":"18","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1970","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission through a Conducting Screen Perforated Periodically with Apertures","sourcePdf":"01127298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021293S","chronDate":"Sep 1970","isNumber":"24961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"190","articleId":"1127298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1127301,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

The diodes under investigation are of a silicon p/sup +/-n-n/sup +/ mesa structure. The breakdown voltage is 160 volts; the punch-through voltage is 60 volts. The test setup is similar to a conventional reflection-type amplifier with the diode mounted in a coaxial-cavity-like circuit. The reverse-bias pulse drives the diode to a low avalanche current level at which anomalous operation would normally commence. In this case, however, the tuning and loading of the cavity and its associated stubs is intentionally arranged to minimize free-running oscillations. Any residual RF power is reduced to the level of weak instabilities without any strong harmonics or subharmonic. Only in the presence of an input driving power with a frequency at or near the resonance frequency of the system, does an amplified power of the same frequency appear at the output port. Starting from the residual level the output power increases proportionally with the input power until at higher drives a saturation level is reached. In this particular case, operating at 410 MHz, saturation is reached at 18.5 watts with a maximum power gain of 12 dB and a bandwidth of 26 MHz. This output is approximately 20 to 30 dB higher in amplitude than any observable peak in the residual broad-band frequency spectrum Operating the diode as a free-running \"hard\" oscillator at the same current level and frequency, 18.8 Watts of RF power is obtained. The initial and steady-state power levels are substantially the same for both amplifier and oscillator. A plausible evaluation of these results can be obtained following van der Pol's differential equation for a forced negative-resistance oscillator.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Amplification with Anomalous Avalanche Diodes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1970.1127375","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24963/01127375.pdf","startPage":"956","endPage":"963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1970.1127375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24963","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1127375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1970","displayDocTitle":"Power Amplification with Anomalous Avalanche Diodes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"November 1970","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Amplification with Anomalous Avalanche Diodes","sourcePdf":"01127375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036528S","chronDate":"Nov 1970","isNumber":"24963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1127375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1127381,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An algorithm was described that employed a thirteen-point finite-difference operator formed from five constituent five-point operators, such that the resulting matrix was positive semidefinite at the correct eigenvalue and was positive definite otherwise. For compactness the method is called positive definite successive overrelaxation (PDSOR). For simplicity boundary fitting was accomplished by causing horizontal waveguide deformations at each horizontal mesh line to the nearest node point. This paper describes an improvement of the PDSOR algorithm to cater for unequal-armed operators so that the waveguide wall need not be distorted from its actual shape. Improved accuracy is obtained for fields in the vicinity of the boundary and for eigenvalues. A finite-difference first-order perturbation method (that makes use of the accurately determined wall currents) for attenuation in arbitrarily shaped waveguides is described. Normalized curves are presented giving attenuation of sets of TE and TM modes in circular, lunar, T-septate lunar, single-ridge, and T-septate rectangular waveguides.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127423/","volume":"18","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 1970","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1970","displayDocTitle":"Unequal-Arm Finite-Difference Operators in the Positive-Definite Successive Overrelaxation (PDSOR) Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal-Arm Finite-Difference Operators in the Positive-Definite Successive Overrelaxation (PDSOR) Algorithm","sourcePdf":"01127423.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032792S","chronDate":"Dec 1970","isNumber":"24964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1127423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1127440,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The three-ports consist of n sections in cascade with each section composed of two coupled lossless transmission lines of electrical length /spl theta/ and an intermediate resistor. The main object is to analyze and design broad-band unsymmetrical structures with the symmetrical three-port as a special and important case. The analysis of the three-port is performed by means of a more convenient four-port analysis. An even-odd-mode method is used and a new definition of the odd mode is introduced. This new definition considerably simplfies the treatment of unsymmetrical three-and four-ports with one half of the network identical to the other apart from an impedance scaling factor. The analysis yields two uncoupled two-ports in each mode. The even-mode networks are identical with cascaded quarter-wave impedance transformers while the odd-mode networks contain all the resistors. A new technique for their design is presented and a computer program for complete synthesis of hybrid three-ports has been worked out. Several experimental stripline three-ports were built. A three-section unsymmetrical (k=1.7) matched three-port showed a measured isolation better than 20 dB and a maximum VSWR of 1.3 from 5 to 12 GHz. The total loss of a four-section equal-power divider was 0.2dB, maximum VSWR 1.25, and minimum isolation 23 dB over the frequency range 2.5-12.0 GHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24965/01127448.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"88","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1971.1127448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1971.1127448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24965","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1127448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method of Synthesizing Matched Broad-Band TEM-Mode Three-Ports","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistors","Performance analysis","Impedance","Couplings","Propagation losses","Transmission lines","Transformers","Network synthesis","Stripline","Frequency conversion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1971","displayDocTitle":"A New Method of Synthesizing Matched Broad-Band TEM-Mode Three-Ports","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1971","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method of Synthesizing Matched Broad-Band TEM-Mode Three-Ports","sourcePdf":"01127448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023637S","chronDate":"Jan.  1971","isNumber":"24965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"80","articleId":"1127448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1127482,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

It is shown that the semi-infinite slab model is inappropriate for calculating the microwave radiation dosage for the human head and similar structures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/6811101/01127482.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1968.1127482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1968.1127482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6811101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1127482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Induced Fields and Heating Within a Cranial Structure Irradiated by an Electromagnetic Plane Wave","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic heating","Cranial","Electromagnetic scattering","Electromagnetic fields","Biological system modeling","Uncertainty","Biological materials","Biology computing","Slabs","Radiation dosage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1971","displayDocTitle":"Induced Fields and Heating Within a Cranial Structure Irradiated by an Electromagnetic Plane Wave","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1971","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Induced Fields and Heating Within a Cranial Structure Irradiated by an Electromagnetic Plane Wave","sourcePdf":"01127482.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042541S","chronDate":"February  1971","isNumber":"6811101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"122","articleId":"1127482","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1127484,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

This paper describes a method for rapid evaluation of these fields in tissues of arbitrary shape and characteristics when they are exposed to various sources including plane wave, aperture, slot, and dipole sources. The method, valid for both far- and near-zone fields, involves the use of a thermograph camera for recording temperature disitributions produced by energy absorption in phantom models of the tissue structures. The magnitude of the electric field may then be obtained anywhere on the model as a function of the square root of the magnitude of the calculated heating pattern. The phantoms are composed of materials with dielectric and geometric properties identical to the tissue structures which they represent. The validity of the technique is verified by comparing the results of the experimental approach with the theoretical results obtained for the case of plane layers of tissue exposed to a rectangular aperture source and cylindrical layers of tissue exposed to a plane-wave source. This technique has been used successfully by the author for improving microwave applicators.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyses of Electromagnetic Fields Induced in Biological Tissues by Thermographic Studies on Equivalent Phantom Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1968.1127484","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/6811101/01127484.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1968.1127484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6811101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1127484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127484/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1971","displayDocTitle":"Analyses of Electromagnetic Fields Induced in Biological Tissues by Thermographic Studies on Equivalent Phantom Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"February 1971","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyses of Electromagnetic Fields Induced in Biological Tissues by Thermographic Studies on Equivalent Phantom Models","sourcePdf":"01127484.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058372S","chronDate":"February  1971","isNumber":"6811101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"346","articleId":"1127484","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1127485,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

In particular, a satisfactory treatment of closely coupled and narrow lines is obtained where, because of the dominance of the edge singularity, \"mesh point\" analyses are inadequate. The present work was carried through to meet the need in interactive design procedures for characterization of a general transmission geometry. For these procedures, algorithms are required that take little storage and are suitable for very rapid calculations. Capacitance formulas are derived from variational series based on conformal transformations, and these series are converted to easily evaluated finite forms. Calculation of the even- and odd-mode fringing capacitances for coupled limes is made for finite line widths assuming a periodic array of lines. The applicability of these capacitances to a single pair of lines and to finite filter arrays has been checked experimentally. Routines for lower bound values of fringing capacitances are given. Upper bound formulations validate the accuracy of the lower bound calculations.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1971.1127543","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24968/01127543.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1971.1127543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"424","endPage":"431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Even- and Odd-Mode Capacitance Parameters for Coupled Lines in Suspended Substrate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1127543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1971","displayDocTitle":"The Even- and Odd-Mode Capacitance Parameters for Coupled Lines in Suspended Substrate","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127543/","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1971","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Even- and Odd-Mode Capacitance Parameters for Coupled Lines in Suspended Substrate","sourcePdf":"01127543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034905S","chronDate":"May  1971","isNumber":"24968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"58","articleId":"1127543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1127550,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Studies on amplifier impedance matching and transforming networks have resulted in the achievement of a 35-dB-gain 6-W-CW 26-percent-efficient amplifier at 2.25 GHz using only lumped elements. Construction of lumped-element low-pass filters and 3-dB quadrature hybrids at S band have produced circuits much smaller than, but with performance comparable to, microstrip distributed circuits. At C band a large-impedance transformer operating as a filter had less than 0.4-dB loss for an impedance transformation close to 20:1. The performance of lumped-element circuits through X band is compared with that of distributed circuits from the standpoint of size, economy, and technological applications. Lumped-element circuits are competitive with distributed circuits through 6 GHz and are practical through 12 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul.  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul.  1971","publicationDate":"Jul. 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"19","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Status of Lumped Elements in Microwave Integrated Circuits - Present and Future","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Status of Lumped Elements in Microwave Integrated Circuits - Present and Future","sourcePdf":"01127586.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055725S","chronDate":"Jul.  1971","isNumber":"24970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"48","articleId":"1127586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1127598,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The oscillator noise is shown to consist of three different contributions: modulation noise, selectively amplified primary noise, and conversion noise. The influence of the active device nonlinearity and load circuit parameters is discussed in detail. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. It is especially pointed out that the large correlation between AM and FM fluctuations, usually measured in IMPATT oscillators, indicates nonoptimum AM noise performance. Experimental techniques for achieving optimum AM noise performance are demonstrated (orthogonal noise tuning). By a simple extension of the model, the noise behavior of an injection phase-locked oscillator can be described. The calculated AM and FM noise power spectra for the synchronized oscillator are also shown to be in good agreement with experimental results. Finally the signal-to-noise ratio for current modulated IMPATT oscillators is investigated and optimization is demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1971","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Aug. 1971","volume":"19","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noise in IMPATT Diode Amplifiers and Oscillators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise in IMPATT Diode Amplifiers and Oscillators","sourcePdf":"01127611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032396S","chronDate":"Aug.  1971","isNumber":"24971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"32","articleId":"1127611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1127612,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

The driving-point impedance of this mount has also been considered experimentally. A novel measurement technique is used based upon the use of subminiature coaxial line to gain electrical access to the terminal pair located inside the waveguide. A model of the measurement circuit, which enhances the accuracy of the results, providing excellent agreement between the theoretical and measured values, is developed. The multilateral nature of the circuit allows consideration of the mount in the waveguide as an obstacle to any incident propagating mode. Some related measurements have been made using standard techniques for the H/sub 10/ mode.

This approach, however, allows treatment of rather complex finite geometric configurations that are useful in the design of modern thin-film circuits. An integral representation of the Green's functions for the desired mathematical model is presented in which ground planes are assumed at finite distances from the dielectric sheet.

They are the lumped-constant (0-dimensional) circuit, distributed-constant (1-dimensional) circuit, and waveguide (3-dimensional) circuit. The planar circuit to be discussed in general in this paper is a circuit category that should be positioned as a 2-dimensional circuit. It is defined as an \"electrical circuit having dimensions comparable to the wavelength in two directions, but much less thickness in one direction.\" The main subject of this paper is the computer analysis of an arbitrarily shaped, triplate planar circuit. It is shown that a computer analysis based upon a contour-integral solution of the wave equation offers an accurate and efficient tool in the design of the planar circuit. Results of some computer calculations are described. It is also shown that the circuit parameters can be derived directly from Green's function of the wave equation when the shape of the circuit is relatively simple.

The model is an extension of a three-port circuit which has been useful for representing periodic transducers. The extended model includes the effects of strong piezoelectric coupling whereby the acoustic waves and electric circuits interact, and it also accounts for reflections of acoustic waves which result from perturbations of the crystal surface by the metal electrodes. The inclusion of the latter effect is shown to be essential for explaining observed levels of triple-transit echos in filters and delay lines. The circuit model is used to derive a transducer design procedure which determines the electrode positions and the anodization function (acoustic aperture taper) required to reproduce a desired waveform. This procedure is applicable to the design of weighted dispersive filters and broad-band nondispersive delay lines. In order to verify the theory a low-loss octave-bandwidth nondispersive delay line was designed using linear FM dispersive transducers on YZ LiNbO/sub 3/. The performance of this device was found to be in good agreement with the circuit model predictions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jul. 1972","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Dispersive Interdigital Surface-Wave Transducers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of Dispersive Interdigital Surface-Wave Transducers","sourcePdf":"01127786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07162S","chronDate":"Jul 1972","isNumber":"24981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"105","articleId":"1127786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1127797,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The scattering loss of a waveguide with a gradual index distribution is smaller than that of a three-layer waveguide when the transverse correlation is small, but it is not much altered when the transverse correlation is large.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1972.1127800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24982/01127800.pdf","startPage":"524","endPage":"531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1972.1127800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation Mode and Scattering Loss of a Two-Dimensional Dielectric Waveguide with Gradual Distribution of Refractive Index","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1127800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127800/","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Mode and Scattering Loss of a Two-Dimensional Dielectric Waveguide with Gradual Distribution of Refractive Index","volume":"20","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1972","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation Mode and Scattering Loss of a Two-Dimensional Dielectric Waveguide with Gradual Distribution of Refractive Index","sourcePdf":"01127800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056202S","chronDate":"Aug 1972","isNumber":"24982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"47","articleId":"1127800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1127819,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The Type A filter has been found to yield practical impedance levels for narrow to approximately 25-percent bandwidths.

It is shown how suitable and reasonably well conditioned objective functions can be formulated, giving particular emphasis to more general approximation problems as, for example, in filter design. It is demonstrated how easily and efficiently extremely near minimax results can be achieved on a discrete set of sample points. Highly efficient gradient methods can be employed and, in network design problems, the use of the adjoint network approach for evaluating gradients results in greater savings in computer effort. A comparison between the Fletcher-Powell method and the more recent Fletcher method is made on the application of least pth approximation, using a range of values of p up to 1 000 000 000 000 on transmission-line transformer problems for which optimal minimax solutions are known.

(The method permits the use of free-space Green's functions, and thus special problem-dependent Green's functions need not be found.) The integral equation is formulated as a constraint upon the local picture-frame solutions, whence these local solutions are solved directly by a variational method, using finite elements, in a manner such that the problem of the Green's-function singularity is side-stepped. The technique is applicable where sources and media inhomogeneities and anisotropies are local, and can all be placed within one or several picture frames. It is in these cases that the integral-equation approach is at a particular disadvantage, and the use of a partial differential-equation technique is advisable if not necessary. Examples presented include the static and harmonic fields of a parallel-plate capacitor, a microstrip line on a dielectric substratum, and a radiating antenna with dielectric obstacles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Element Solution of Unbounded Field Problems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1972.1127895","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24986/01127895.pdf","startPage":"841","endPage":"847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1972.1127895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24986","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1127895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1972","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Element Solution of Unbounded Field Problems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Dec. 1972","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Element Solution of Unbounded Field Problems","sourcePdf":"01127895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029241S","chronDate":"Dec 1972","isNumber":"24986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"188","articleId":"1127895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1127906,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Chun Chen","affiliation":["Hughes Ground Systems, Hughes Aircraft Company, Fullerton, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chao-Chun Chen","id":"38226568500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"1127906","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":198,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":1139},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Band pass filters","Integral equations","Admittance","Circuits","Microwave filters","Hazards","Resonance","Propagation constant","Chaos"]}],"abstract":"Transmission characteristics of a thick conducting plate perforated with either circular or rectangular holes are presented.

Effects due to sideband correlation in the equivalent noise source are included. A rotating wave approximation (RWA) developed by Lax is used in obtaining the amplitude and phase noise spectra. Conditions are given for phase stabilization of free-running oscillators and for minimum phase noise in phase-Iocked oscillators and amplifiers. Stability criteria, discussion of spurious sidetones, and effects of a noisy synchronizing signal are given. The noise measure is used to obtain alternative expressions for the noise spectra and the carrier-to-noise ratios of locked oscillators and amplifiers. It is shown that the noise power gain of AM fluctuations is usually much lower than the corresponding gain for FM noise. The theory should be useful in optimizing the noise performance of nonlinear RF generators, such as IMPATT, BARITT, and Gunn diode oscillators.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1973.1127944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1973.1127944","startPage":"127","endPage":"134","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24989/01127944.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise in Single-Frequlency Oscillators and Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1973","displayDocTitle":"Noise in Single-Frequlency Oscillators and Amplifiers","publicationDate":"Mar. 1973","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127944/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise in Single-Frequlency Oscillators and Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01127944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025504S","chronDate":"Mar 1973","isNumber":"24989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1127944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1127951,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

The SAW TDL operates at 120-MHz center frequency with 100-ns spacing between adjacent taps for a 10-MHz chip rate. The output of each tap can be individually switched to a load with 0 or 180/spl deg/ phase shift by the silicon-on-sapphire integrated control circuits. The high-speed capability of silicon-on-sapphire integrated circuits allows programming (code changing) to be achieved with a serial data input at 10-MHz rates, while the low temperature coefficient of ST-cut quartz allows satisfactory operation over a wide temperature range (-25/spl deg/C to +85/spl deg/C).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1127983/","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Apr. 1973","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1973","displayDocTitle":"A Programmable Surface Acoustic Wave Matched Filter for Phase-Coded Spread Spectrum Waveforms (Short Papers)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Programmable Surface Acoustic Wave Matched Filter for Phase-Coded Spread Spectrum Waveforms (Short Papers)","sourcePdf":"01127983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072163S","chronDate":"Apr 1973","isNumber":"24990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1127983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1127989,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

These two observations make it possible to extend modified small-signal S-parameter design techniques to large-signal power amplifiers.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1973.1128136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1973.1128136","startPage":"809","endPage":"814","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24998/01128136.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF Amplifier Design with Large-Signal S-Parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1973","displayDocTitle":"RF Amplifier Design with Large-Signal S-Parameters","publicationDate":"Dec. 1973","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"21","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1128136/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF Amplifier Design with Large-Signal S-Parameters","sourcePdf":"01128136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025817S","chronDate":"Dec 1973","isNumber":"24998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"34","articleId":"1128136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1128159,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

This is an extension of an earlier approach which only allowed either load reflection coefficient or source reflection coefficient to be considered in a given design. Through the use of a specification statement of VSWR, it is shown how a marginal stability factor can be derived. From the study of the interaction between the input and output reflection coefficients, a detuning factor is analytically derived to correlate the interaction between the input and output reflection coefficients. Either of these factors can be chosen and used to select optimum input and output reflection coefficients which provide stable operation for an amplifying stage that is to employ a conditionally stable active element. An example using these factors is given.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=24999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1974.1128159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/24999/01128159.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"48","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1974.1128159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattering Parameter Approach to the Design of Narrow-Band Amplifiers Employing Conditionally Stable Active Elements (Short Papers)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1974","displayDocTitle":"Scattering Parameter Approach to the Design of Narrow-Band Amplifiers Employing Conditionally Stable Active Elements (Short Papers)","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1974","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1128159/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1974","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattering Parameter Approach to the Design of Narrow-Band Amplifiers Employing Conditionally Stable Active Elements (Short Papers)","sourcePdf":"01128159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058915S","chronDate":"Jan 1974","isNumber":"24999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1128159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1128202,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is suggested that high-resistivity silicon be used as a medium for a dielectric waveguide. With the advent of high-resistivity silicon, propagation can occur with relatively low Ioss. Furthermore, since the medium is a semiconductor compatible with active devices, it is proposed that active devices can be constructed directly in the semiconductor dielectric guide or appendaged directly on the surface. The basic approach is similar to that used in integrated optics, except that the medium for millimeter-wave guidance is a semiconductor and the control devices rely on conductivity modulation rather than on electrooptical effects. Some particular devices suggested are oscillator, mechanical and electronic phase shifters, amplitude modulators (switches), and detectors. The first of such devices investigated has been the electronic phase shtiter. Related theory and experiments are reported here. In addition, preliminary results on oscillators imbedded in a dielectric resonator are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1974","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1128240/","volume":"22","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Apr. 1974","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Electronic Phase Shifter for Millimeter-Wave Semiconductor Dielectric Integrated Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic Phase Shifter for Millimeter-Wave Semiconductor Dielectric Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"01128240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108941S","chronDate":"Apr 1974","isNumber":"25002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"62","articleId":"1128240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1128242,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

The error parameters, i.e., the scattering parameters of the measuring system, are six respective ten complex numbers for each frequency of interest. A calibration procedure, where measurements are made on standards, will determine the error parameters. One of many possible calibration procedures is briefly described.

The repeater is totally solid state for miniaturization, high reliability and economy with the adoption of microwave IC's, monolithic lC's, and direct oscillation by Gunn diodes in the 20-GHz band. The modulation and demodulation techniques of the repeater employ QPSK, which has a theoretical advantage over FSK, DPSK, or ASK in error rate performance, considering spectrum utilization. The error rate performance is further improved by using a simple digital equalization for intersymbol interference. The error rate performance of this system was measured. From the test results, it became evident that the equivalent carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N) degradation of error rate performance at a 10/sup -6/ error rate was about 5 dB under fixed temperature conditions and that the equivalent C/N degradation due to a -10/spl deg/C to +45/spl deg/C temperature variation was only 1 dB.

At 10 GHz the MESFET, with an inductive second-gate termination, exhibits an 18-dB gain with --26-dB reverse isolation. Variation of the second-gate potential yields a 44-dB gain-modulation range. The minimum noise figure is 4.0 dB with 12-dB associated gain at 10 GHz. Pulse modulation of an RF carrier with a 65-ps fall ad a 100-ps rise time is demonstrated. The dual-gate MESFET with high gain and low noise figure is especially suited for receiver amplifiers with automatic gain control (AGC) as an option. The MESFET is equally attractive for subnanosecond pulsed-amplitude modulation (PAM), phase-shift-keyed (PSK), and frequency-shift-keyed (FSK) carrier modulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1128602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1975","volume":"23","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Jun. 1975","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Dual-Gate GaAs MESFET's as Gain-Controlled Low-Noise Amplifiers and High-Speed Modulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Dual-Gate GaAs MESFET's as Gain-Controlled Low-Noise Amplifiers and High-Speed Modulators","sourcePdf":"01128602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031587S","chronDate":"Jun 1975","isNumber":"25017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"75","articleId":"1128602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1128606,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

The method treats the irradiation of the scatterer as an initial value problem. At t = 0, a plane-wave source of frequency f is assumed to be turned on. The diffraction of waves from this source is modeled by repeatedly solving a finite-difference analog of the time-dependent Maxwell's equations. Time stepping is continued until sinusoidual steady-state field values are observed at all points within the scatterer. The envelope of the standing wave is taken as the steady-state scattered field. As an example of this method, the computed results for a dielectric cylinder scatterer are presented. An error of less than /spl plusmn/10 percent in locating and evaluating the standing-wave peaks within the cylinder is achieved for a program execution time of 1 min. The extension of this method to the solution of the fields within three-dimensional dielectric scatterers is outlined.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25019/01128640.pdf","startPage":"623","endPage":"630","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1975.1128640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1975.1128640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25019","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1128640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical Solution of Steady-State Electromagnetic Scattering Problems Using the Time-Dependent Maxwell's Equations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steady-state","Electromagnetic scattering","Maxwell equations","Dielectrics","Integral equations","Engine cylinders","Wave functions","Electromagnetic fields","Frequency","Electromagnetic diffraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1128640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1975","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1975","displayDocTitle":"Numerical Solution of Steady-State Electromagnetic Scattering Problems Using the Time-Dependent Maxwell's Equations","volume":"23","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1975","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical Solution of Steady-State Electromagnetic Scattering Problems Using the Time-Dependent Maxwell's Equations","sourcePdf":"01128640.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038012S","chronDate":"Aug 1975","isNumber":"25019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"888","articleId":"1128640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1128641,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

It is based on successive linear approximations to the nonlinear functions defining the problem. Adequate modeling of distributed parameter circuits for optimization purposes often involves parasitic, etc., which makes the gradient computation by the adjoint network method or related methods rather complicated, and often numerical errors are introduced in the gradients. Consequently, the algorithm is found to be of particular relevance in optimum design of practical microwave networks. The relative advantages of the proposed algorithm are established by comparison with known gradient and nongradient algorithms based on optimization of cascaded transmission-line transformers. The relevance to microwave filter design is demonstrated by an example which represents an improvement of analytical filter design results. Finally, optimum broad-band design of a practical coaxial transferred-electron reflection-type amplilier is carried out by means of the proposed method. The results are supported by experimental verification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1128686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1975","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1975","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Oct. 1975","volume":"23","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Minimax Design of Networks without Using Derivatives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Minimax Design of Networks without Using Derivatives","sourcePdf":"01128686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049053S","chronDate":"Oct 1975","isNumber":"25021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"26","articleId":"1128686","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1128708,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This novel method of input-output coupling allows a coplanar arrangement of input and output microstrip lines. Often the balanced and unbalanced line impedances in a balun are unequal, necessitating an impedance-matching network. A first-order reflection coefficient theory that mutually considers the impedance effects of the balun cavity, a compensating stub, and a quarter-wave transformer is used to design wide-band impedance-matched baluns. Curves of VSWR versus bandwidth are presented for several balanced-to-unbalanced line-impedance ratios. Experimental results are given for an octave-band impedance-matched balun with a balanced-to-unbalanced impedance ratio of 2:1. The new wide-band balun is adaptable to a microstrip magic tee. A proposed magic tee that relies on circuit symmetry for operation has multioctave bandwidth potential.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1976.1128794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25026","startPage":"135","endPage":"141","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25026/01128794.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Impedance-Matched Wide-Band Balun and Magic Tee","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1128794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1976","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Impedance-Matched Wide-Band Balun and Magic Tee","publicationDate":"Mar. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Impedance-Matched Wide-Band Balun and Magic Tee","sourcePdf":"01128794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030795S","chronDate":"Mar 1976","isNumber":"25026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","articleId":"1128794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1128796,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.C. van Heuven","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"J.H.C.","lastName":"van Heuven","id":"37297391900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"1128796","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1114},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Waveguide transitions","Microstrip","Circuits","Frequency","Inductance","Arm","Microwave theory and techniques","Wideband","Reproducibility of results","Attenuation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1128796","abstract":"A new waveguide-microstrip transition is described.

These types of filters may be regarded as representing the least possible degree of complication over the conventional Chebyshev filter, and are usually realized with one extra cross coupling in the structure. It is demonstrated that this gives much improved skirt selectivity in the case of a finite frequency pole, making it a viable intermediate case between the Chebyshev and elliptic function filters, while in the case of real-frequency zeros, very flat group delay over 50 percent of the passband is achieved with minimal cost in insertion loss and skirt rejection. Approximate and exact synthesis techniques are described, including results for the previously neglected odd-degree case.

Intended service is for FDM telephone message service or television relay. The output power is generated in a varactor-tuned oscillator, which is synchronized with a weak input signal using a phase-lock loop. This involves a phase detector and a wide-band direct-coupled video amplifier whose output is applied to the tuning varactor. The paper is largely theoretical, relating the parameters of the feedback loop to the performance of the overall device. Explicit expressions are derived for the noise figure, the frequency response of the modulation characteristic, AM-PM conversion, and nonlinearity effects in terms of differential gain and intermodulation. In addition, two experimental models are described, together with certain measured data. The phase-lock method differs in many ways from multistage reflection amplifiers and appears to offer advantages for many applications. The device has adequate bandwidth and linearity for a single FDM-FM signal with 1800 or more channels, but must be tuned to the intended frequeucy. Tuning procedures are simple. High gain of 25-35 dB is obtainable in a single microwave \"stage.\" Most of this gain may be associated with the functions of phase detection, video amplification, and VCO tuning. Of major importance, with respect to noise, is that the device is functionally equivalent to a high-gain low-noise microwave preamplifier followed by a low-gain power amplifier stage in which the preamplifier has the noise figure of the phase detector combined with the video amplifier, and the power stage has a noise figure appropriate to the class of power diode used. FM noise generation is substantially lower than in a high-gain reflection amplifier using the same class of microwave power diode throughout.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1976.1128866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25030/01128866.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"404","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1976.1128866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Amplification of Microwave FM Communication Signals Using a Phase-Locked Voltage-Tuned Oscillator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1976","displayDocTitle":"Power Amplification of Microwave FM Communication Signals Using a Phase-Locked Voltage-Tuned Oscillator","volume":"24","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jul. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1128866/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Amplification of Microwave FM Communication Signals Using a Phase-Locked Voltage-Tuned Oscillator","sourcePdf":"01128866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042948S","chronDate":"Jul 1976","isNumber":"25030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1128866","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1128873,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This theory is based on the method used in the large-signal theory of noise in IMPATT diode oscillators by the present authors. The theory takes into account the signal dependence of the noise generation in the diode, the noise and/or modulation present in the input signal, and also the intermodulation effects occurring between the various frequency bands. The equations are conveniently arranged in matrix form; such a formulation makes it easier to obtain quantitative results in terms of measurable noise and modulation parameters. Agreement between measured and theoretically predicted AM and FM noise of injection-locked oscillators is good. The usefulness of the theory is illustrated by results of calculations on minimum attainable noise of a given amplifier, maximum noise allowable on the input signal, AM-FM conversion, phase distortion, bias modulation, and the correlation between various types of noise.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1977.1129095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25039/01129095.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"332","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1977.1129095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of Noise and Transfer Properties of IMPATT Diode Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1977","displayDocTitle":"Theory of Noise and Transfer Properties of IMPATT Diode Amplifiers","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Apr. 1977","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1977","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of Noise and Transfer Properties of IMPATT Diode Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01129095.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03225S","chronDate":"Apr 1977","isNumber":"25039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1129095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1129103,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The configuration used to study the maser instability consists of relativistic electrons gyrating about and drifting along a uniform magnetic field within a parallel plate waveguide. Relativistic effects associated with the gyrating electrons are responsible for excitation of the transverse electric mode in the waveguide. Linear theory shows that the growth rate maximizes when the axial beam velocity coincides with the axial wave group velocity of the excited electromagnetic wave. This allows us to perform the nonlinear analysis in a frame where both the axial wave number and axial beam velocity vanish. We have found that the maser instability exists only if the perpendicular beam energy exceeds a threshold value. Our analysis also describes the temporal nonlinear evolution of the field amplitude and frequency of a single excited wave. The nonlinear wave dynamics are self-consistently determined from the nonlinear particle orbits through the force and wave equations. The nonlinear analysis shows that there are two possible mechanisms for the saturation of the unstable wave: 1) depletion of the available free energy associated with the rotating particles and 2) phase trapping of the gyrating electrons in the wave. The initial beam parameters determine which of the two mechanisms is responsible for saturation. Competition between the two saturation mechanisms leads to a peaking in the energy conversion efficiency as a function of beam energy. Numerical results of the nonlinear formalism show that energy conversion efficiencies from the particles to the wave can be as high as 60 percent in the beam frame. Furthermore, by appropriately contouring the external magnetic field, among other things, efficiencies as high as 70 percent can be realized.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrons","Cyclotrons","Masers","Magnetic fields","Electromagnetic waveguides","Energy conversion","Relativistic effects","Beams","Electromagnetic scattering","Performance analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1977.1129151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25041/01129151.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1977.1129151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Linear and Self-Consistent Nonlinear Theory of the Electron Cyclotron Maser Instability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1129151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Linear and Self-Consistent Nonlinear Theory of the Electron Cyclotron Maser Instability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129151/","volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Jun. 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1977","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Linear and Self-Consistent Nonlinear Theory of the Electron Cyclotron Maser Instability","sourcePdf":"01129151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073807S","chronDate":"Jun 1977","isNumber":"25041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"234","articleId":"1129151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1129167,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The problem is formulated in terms of thermoelasticity theory in which the absorbed microwave energy represents the volume heat source which depends on both space and time.

The effect of thickness is formulated to a second-order approximation. Then the result is subjected to numerical differentiation for simple evaluation of the magnetic-loss power factor from the skin depth. The transition formulas are tested against derived formulas for overlapping narrow and wide ranges of shape. Some of these formulas are restated from the earlier derivations and others are derived herein. The latter include the second-order approximation for a narrow thin strip, and a close approximation for a narrow or wide square cross section in comparison with a circular cross section. Graphs are given for practical purposes, showing the wave resistance and magnetic loss for a wide range of shape and dielectric.

Some advantages of the proposed design over existing network analyzer designs are 1) only one source is needed, 2) no phase detectors are required, 3) no flexible cables or arms are used between the reflectometers and the two port being measured, and 4) self-calibration techniques are readily applied.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1977.1129276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25047/01129276.pdf","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1977.1129276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1977","displayDocTitle":"A Network Analyzer Incorporating Two Six-Port Reflectometers","volume":"25","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Dec. 1977","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129276/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Network Analyzer Incorporating Two Six-Port Reflectometers","sourcePdf":"01129276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016048S","chronDate":"Dec 1977","isNumber":"25047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"120","articleId":"1129276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1129303,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

The treatment is general, being independent of the geometrical symmetry of the junction, the number of ports, and the location of the ferrite post inside the junction. The solution of the wave equations in the ferrite post and in the surrounding region is written in the form of an infinite summation of cylindrical modes. The fields at the ferrite-air interface are matched using the point-matching technique. This results in two amplitudes for the cylindrical modes describing the fields in the air region in the form of a matrix. The fields at the arbitrary boundary between the air region and the waveguides are also matched using the point-matching technique. This results in a finite system of nonhomogeneous equations in the field amplitudes. The three-port waveguide junction circulator with central triangular ferrite post is analyzed using this technique. Two specific arrangements are considered. In the first arrangement, the points of the triangles are in the centers of the waveguides, and in the second, the sides of the triangles are in the centers of the waveguides. The method used in this paper can also be applied to study the effect of the ferrite-post geometry on the circulator performance in order to seek the best possible circulator structure. Excellent agreement has been found between published experimental measurements and the numerical results obtained by this technique in the case of a waveguide junction circulator with cylindrical ferrite post.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25051/01129365.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1978.1129365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1978.1129365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25051","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1129365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field Theory Treatment of H - Plane Waveguide Junction with Triangular Ferrite Post","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Waveguide junctions","Waveguide theory","Ferrites","Isolators","Microwave theory and techniques","Admittance measurement","Stripline","Switches","Circuits and systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr.  1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr.  1978","displayDocTitle":"Field Theory Treatment of H - Plane Waveguide Junction with Triangular Ferrite Post","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Apr. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Theory Treatment of H - Plane Waveguide Junction with Triangular Ferrite Post","sourcePdf":"01129365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024932S","chronDate":"Apr.  1978","isNumber":"25051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1129365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1129366,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The circuit has low noise and conversion loss and substantial AM local oscillator noise cancellation.The local oscillator frequency is about half the signal frequency. A novel diode chip, the notch-front diode, which has ohmic contacts on the chip faces adjacent the face containing the diode junctions, was developed for these circuits. The notch-front diode permits the low parasitic reactance of the waveguide diode mount to be achieved in stripline circuits. The best performance for a two-diode subharmonically pumped mixer with notch-front diodes was a 400 K mixer noise temperature, obtained at 98 GHz which is comparable to the best fundamental mixers in this frequency range. The performance over a 47-110-GHz frequency range for this circuit with commercial beam-lead diodes is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1978.1129474","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25057/01129474.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1978.1129474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"706","endPage":"715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subharmonically Pumped Millimeter-Wave Mixers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1129474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1978","displayDocTitle":"Subharmonically Pumped Millimeter-Wave Mixers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129474/","volume":"26","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subharmonically Pumped Millimeter-Wave Mixers","sourcePdf":"01129474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04777S","chronDate":"Oct 1978","isNumber":"25057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"71","articleId":"1129474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1129479,"authors":[{"name":"T.E.

In many laser configurations and integrated optical components, grooves are etched in the planar surface or overlays are deposited on it. The step is an idealization of such discontinuity. In this paper, the problem of an arbitrary large step under multimode excitation is solved by means of a rigorous variational approach. A rapidly converging expression for the scattering matrix of the step is derived, which is analogous to the one previously derived for transverse discontinuities in closed waveguides. Two choices as to the basis functions are compared: one is constituted by optimally scaled Laguerre functions and the other by the surface waves of both slabs complemented by Laguerre functions. Both the electric field and the magnetic field formulations of the problem have been investigated for the TE case. Numerical results are presented for the scattering matrix of the step under monomode and multimode excitation as well as for its radiation pattern. The accuracy and limitations of existing small step approximations are discussed. The technique is applicable to other transverse discontinuities in open structures.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1978.1129479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25057","startPage":"738","endPage":"746","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25057/01129479.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rigorous Analysis of the Step Discontinuity in a Planar Dielectric Waveguide","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1978","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Rigorous Analysis of the Step Discontinuity in a Planar Dielectric Waveguide","publicationDate":"Oct. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rigorous Analysis of the Step Discontinuity in a Planar Dielectric Waveguide","sourcePdf":"01129479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021753S","chronDate":"Oct 1978","isNumber":"25057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"132","articleId":"1129479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1129480,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The three-strip coupler, which was designed and fabricated, achieved 3-dB coupling with a simpler configuration than Lange's interdigitated coupler and with characteristics consistent with calculated data. Coupling as tight as 1.5 dB was achieved by a six-strip coupler which was designed with a part of the ground plane of the microstrip substrate removed. This coupler can be used as the middle part of a three-section coupler for which test data shows a wide range of balanced coupling, from 2.5 to 12 GHz, with a coupling unbalance of less than /spl plusmn/0.6 dB.

It is concluded that a broad-band amplifier like a high-efficiency oscillator should have capacitive circuit impedances and is distinguished from a high-efficiency oscillator principally by the number of important harmonics employed. A smaller number of harnonics for the amplifier can lead to broader bandwidth but lower efficiency. The relative merits of experimental amplifier circuits are discussed. It is shown that coaxial-line circuits employing diode packages with large lead inductances are characterized by harmonic impedances which can have large values over broad frequency bands. However, it is also shown that the device waveforms in this case are excessively degraded and relativeIy low-efficiency results. On the other hand, microstrip circuits with a Iow-impedance diode mount can provide broadband low impedances at both fundamental and third harmonic and have exhibited better performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1979.1129553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25060/01129553.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"31","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1979.1129553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit Behavior and Impedance Characteristics of Broad-Band TRAPATT-Mode Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1979","displayDocTitle":"Circuit Behavior and Impedance Characteristics of Broad-Band TRAPATT-Mode Amplifiers","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit Behavior and Impedance Characteristics of Broad-Band TRAPATT-Mode Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01129553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037447S","chronDate":"Jan 1979","isNumber":"25060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1129553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1129556,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

In the example consided, wave amplification results from the interaction of a TE/sub 01/ waveguide mode with the fundamental cyclotron harmonic of an electron beam. The parameter optimization involves the determination of the point of maximum device efficiency as a function of beam density, beam energy, beam positioning, and external magnetic field for the output power required. An analytical linear theory and a numerical simulation code form the basis of theoretical calculations. As a result of the extensive survey in parameter space, the peak efficiency in the beam frame has been found to exceed 70 percent.

A comparison with traditional reflection-type injection-locked oscillators, in which a signal is injected into the output port of the oscillator, is presented theoretically. It is shown that the Iocking range of transmission types always differs from the reflection type by a factor of G/sub s// G/sub p/ where G/sub s/ represents the maximum stable gain of the two-port oscillator and G/sub p/ represents the square root of the output power ratio of the two ports. Experiments on common-source injection-locked oscillators using GaAs FET chips are described and show that, with transmission types, a 1.8 times wider Iocking range can be obtained than with reflection types. Furthermore, investigation of FM noise for both types of injection revealed lower off-carrier FM noise for transmission types than reflection types, even though the Iocking gain of the transmission types was kept the same as that of reflection types. Thus overall features of transmission-type injection locking were found to be advantageous for FM signal amplification even though there is a minimal power loss at the signal input port.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"May 1979","volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmission-Type Injection Locking of GaAs Schottky-Barrier FET Oscillators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission-Type Injection Locking of GaAs Schottky-Barrier FET Oscillators","sourcePdf":"01129637.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046369S","chronDate":"May 1979","isNumber":"25064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"16","articleId":"1129637","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1129641,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A set of four noise parameters are shown as simple functions of equivalent circuit elements of a GaAs MESFET. Each element is then expressed in a simple analytical form with the geometrical and material parameters of this device. Thus practical expressions for the four noise parameters are developed in terms of the geometrical and material parameters. Among the four noise parameters, the minimum noise figure F/sub min/, and equivalent noise resistance R/sub n/, are considered crucial for broad-band Iow-noise amplifiers. A low R/sub n/ corresponds to less sensitivity to input rnismatch, and can be obtained with a short heavily doped thin active channel. Such a high channel doping-to-thickness (N/a) ratio has a potential of producing high power gain, but is contradictory to obtaining a low F/min/. Therefore, a compromise in choosing N and a is necessary for best overall amplifier performance. Four numerical examples are given to show optimization processes.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1979.1129694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1979.1129694","startPage":"643","endPage":"650","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25066/01129694.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Microwave GaAs MESFET's for Broad-Band Low-Noise Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1979","displayDocTitle":"Design of Microwave GaAs MESFET's for Broad-Band Low-Noise Amplifiers","publicationDate":"Jul. 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"27","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129694/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Microwave GaAs MESFET's for Broad-Band Low-Noise Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01129694.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032619S","chronDate":"Jul 1979","isNumber":"25066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"138","articleId":"1129694","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1129702,"authors":[{"name":"E.F.

Legendre polynomials are used as the basis functions for fields having singularities near the edges, leading to fast convergence to the exact solution. A perturbation technique is combined with the spectral-domain method to evaluate conductor and dielectric losses in microstrip, inverted microstrip, and coupled microstrip in the metallic enclosure. Computations of characteristic impedance and losses incurred in several structures are also presented. Central processing unit (CPU) time on an IBM 360/65 for the zeroth-order approximation ranges from 1 to about 5 s for the whole computation, and increases if higher order of solution is requested for better accuracy. The calculation of attenuation due to conductor losses is found to be particularly sensitive to order of approximation, so that the generally used \"zeroth-order\" solution is inadequate. A user-oriented program package has been written, including options on order of mode, order of solution (i.e., of approximation), impedance, attenuation, and number of substrates. Although written for single or coupled microstrip, the program can be adapted for arbitrary arrangements of thin coplanar conductors.

In Part II, the theory is applied to several practical examples, and computed results are given which show the very different effects of the loop inductance (between the diodes) in balanced and subharmonically pumped mixers. It is also shown that the ideal two-diode mixer using exponential diodes has a multiport noise-equivalent network (attenuator) similar to that of the ideal single-diode mixer.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1979.1129771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25071/01129771.pdf","startPage":"938","endPage":"943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1979.1129771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise and Loss in Balanced and Subharmonically Pumped Mixers: Part I - Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1129771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129771/","displayDocTitle":"Noise and Loss in Balanced and Subharmonically Pumped Mixers: Part I - Theory","volume":"27","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise and Loss in Balanced and Subharmonically Pumped Mixers: Part I - Theory","sourcePdf":"01129771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031553S","chronDate":"Dec.  1979","isNumber":"25071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"74","articleId":"1129771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1129774,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

To obtain useful power levels for proposed free-space microwave power transmission applications, numerous rectifier outputs are interconnected in series and/or parallel to share a common dc load. This work analyzes the resultant efficiency degradation when identical rectifiers operate at different RF power Ievels as caused by the power beam taper. Both a closed-form analytical circuit model and a detailed computer-simulation model are used to obtain the output dc load line of the rectifier. The efficiency degradation is nearly identical with series and parallel combining, and the closed-form analytical model provides results which are similar to the detailed computer-simulation model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Combining in an Array of Microwave Power Rectifiers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1979.1129774","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25071/01129774.pdf","startPage":"958","endPage":"968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1979.1129774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1129774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129774/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1979","displayDocTitle":"Power Combining in an Array of Microwave Power Rectifiers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Dec. 1979","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Combining in an Array of Microwave Power Rectifiers","sourcePdf":"01129774.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040247S","chronDate":"Dec 1979","isNumber":"25071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"75","articleId":"1129774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":1129778,"authors":[{"name":"G.F.

It is based on the partitioning of the circuit into linear and nonlinear subnetworks for which, respectively, frequency-domain and time-domain equations are written. Then, taking into account that the time-domain and frequency-domain representations are related by the Fourier series, the circuit behavior is described by means of a system of nonlinear equations whose unknowns are the harmonic components of the incident waves at all the connections. To overcome the numerical problems arising in the search for the solution of this system when strong nonlinearities are involved, a special step-by-step procedure is adopted. The problem is transformed into the search for the solution of a sequence of well-conditioned systems of equations corresponding to a sequence of well-chosen circuits obtained from the original one through progressive changes of the input signal starting from 0 up to the nominal value. The program which implements the method is also described and the results of the analysis relative to a class-C amplifier are compared with measured values.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and Design of Microwave Class-C Amplifiers through Harmonic Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.1979.1129789","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25071/01129789.pdf","startPage":"1043","endPage":"1051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1979.1129789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1129789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129789/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1979","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and Design of Microwave Class-C Amplifiers through Harmonic Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"Dec. 1979","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and Design of Microwave Class-C Amplifiers through Harmonic Analysis","sourcePdf":"01129789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040057S","chronDate":"Dec 1979","isNumber":"25071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1129789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1129849,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A transistor model is used which enables direct analytical determination of the nonlinear elements from small-signal measurements. The four nonlinearities considered are the gate capacitance, transconductance, drain feedback capacitance, and output conductance. Volterra transfer functions are derived for a simplified model and closed-form expressions for the third-order intermodulation ratio and intercept point are determined. The equations show the dependence of distortion on frequency, terminating impedances, and transistor parameters. Principal sources of distortion are identified and the influence of device parameters and network terminations is investigated. Experimental verification on specific MESFET amplifiers, with 2-mu m and 1-mu m gate devices, comparing predicted and measured intermodulation products for various load conditions is presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1980.1129998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=25073","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel6/22/25073/01129998.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intermodulation Distortion Analysis of MESFET Amplifiers Using the Volterra Series Representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1129998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1980","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Intermodulation Distortion Analysis of MESFET Amplifiers Using the Volterra Series Representation","publicationDate":"Jan. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intermodulation Distortion Analysis of MESFET Amplifiers Using the Volterra Series Representation","sourcePdf":"01129998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035757S","chronDate":"Jan 1980","isNumber":"25073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"100","articleId":"1129998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
