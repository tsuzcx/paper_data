Due to more sensitive hearing and touch, for visually impaired people, it is an available solution to improve their quality of live, work and study by Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs) which transfer visual information to audio or touch. In this paper, we proposed a wearable, vision-to-audio sensory substitution system with scene-perception-based deep learning to help the visually impaired users recognize and locate normal objects in the environment. The system consists of a wireless camera module, a Bluetooth speech feedback module with a microphone, and an Android mobile phone with a customized application. The camera module captures images from the scene and sends them to the application of Android mobile phone. The Bluetooth speech feedback module sends speech commands to application and broadcasts speech guidance to visually impaired users. The application based on Android platform loads speech recognition and object detection models. The system has been proved to provide an effective way to help the visually impaired people recognize and locate objects.","doi":"10.1109/DSInS54396.2021.9670599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSInS54396.2021.9670599","startPage":"283","endPage":"286","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Digital Society and Intelligent Systems (DSInS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9670450/9670553/09670599.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Digital Society and Intelligent Systems (DSInS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9670553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wearable Vision-To-Audio Sensory Substitution System Based on Deep Learning for the Visually Impaired","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Dec. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Wearable Vision-To-Audio Sensory Substitution System Based on Deep Learning for the Visually Impaired","conferenceDate":"3-4 Dec. 2021","publicationDate":"3 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2022","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9670599/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9670599/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wearable Vision-To-Audio Sensory Substitution System Based on Deep Learning for the Visually Impaired","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"54396_ART283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061593S","chronDate":"3-4 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9670450","isNumber":"9670553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9670450","xplore-issue":"9670553","articleId":"9670599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9670602,"authors":[{"name":"Hafsa Yousif","affiliation":["School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu"],"firstName":"Hafsa","lastName":"Yousif"},{"name":"Isselmou Abd El Kader","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology"],"firstName":"Isselmou Abd","lastName":"El Kader"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0630-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0629-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0631-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9670602","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Gender face recognition has several useful applications in human Android reactions, in which the overall user experience can improved.

Existing DL-based MIMO detectors, however, suffer several drawbacks. To address these issues, in this paper, we develop a model-driven DL detector based on variational Bayesian inference. Specifically, the proposed unrolled DL architecture is inspired by an inverse-free variational Bayesian learning framework which circumvents matrix inversion via maximizing a relaxed evidence lower bound. Two networks are respectively developed for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian channels and arbitrarily correlated channels. The proposed networks, referred to as VBINet, have only a few learnable parameters and thus can be efficiently trained with a moderate amount of training samples. The proposed VBINet-based detectors can work in both offline and online training modes. An important advantage of our proposed networks over state-of-the-art MIMO detection networks such as OAMPNet and MMNet is that the VBINet can automatically learn the noise variance from data, thus yielding a significant performance improvement over the OAMPNet and MMNet in the presence of noise variance uncertainty. Simulation results show that the proposed VBINet-based detectors achieve competitive performance for both i.i.d. Gaussian and realistic 3GPP MIMO channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9672704/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2022","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9672704/","displayDocTitle":"A Variational Bayesian Inference-Inspired Unrolled Deep Network for MIMO Detection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61829103 and 61871421"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Variational Bayesian Inference-Inspired Unrolled Deep Network for MIMO Detection","sourcePdf":"tsp-fang-3140926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117358S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9672704","onlineDate":"06 January 2022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9672723,"authors":[{"name":"Tin Vla\u0161i\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems and Information Processing, University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Zagreb, Croatia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9672723/vlasi-3141009-small.gif","p":["Tin Vla\u0161i\u0107 (Student Member, IEEE) was born in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1993.

We reinterpret the random demodulator, a system that acquires sparse bandlimited signals, as a system for the acquisition of linear combinations of the samples in the SI setting with the box function as the sampling kernel. The sparsity assumption is exploited by the compressive sensing (CS) paradigm for a recovery of the SI samples from a reduced set of measurements. The SI samples are subsequently filtered by a discrete-time correction filter to reconstruct expansion coefficients of the observed signal. Furthermore, we offer a generalization of the proposed framework to other compactly supported sampling kernels that span a wider class of SI spaces. The generalized method embeds the correction filter in the CS optimization problem which directly reconstructs expansion coefficients of the signal. Both approaches recast an inherently continuous-domain inverse problem in a set of finite-dimensional CS problems in an exact way. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on signals in polynomial B-spline spaces whose expansion coefficients are assumed to be sparse in a certain transform domain. The coefficients can be regarded as parametric models of an underlying continuous-time signal, obtained from a reduced set of measurements. Such continuous signal representations are particularly suitable for signal processing without converting them into samples.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2022.3141009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

The input signal of a Wiener filter is one-dimensional while its associated least-squares solution, namely Wiener-Hopf equation, involves a two-dimensional data-array, or correlation matrix. However, the actual match should often be carried out between a multi-dimensional filtered signal-sequence, which is the output of a multi-channel filter characterized as a linear-time-invariant MIMO (multi-input and multi-output) system, and a multi-dimensional desired signal-sequence simultaneously. In the presence of such a multi-channel filter, the solution to the corresponding Wiener filter, which we call MIMO Wiener-Hopf equation now, involves a correlation tensor. Therefore, we call this optimal multi-channel filter Tensor Wiener Filter (TWF). Due to lack of the pertinent mathematical framework of needed tensor operations, TWF has never been investigated so far. Now we would like to make the first-ever attempt to establish a new mathematical framework for TWF, which relies on the inverse of the correlation tensor. We propose the new parallel block-Jacobi tensor-inversion algorithm for this tensor inversion. A typical application of the new TWF approach is illustrated as a multi-channel linear predictor (MCLP) built upon a multi-channel autoregressive (MCAR) filter with multi-dimensional input data. Numerical experiments pertaining to seismic data, optical images, and macroeconomic time-series are conducted in comparison with other existing methods. The memory- and computational-complexities corresponding to our proposed parallel block-Jacobi tensor-inversion algorithm are also studied in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2022.3140722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2022.3140722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","startPage":"410","endPage":"422","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09674807.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9674807","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensors","Wiener filters","Optical filters","MIMO communication","Mathematical models","Signal processing algorithms","Filtering algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tensor Wiener filter (TWF)","linear network of filters","multi-channel linear predictor (MCLP)","MIMO (multiinput and multi-output) Wiener-Hopf equation","tensor inverse","multi-channel autoregressive (MCAR) filter","parallel block-Jacobi tensor-inversion algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tensor Wiener Filter","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9674807/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9674807/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Louisiana Board of Regents Research Competitiveness Subprogram","grantNumber":"LEQSF(2021-22)-RD-A-34"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor Wiener Filter","sourcePdf":"tsp-wu-3140722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099428S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9674807","onlineDate":"07 January 2022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9674840,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhe Fan","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, the School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9674840/fan-3141254-small.gif","p":["Wenzhe Fan (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2017.

In this paper, we consider the joint estimation of signal amplitude and background noise variance from binary observations over decentralized channels. We first analyze the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) of the parameters of interest and develop a quasilinear estimator (QLE), in which the desirable estimates can be obtained from several intermediate parameters linearly. Next, we consider a more realistic situation where the decentralized channel is noisy during the data transmission. Based on the error propagation model, the asymptotic analysis shows that the performance of the proposed QLE is mainly dominated by the thresholds of the quantizers, which encourages us to adopt a correlated quantization (CQ) scheme by exploiting the spatial correlation among background noises/channel noises. To ease the implementation of QLE in practice, an adaptive quantization (AQ) scheme is also proposed so as to obtain reasonable selections of the required thresholds. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate our theoretical findings.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2022.3141254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09674840.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2022.3141254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9674840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Parameter Estimation From Binary Observations Over Decentralized Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Parameter Estimation From Binary Observations Over Decentralized Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9674840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2022","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9674840/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61720106003, 61771124 and 62171119"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Parameter Estimation From Binary Observations Over Decentralized Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-huang-3141254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100376S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9674840","onlineDate":"07 January 2022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9674907,"authors":[{"name":"Bhekisizwe Mthethwa","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9668973/9674907/mthet-3141626-small.gif","p":["Bhekisizwe Mthethwa received the B.Sc.Eng. and M.Sc.Eng.

We define the high-density M-QAM as having modulation orders (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n) of at least 64, i.e. \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M\\ge 64. $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n High-density M-QAM symbols deliver high data rates under good wireless channels. Future wireless systems must deliver high data rates and simultaneously low end-to-end latency. However, higher M-QAM modulation orders increase the Golden code SD search breadth, thus increasing decoding latency. We, therefore, propose two forms of low complexity Golden code SD to achieve low decoding latency while maintaining the near-optimal SD bit-error rate (BER). The proposed low complexity SD algorithms are based on the SD with sorted detection subsets (SD-SDS). The literature shows the SD-SDS to achieve lower detection complexity relative to the Schnorr-Euchner SD (SE-SD). The first form of the proposed Golden code SD is the SD-SDS-Descend algorithm with instantaneously varying subset lengths and a search tree search order sorted based on the worst-first search strategy. The second form of the proposed Golden code SD is an SD-SDS algorithm called SD-SDS-ES-DNN with a deep learning-based early stopping search criterion. Our proposed algorithms achieve at most 57% and 70% reduction in Golden code decoding latency relative to SD-SDS, at low SNR, for 64-QAM and 256-QAM, respectively. At high SNR, the proposed algorithms achieve 40% and 37% in Golden code decoding latency reduction relative to the SD-SDS for 64-QAM and 256-QAM, respectively. The decoding latency reduction is achieved while maintaining near-optimal BER performances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9674907/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2022","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"10","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9674907/","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Golden Code Analytical and Deep Learning-Based Sphere-Decoders for High-Density M-QAM","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UKZN CRART Centre"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Low Complexity Golden Code Analytical and Deep Learning-Based Sphere-Decoders for High-Density M-QAM","sourcePdf":"access-mthethwa-3141626-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118967S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9668973","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9668973","articleId":"9674907","onlineDate":"07 January 2022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9674972,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Wu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37089245051"},{"name":"Neng Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Neng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37089247245"},{"name":"Ye Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088404296"},{"name":"Liang Chang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085833533"},{"name":"Liang Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086670423"},{"name":"Jun Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37897473800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-9575-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-9574-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-9576-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9674972","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Computational modeling","Optimization methods","Feature extraction","Software","Convolutional neural networks","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","hardware accelerator","artificial intelligence & internet of things","edge computing"]}],"abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (hereafter CNN) have been widely used in the Artificial Intelligence & Internet of Things (AIoT) applications, due to its powerful feature extraction and classification capabilities.

Wireless communication using radio frequency (RF) radiation has been around for over 100 years and has shaped our society significantly over the past 40 years. However, wireless is not just about communications. For very short ranges, wireless power supply by inductive power transfer has become a reality through several commercial products and standards (Wireless Power Consortium, Power Matters Alliance, Alliance for Wireless Power, and Rezence). Far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) and wireless energy harvesting (WEH) via RF (as in wireless communications) on the other hand could be used for a longer range. Although it has long been seen as a potential for powering low-power devices, it is only recently that wireless (via RF) power has been recognized as a promising technology to cope with the explosion of low-power devices in future networks. Driven by the reduction in the energy needs of electronic devices (remember Koomey\u2019s law according to which, in 20 years, a device will require 10 000 times less energy to compute a given task) and the advent of trillions of internet device objects [Internet of Things (IoT)], there is a need to rethink the design of the network of the future so that wireless can reach its full potential not only to carry information but also to transfer energy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Special issues and sections","Radio frequency","Wireless sensor transfer","Energy harvesting","Power supplies","Power supplies","Electric potential","Internet of Things"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2021.3133676","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/9675003/09675010.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2021.3133676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Future Networks With Wireless Power Transfer and Energy Harvesting [Scanning the Issue]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9675010","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Future Networks With Wireless Power Transfer and Energy Harvesting [Scanning the Issue]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9675010/","volume":"110","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9675010/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Future Networks With Wireless Power Transfer and Energy Harvesting [Scanning the Issue]","sourcePdf":"jproc-clerckx-3133676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024665S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"9675003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","xplore-issue":"9675003","articleId":"9675010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9675011,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Clerckx","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/9675003/9675011/clerc-3132369-small.gif","p":["Bruno Clerckx (Senior Member, IEEE) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","From 2006 to 2011, he was with Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea, where he actively contributed to 4G (3GPP LTE/LTE-A and IEEE 802.16m) and acted as the Rapporteur for the 3GPP Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) Study Item.

Future wireless networks will be equipped with (radiative) wireless power transfer (WPT) capability and exploit radio waves to carry both energy and information through unified wireless information and power transfer (WIPT). Such networks will make the best use of the RF spectrum and radiation, as well as the network infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. Consequently, those networks will enable trillions of future low-power devices to sense, compute, connect, and energize anywhere, anytime, and on the move. In this article, we review the foundations of such a future system. We first give an overview of the fundamental theoretical building blocks of WPT and WIPT. Then, we discuss some state-of-the-art experimental setups and prototypes of both WPT and WIPT, and contrast theoretical and experimental results. We draw special attention to how the integration of RF, signal, and system designs in WPT and WIPT leads to new theoretical and experimental design challenges for both microwave and communication engineers and highlight some promising solutions. Topics and experimental testbeds discussed include closed-loop WPT and WIPT architectures with beamforming, waveform, channel acquisition, and single-antenna/multiantenna energy harvester, centralized and distributed WPT, reconfigurable metasurfaces and intelligent surfaces for WPT, transmitter and receiver architecture for WIPT, modulation, and rate\u2013energy tradeoff.

Unlike classical fixed-lag techniques that only approximate certain marginals, we introduce an online resampling algorithm, called \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">particle stitching</i>\n, that converts these marginal samples into a full posterior approximation. We demonstrate the utility of our method in the context of map-matching, the task of inferring a vehicle\u2019s trajectory given a road network and noisy GPS observations. We develop a new state-space model for the difficult task of map-matching on dense, urban road networks.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2022.3141259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2022.3141259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","startPage":"497","endPage":"508","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09676428.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9676428","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Approximation algorithms","State-space methods","Additives","Trajectory","Signal processing algorithms","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["State-space models","sequential Monte Carlo","particle smoothing","backward simulation","map-matching","GPS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Online Particle Smoothing With Application to Map-Matching","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9676428/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9676428/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Doctoral Training Award","grantNumber":"RGS3167"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Particle Smoothing With Application to Map-Matching","sourcePdf":"tsp-duffield-3141259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074815S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9676428","onlineDate":"10 January 2022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"}]
