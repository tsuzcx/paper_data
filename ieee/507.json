Hence, different initializations may lead to different results. The important issue is how to avoid getting a bad local minimum value to improve the cluster accuracy. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a popular and robust strategy for optimization problems. But the main difficulty in applying PSO to real-world applications is that PSO usually need a large number of fitness evaluations before a satisfying result can be obtained. In this paper, the improved new algorithm, ldquoFuzzy C-Mean based on Picard iteration and PSO (PPSO-FCM)rdquo, is proposed.

SQL injection (SQLI) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are widespread forms of attack in which the attacker crafts the input to the application to access or modify user data and execute malicious code. In the most serious attacks (called second-order, or persistent, XSS), an attacker can corrupt a database so as to cause subsequent users to execute malicious code. This paper presents an automatic technique for creating inputs that expose SQLI and XSS vulnerabilities. The technique generates sample inputs, symbolically tracks taints through execution (including through database accesses), and mutates the inputs to produce concrete exploits. Ours is the first analysis of which we are aware that precisely addresses second-order XSS attacks. Our technique creates real attack vectors, has few false positives, incurs no runtime overhead for the deployed application, works without requiring modification of application code, and handles dynamic programming-language constructs. We implemented the technique for PHP, in a tool ARDILLA. We evaluated ARDILLA on five PHP applications and found 68 previously unknown vulnerabilities (23 SQLI, 33 first-order XSS, and 12 second-order XSS).","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070521","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 31st International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 31st International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5062304/5070493/05070521.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5070493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic creation of SQL Injection and cross-site scripting attacks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5070521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5070521/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic creation of SQL Injection and cross-site scripting attacks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10699566","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5070521/","conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic creation of SQL Injection and cross-site scripting attacks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078178S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5062304","isNumber":"5070493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5062304","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"5070493","articleId":"5070521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5070524,"authors":[{"name":"Emily Hill","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Hill","id":"37314637800"},{"name":"Lori Pollock","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Lori","lastName":"Pollock","id":"37264940900"},{"name":"K.

Existing static code search techniques using natural language queries provide little support to help developers determine whether search results are relevant, and few recommend alternative words to help developers reformulate poor queries. In this paper, we present a novel approach that automatically extracts natural language phrases from source code identifiers and categorizes the phrases and search results in a hierarchy. Our contextual search approach allows developers to explore the word usage in a piece of software, helping them to quickly identify relevant program elements for investigation or to quickly recognize alternative words for query reformulation. An empirical evaluation of 22 developers reveals that our contextual search approach significantly outperforms the most closely related technique in terms of effort and effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070524","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 31st International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 31st International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5062304/5070493/05070524.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5070493","startPage":"232","endPage":"242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatically capturing source code context of NL-queries for software maintenance and reuse","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5070524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatically capturing source code context of NL-queries for software maintenance and reuse","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5070524/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10699569","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5070524/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatically capturing source code context of NL-queries for software maintenance and reuse","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056793S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5062304","isNumber":"5070493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5062304","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5070493","articleId":"5070524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5070529,"authors":[{"name":"Emerson Murphy-Hill","affiliation":["Portland State University, USA"],"firstName":"Emerson","lastName":"Murphy-Hill","id":"38330554900"},{"name":"Chris Parnin","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Parnin","id":"37312438600"},{"name":"Andrew P.

Researchers have rarely taken the time to replicate these studies in other contexts or to examine the assumptions on which they are based. To help put refactoring research on a sound scientific basis, we draw conclusions using four data sets spanning more than 13 000 developers, 240 000 tool-assisted refactorings, 2500 developer hours, and 3400 version control commits. Using these data, we cast doubt on several previously stated assumptions about how programmers refactor, while validating others. For example, we find that programmers frequently do not indicate refactoring activity in commit logs, which contradicts assumptions made by several previous researchers. In contrast, we were able to confirm the assumption that programmers do frequently intersperse refactoring with other program changes. By confirming assumptions and replicating studies made by other researchers, we can have greater confidence that those researchers' conclusions are generalizable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5070529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10699574","htmlLink":"/document/5070529/","conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"How we refactor, and how we know it","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How we refactor, and how we know it","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059512S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5062304","isNumber":"5070493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5062304","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"5070493","articleId":"5070529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5070536,"authors":[{"name":"Westley Weimer","affiliation":["University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Westley","lastName":"Weimer","id":"37312553000"},{"name":"ThanhVu Nguyen","affiliation":["University of New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"ThanhVu","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37311047500"},{"name":"Claire Le Goues","affiliation":["University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Claire","lastName":"Le Goues","id":"37085783283"},{"name":"Stephanie Forrest","affiliation":["University of New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Forrest","id":"37288742600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3453-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"5070536","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":299,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic programming","Computer bugs","Testing","Biology computing","Genetic mutations","Debugging","Formal specifications","Software maintenance","Costs","Biological information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","program debugging","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patches","genetic programming","automatic program repair","software engineering","off-the-shelf legacy applications","program fault discovery","structural differencing algorithms","delta debugging","C programs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5070536","abstract":"Automatic program repair has been a longstanding goal in software engineering, yet debugging remains a largely manual process. We introduce a fully automated method for locating and repairing bugs in software.

Once a program fault is discovered, an extended form of genetic programming is used to evolve program variants until one is found that both retains required functionality and also avoids the defect in question. Standard test cases are used to exercise the fault and to encode program requirements. After a successful repair has been discovered, it is minimized using structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging. We describe the proposed method and report experimental results demonstrating that it can successfully repair ten different C programs totaling 63,000 lines in under 200 seconds, on average.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070536","startPage":"364","endPage":"374","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 31st International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5062304/5070493/05070536.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 31st International Conference on Software Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5070493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatically finding patches using genetic programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automatically finding patches using genetic programming","conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5070536/","accessionNumber":"10699581","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5070536/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatically finding patches using genetic programming","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079242S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5062304","isNumber":"5070493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5062304","citationCount":"299","xplore-issue":"5070493","articleId":"5070536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":5070546,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Ganesh","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Ganesh","id":"37311760700"},{"name":"Tim Leek","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Leek","id":"37284445500"},{"name":"Martin Rinard","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Rinard","id":"37283976600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3453-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"5070546","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1066},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","Automatic testing","Character generation","Law","Legal factors","Instruments","Computer science","Artificial intelligence","Laboratories","Open source software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program debugging","program testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["taint-based directed whitebox fuzzing","BuzzFuzz","dynamic taint tracing","Swfdec","MuPDF"]}],"abstract":"We present a new automated white box fuzzing technique and a tool, BuzzFuzz, that implements this technique. Unlike standard fuzzing techniques, which randomly change parts of the input file with little or no information about the underlying syntactic structure of the file, BuzzFuzz uses dynamic taint tracing to automatically locate regions of original seed input files that influence values used at key program attack points (points where the program may contain an error). BuzzFuzz then automatically generates new fuzzed test input files by fuzzing these identified regions of the original seed input files. Because these new test files typically preserve the underlying syntactic structure of the original seed input files, they tend to make it past the initial input parsing components to exercise code deep within the semantic core of the computation. We have used BuzzFuzz to automatically find errors in two open-source applications: Swfdec (an Adobe Flash player) and MuPDF (a PDF viewer). Our results indicate that our new directed fuzzing technique can effectively expose errors located deep within large programs. Because the directed fuzzing technique uses taint to automatically discover and exploit information about the input file format, it is especially appropriate for testing programs that have complex, highly structured input file formats.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 31st International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 31st International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5062304/5070493/05070546.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Taint-based directed whitebox fuzzing","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5070493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5070546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5070546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Taint-based directed whitebox fuzzing","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10699591","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5070546/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Taint-based directed whitebox fuzzing","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050566S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5062304","isNumber":"5070493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5062304","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5070493","articleId":"5070546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5070705,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelwahab Hamou-Lhadj","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdelwahab","lastName":"Hamou-Lhadj","id":"37282690000"},{"name":"Abdelouahed Gherbi","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdelouahed","lastName":"Gherbi","id":"37313106000"},{"name":"Jagadeesh Nandigam","affiliation":["Grand Valley State University, Allendale, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Jagadeesh","lastName":"Nandigam","id":"37295994100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3770-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3596-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5070705","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1006},"abstract":"As businesses rely on software solutions to preserve their position in a highly competitive market, the need for reliable and robust software systems is vital. Lately, there has been a significant interest in building software using models as their main artifacts. Unlike traditional development techniques which tend to be code-centric, model driven approaches, such as the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) standard, stress the usage of models at all levels of the software development life-cycle. The MDA, which is supported by the Object Management Group (OMG), is based on a comprehensive set of standards including MOF, UML, and OCL, to mention a few. This paradigm shift in software engineering has impacted not only the way software is built but also the way software engineering is being taught - The standards introduce a significant body of knowledge that should be integrated in a software engineering curriculum. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the model-driven software engineering approach on software education. This discussion is based on an experience teaching a graduate course on model-driven software engineering at Concordia University.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software engineering","Software standards","Robustness","Software systems","Buildings","Computer architecture","Code standards","Standards development","Stress","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer science education","distributed object management","educational courses","educational institutions","object-oriented programming","software architecture","Unified Modeling Language"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven approach","software engineering education","software systems","development techniques","code-centric","model driven architecture standard","software development life-cycle","Object Management Group","MOF","UML","OCL","software engineering curriculum","graduate course","model-driven software engineering","Concordia University"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model-driven software engineering","software engineering education","model-driven architecture (MDA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITNG.2009.160","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations","pdfPath":"/iel5/5070574/5070575/05070705.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5070575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITNG.2009.160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of the Model-Driven Approach to Software Engineering on Software Engineering Education","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5070705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of the Model-Driven Approach to Software Engineering on Software Engineering Education","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5070705/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5070705/","accessionNumber":"10700137","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of the Model-Driven Approach to Software Engineering on Software Engineering Education","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"3596a719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053357S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5070574","isNumber":"5070575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5070574","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5070575","articleId":"5070705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5070730,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280760400"},{"name":"Jianye Hao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jianye","lastName":"Hao","id":"37310824100"},{"name":"Feixuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Feixuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37309002500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3770-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3596-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5070730","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Emulation","Performance analysis","Topology","Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Costs","Integrated circuit technology","Very large scale integration","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","network routing","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bus-based infrastructure","NoC infrastructure performance emulation","FPGA","field programmable gate array","inner latency performance","network routing","spidernet-based infrastructure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NoC","Spidernet","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study and compare the performance of bus-based and mesh-based with spidernet NoC-based infrastructure in Alterapsilas FPGA.

Current research is investigating the possibility of symmetric DSL at 1 Gbps (GDSL). This paper addresses the design, as well as a feasibility study, of a complete complementary multi-carrier code-division multiple access (CC-MC-CDMA) transceiver system. This fully functional modem combines the virtues of both orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and conventional code division multiple access (CDMA) to support many users simultaneously with higher spectral efficiencies than conventional CDMA systems and better noise tolerance than existing DSL solutions. We also determine the capacity of the CC-MC-CDMA system.","doi":"10.1109/ITNG.2009.30","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations","pdfPath":"/iel5/5070574/5070575/05070735.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITNG.2009.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5070575","startPage":"883","endPage":"888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a CC-MC-CDMA System for Gigabit DSL (GDSL)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5070735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a CC-MC-CDMA System for Gigabit DSL (GDSL)","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5070735/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700167","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5070735/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a CC-MC-CDMA System for Gigabit DSL (GDSL)","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"3596a883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046899S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5070574","isNumber":"5070575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5070574","xplore-issue":"5070575","articleId":"5070735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5070781,"authors":[{"name":"Dongho Lim","affiliation":["Yeungnam University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongho","lastName":"Lim","id":"37307047500"},{"name":"Kwonhue Choi","affiliation":["Yeungnam University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwonhue","lastName":"Choi","id":"38559978700"},{"name":"Huaping Liu","affiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"],"firstName":"Huaping","lastName":"Liu","id":"37310126400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3770-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3596-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5070781","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna feeds","Large-scale systems","Fading","Rayleigh channels","Delay","Feedback loop","Bit error rate","Degradation","Time varying systems","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed antenna systems","large-scale fading-only feedback","optimum power allocation scheme","time-varying Rayleigh fading channel","Ricean fading channel","channel state information","Doppler","feedback loop delay","distributed base stations","line-of-sight component"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DAS","Optimum Power Allocation","Large-scale fading","Time-varying fading"]}],"abstract":"We propose an optimum power allocation scheme for distributed antenna systems (DAS) in time-varying Rayleigh and Ricean fading channels. In the conventional power allocation schemes for DAS, channel state information (CSI) for feedback includes the fast small-scale fading. This causes two practical problems. First, tracking fast fading requires considerable extra bandwidth and processing, which becomes even larger as the number of the distributed antennas increases. Secondly, there is non-negligible power control latency due to the high Doppler of small-scale fading and the feedback loop delay. In this paper, we consider a DAS system which determines the transmission power at each distributed base stations (antennas) only based on the slowly varying large-scale fading excluding the fast small-scale fading and we derive the optimum power allocation (PA) rule for minimum BER under total power constraint. In case of even small variation in fast fading during feedback loop delay, the conventional optimum PA scheme, which includes fast small-scale fading in CSI feedback, degrades significantly and the proposed scheme achieves much lower bit error rates. Even in the case with no latency, the proposed scheme loses only about 1 dB SNR compared to the optimum scheme, which includes fast fading feedback. Finally, though the proposed power allocation formula is derived assuming Rayleigh fading, we show that it can be employed to Ricean fading channels with a small line-of-sight (LOS) component with a negligible degradation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Power Allocation for Distributed Antenna Systems with Large-scale Fading-only Feedback","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations","doi":"10.1109/ITNG.2009.309","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations","pdfPath":"/iel5/5070574/5070575/05070781.pdf","startPage":"1158","endPage":"1164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITNG.2009.309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5070575","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5070781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5070781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Power Allocation for Distributed Antenna Systems with Large-scale Fading-only Feedback","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5070781/","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700213","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Power Allocation for Distributed Antenna Systems with Large-scale Fading-only Feedback","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"3596b158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070855S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5070574","isNumber":"5070575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5070574","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5070575","articleId":"5070781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5070800,"authors":[{"name":"Babak Abbasi Bastami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, USA"],"firstName":"Babak Abbasi","lastName":"Bastami","id":"37313775000"},{"name":"Ebrahim Saberinia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, USA"],"firstName":"Ebrahim","lastName":"Saberinia","id":"37271585400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3770-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3596-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5070800","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Interference","Closed-form solution","Information technology","Computer errors","Computer simulation","Radio frequency","Wireless sensor networks","Measurement units","Licenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmission time","secondary user","overlay cognitive radio system","optimal opportunistic channel access","unlicensed users","Markov model","error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Overlay system","Interference analysis","imperfect sensing"]}],"abstract":"Optimal Opportunistic channel access of the unlicensed users has been a major problem in a cognitive radio system.

We derive closed-form expressions for the interference at the primary receiver side and the achievable data rate of the secondary user.

The agglutinative nature of Turkish leads to a high number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words which in turn lower automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. This situation compromises the performance of speech retrieval systems based on ASR output. Therefore using a word-based ASR is not adequate for transcribing speech in Turkish. To alleviate this problem, various sub-word-based recognition units are utilized. These units solve the OOV problem with moderate size vocabularies and perform even better than a 500 K word vocabulary as far as recognition accuracy is concerned. As a novel approach, the interaction between recognition units, words and sub-words, and discriminative training is explored. Sub-word models benefit from discriminative training more than word models do, especially in the discriminative language modeling framework. For speech retrieval, a spoken term detection system based on automata indexation is utilized. As with transcription, retrieval performance is measured under various schemes incorporating words and sub-words. Best results are obtained using a cascade of word and sub-word indexes together with term-specific thresholding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turkish Broadcast News Transcription and Retrieval","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.2012313","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5067414/05071138.pdf","startPage":"874","endPage":"883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.2012313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067414","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071138/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Turkish Broadcast News Transcription and Retrieval","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5071138/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10718638","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turkish Broadcast News Transcription and Retrieval","sourcePdf":"17tasl03-earisoy-2012313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190693S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5067414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5067414","articleId":"5071138","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071143,"authors":[{"name":"Mikkel C.

Based on the well-known combination of an envelope tracking (ET) power supply and a linear class-A/B RFPA, adequate adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and wideband noise performance is shown to be enabled only by further incorporating high-bandwidth Cartesian feedback (CFB) and using a low-noise ET power supply. It is demonstrated that CFB loop bandwidth is limited by modulator/demodulator/RF path group delay to around 2 MHz in the considered setup, and that there exists a significant tradeoff between the depth of the ET and open-loop RFPA linearity, as well as overall efficiency. An empirical method for determining the permissible amount of switching ripple on the ET supply is presented, showing very good accuracy.

The measurements were performed considering over thirty on-body links in the front of human body in the anechoic chamber, and in indoor environment. Two different pairs of planar antennas have been used, namely, CPW-fed planar inverted cone antennas (PICA), and miniaturized CPW-fed tapered slot antennas (TSA). A path loss model is extracted from measured data, and a statistical study is performed on the time delay parameters. The goodness of different statistical models in fitting the root mean square (RMS) delay has been evaluated. Results demonstrate that the TSA, due to its more directive radiation behavior is less affected from the reflections from body parts and surrounding environment. The antenna shows significant size reduction and improved time delay behavior, and hence is an ideal candidate for UWB body area networks (BAN).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11069034","htmlLink":"/document/5071156/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Characterization of UWB On-Body Radio Channel in Indoor Environment Considering Different Antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Characterization of UWB On-Body Radio Channel in Indoor Environment Considering Different Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-yhao-2024969.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052676S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5371803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5371803","articleId":"5071156","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5071163,"authors":[{"name":"Juhoon Back","affiliation":["Department of Information and Control Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Juhoon","lastName":"Back","id":"37300771500"},{"name":"Hyungbo Shim","affiliation":["ASRI, School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyungbo","lastName":"Shim","id":"37278033400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"5071163","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":985},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Robust control","MIMO","Nonlinear systems","Sliding mode control","Centralized control","Uncertainty","Robust stability","Control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","MIMO systems","multivariable control systems","nonlinear control systems","singularly perturbed systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inner-loop controller","robust transient performance","uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems","output-feedback controller","closed-loop system","disturbance-free nominal plant","single-input-single-output nonlinear systems","multi-input-multi-output nonlinear systems","singular perturbation theory","multivariable circle criterion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-input-multi-output (MIMO)","performance recovery","robust control","singular perturbation"]}],"abstract":"An output-feedback controller has been recently proposed that has the following features: 1) it is an inner-loop controller so that it can be added on the existing closed-loop system working in harmony with a pre-designed (possibly non-robust) outer-loop controller; 2) it robustifies the closed-loop system in a way that the uncertain plant under external disturbance behaves like a disturbance-free nominal plant; and 3) it recovers the trajectory of the nominal closed-loop system in time domain.

However, the large increase of process variations in advanced CMOS technologies is considered one of the biggest challenges for SRAM designers. In the presence of large process variations, SRAMs are expected to consume larger power to ensure correct read operations and meet yield targets. In this paper, we propose a new architecture that significantly reduces the array switching power for SRAM. The proposed architecture combines built-in self-test and digitally controlled delay elements to reduce the wordline pulsewidth for memories while ensuring correct read operations, hence reducing the switching power. Monte Carlo simulations using a 1-Mb SRAM macro in an industrial 45-nm technology are used to verify the power saving for the proposed architecture. For a 48-Mb memory density, a 27% reduction in array switching power can be achieved for a read access yield target of 95%. In addition, the proposed system can provide larger power saving as process variations increase, which makes it an attractive solution for 45-nm-and-below technologies.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2012511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5419135/05071192.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2012511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing SRAM Power Using Fine-Grained Wordline Pulsewidth Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071192/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Reducing SRAM Power Using Fine-Grained Wordline Pulsewidth Control","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142348","htmlLink":"/document/5071192/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing SRAM Power Using Fine-Grained Wordline Pulsewidth Control","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-abu-rahma-2012511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132751S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5419135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5419135","articleId":"5071192","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5071198,"authors":[{"name":"Leilei Li","affiliation":["SARFT, Academy of Broadcasting Planning, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5353758/5071198/5071198-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leilei Li (S'08\u2013M'09) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Communication University of China, Beijing, China, the M.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, U.K., in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K., in 2009.","From 2002 to 2004, he worked in the China Centre Television (CCTV) Station and joined the technology design team for the CCTV new building, as an Engineer.

The analysis of transient and steady-state performances at each individual node within the network is developed by using a weighted spatial-temporal energy conservation relation and confirmed by computer simulations. The simulation results also verify that the proposed algorithm provides not only a faster convergence rate but also an improved steady-state performance as compared to an LMS-based scheme. In addition, the new approach attains an acceptable misadjustment performance with lower computational and memory cost, provided the number of regressor vectors and filter length parameters are appropriately chosen, as compared to a distributed recursive-least-squares (RLS) based method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05071198.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Estimation Over an Adaptive Incremental Network Based on the Affine Projection Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Projection algorithms","Transient analysis","Steady-state","Newton method","Cost function","Least squares approximation","Adaptive filters","Performance analysis","Energy conservation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","affine transforms","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine projection algorithm","distributed estimation","Newton method","least mean square","distributed adaptive filters","weighted spatial-temporal energy conservation relation","recursive least square method","adaptive incremental network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filters","affine projection algorithm","distributed estimation","energy conversation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Estimation Over an Adaptive Incremental Network Based on the Affine Projection Algorithm","volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5071198/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020519","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Estimation Over an Adaptive Incremental Network Based on the Affine Projection Algorithm","sourcePdf":"57tsp10-lli-2025074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0862S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5071198","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071202,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Paul M.

To enable easy user interaction with a future lighting system consisting of many LEDs, this paper proposes a method to accurately measure and estimate the local light contributions of a large set of LEDs. This is enabled through tagging the light of each LED with an unique identifier. To this end, we propose a new family of modulation and multiple access schemes in this paper, named code-time division multiple access-pulse position modulation (CTDMA-PPM) and CTDMA-pulse width modulation (CTDMA-PWM). These schemes satisfy illumination constraints, are compatible with the commonly used PWM dimming of LEDs, and meet the multi-signal separation requirements for simultaneous measurement of illumination strengths. Based on these modulation methods, the paper develops algorithms to estimate illumination. Finally, performance analyses show that even for a very large number of LEDs, the sensing performance of the proposed system satisfies the requirements up to an adequate range.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/05071202.pdf","startPage":"3984","endPage":"3998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code Division-Based Sensing of Illumination Contributions in Solid-State Lighting Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071202/","displayDocTitle":"Code Division-Based Sensing of Illumination Contributions in Solid-State Lighting Systems","volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869459","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071202/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code Division-Based Sensing of Illumination Contributions in Solid-State Lighting Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-schenk-2025075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095277S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"5071202","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071205,"authors":[{"name":"Maxim Kuschnerov","affiliation":["University of Federal Armed Forces Munich, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5170198/5071205/5071205-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maxim Kuschnerov (S'05) was born in Kiev, Ukraine, in 1980.

As main degrading optical propagation effects, we considered chromatic dispersion (CD), polarization-mode dispersion (PMD), polarization-dependent loss (PDL), and cross-phase modulation (XPM). In the context of this work, we developed algorithms to increase the robustness of the single DSP receiver modules against the aforesaid propagation effects. In particular, we first present a new and fast algorithm to perform blind adaptive CD compensation through frequency-domain equalization. This low complexity equalizer component inherits a highly precise estimation of residual dispersion independent from previous or subsequent blocks. Next, we introduce an original dispersion-tolerant timing recovery and illustrate the derivation of blind polarization demultiplexing, capable to operate also in condition of high PDL. At last, we propose an XPM-mitigating carrier phase recovery as an extension of the standard Viterbi-Viterbi algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP for Coherent Single-Carrier Receivers","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2024963","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5170198/05071205.pdf","startPage":"3614","endPage":"3622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2024963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2009","displayDocTitle":"DSP for Coherent Single-Carrier Receivers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"16","htmlLink":"/document/5071205/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10792985","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSP for Coherent Single-Carrier Receivers","sourcePdf":"jlt-mkuschnerov-2024963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081845S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5170198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"5170198","articleId":"5071205","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071209,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaowei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Li","id":"37311146000"},{"name":"Hong Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA","College of Marine, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Liang","id":"37306127200"},{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-Gen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37274950700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5071209","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":684},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> The Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) allows to reconstruct a large integer from its remainders modulo several moduli.

In this paper, numerical simulation is carried out to investigate the feasibility of 1 Tb/s per channel CO-OFDM transmission. We find that, for 1 Tb/s CO-OFDM signal, the performance difference between single channel and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transmission is small. The maximum Q is 13.8 and 13.2 dB respectively for single channel and WDM transmission. We also investigate the CO-OFDM performance on the upgrade of 10-Gb/s to 100-Gb/s based DWDM systems with 50-GHz channel spacing to 100-Gb/s systems. It is shown that due to the high spectral efficiency and resilience to dispersion, for 100-Gb/s CO-OFDM signals, only 1.3 dB Q penalty is observed for 10 GHz laser frequency detuning. A comparison of CO-OFDM system performance under different data rate of 10.7 Gb/s, 42.8 Gb/s, 107 Gb/s and 1.07 Tb/s with and without the impact of dispersion compensation fiber is also presented. We find that the optimum fiber launch power increases almost linearly with the increase of data rate. 7 dB optimum launch power difference is observed between 107 Gb/s and 1.07 Tb/s CO-OFDM

multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. Often, CFO estimation is carried out using a preamble made of a number, say \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">J</i>\n , of repetitive slots (RS). We here focus on the issue of optimal RS preamble design using the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) averaged over the channel, which is assumed to be Rayleigh. We show that the optimal value of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">J</i>\n is a tradeoff between the multipath diversity gain and the number of unknowns to be estimated. In the case of correlated channel taps, we also show that uniform power loading of the active subcarriers is not optimal (in contrast with the uncorrelated case) and better power loading schemes are proposed. The proposed power loading schemes consist of allocating more power to activated carriers with higher signal-to-noise ratios. Simulation-based performance results of the maximum likelihood estimator support the CRB-based theoretical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training Design for Repetitive-Slot-Based CFO Estimation in OFDM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025080","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05071215.pdf","startPage":"4958","endPage":"4964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Training Design for Repetitive-Slot-Based CFO Estimation in OFDM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5071215/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977225","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training Design for Repetitive-Slot-Based CFO Estimation in OFDM","sourcePdf":"57tsp10-mghogho-2025080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079555S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5071215","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071220,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Fritscher","affiliation":["Department of Medical Image Analysis, Medical Informatics and Technology, University of the Health Sciences, Hall in Tirol, Austria"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Fritscher","id":"37318846000"},{"name":"Agnes Grunerbl","affiliation":["Department of Medical Image Analysis, Medical Informatics and Technology, University of the Health Sciences, Hall in Tirol, Austria"],"firstName":"Agnes","lastName":"Grunerbl","id":"37318845100"},{"name":"Markus Hanni","affiliation":["AO Development Institute, Davos Platz, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Hanni","id":"37318845600"},{"name":"Norbert Suhm","affiliation":["AO Development Institute, Davos Platz, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Suhm","id":"37318862800"},{"name":"Clemens Hengg","affiliation":["Department of Trauma Surgery, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Hengg","id":"37318863000"},{"name":"Rainer Schubert","affiliation":["Department of Medical Image Analysis, Medical Informatics and Technology, University of the Health Sciences, Hall in Tirol, Austria"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Schubert","id":"37312027800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"5071220","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":541},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"abstract":"Currently, conventional X-ray and CT images as well as invasive methods performed during the surgical intervention are used to judge the local quality of a fractured proximal femur. However, these approaches are either dependent on the surgeon's experience or cannot assist diagnostic and planning tasks preoperatively. Therefore, in this work a method for the individual analysis of local bone quality in the proximal femur based on model-based analysis of CT- and X-ray images of femur specimen will be proposed. A combined representation of shape and spatial intensity distribution of an object and different statistical approaches for dimensionality reduction are used to create a statistical appearance model in order to assess the local bone quality in CT and X-ray images. The developed algorithms are tested and evaluated on 28 femur specimen. It will be shown that the tools and algorithms presented herein are highly adequate to automatically and objectively predict bone mineral density values as well as a biomechanical parameter of the bone that can be measured intraoperatively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5263346/05071220.pdf","startPage":"1560","endPage":"1575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2009.2020734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2009.2020734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5263346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trabecular Bone Analysis in CT and X-Ray Images of the Proximal Femur for the Assessment of Local Bone Quality","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cancellous bone","Image analysis","Computed tomography","X-ray imaging","Surgery","Surges","Shape","Testing","Minerals","Density measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","bone","computerised tomography","diagnostic radiography","fracture","orthopaedics","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trabecular bone analysis","CT images","X-ray images","proximal femur","bone quality assessment","surgical intervention","shape representation","spatial intensity distribution","statistical appearance model","bone quality","bone mineral density","biomechanical parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Appearance models","bone quality","model based analysis","proximal femur","trabecular bone"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biomechanics","Bone and Bones","Bone and Bones","Female","Femoral Fractures","Femur","Femur","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Male","Models, Biological","Models, Statistical","Principal Component Analysis","Regression Analysis","Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Torque"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Trabecular Bone Analysis in CT and X-Ray Images of the Proximal Femur for the Assessment of Local Bone Quality","volume":"28","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5071220/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10881004","pubMedId":"19520636","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trabecular Bone Analysis in CT and X-Ray Images of the Proximal Femur for the Assessment of Local Bone Quality","sourcePdf":"tmi-kfritscher-2020734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114164S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5263346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5263346","articleId":"5071220","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071221,"authors":[{"name":"James E.

A process is presented that effectively shifts the computational burden of PCA from the resource-constrained encoder to a presumably more capable base-station decoder. The proposed approach, compressive-projection PCA (CPPCA), is driven by projections at the sensor onto lower-dimensional subspaces chosen at random, while the CPPCA decoder, given only these random projections, recovers not only the coefficients associated with the PCA transform, but also an approximation to the PCA transform basis itself. An analysis is presented that extends existing Rayleigh-Ritz theory to the special case of highly eccentric distributions; this analysis in turn motivates a reconstruction process at the CPPCA decoder that consists of a novel eigenvector reconstruction based on a convex-set optimization driven by Ritz vectors within the projected subspaces. As such, CPPCA constitutes a fundamental departure from traditional PCA in that it permits its excellent dimensionality-reduction and compression performance to be realized in an light-encoder/heavy-decoder system architecture. In experimental results, CPPCA outperforms a multiple-vector variant of compressed sensing for the reconstruction of hyperspectral data.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2025089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5234065/05071221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2025089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234065","startPage":"2230","endPage":"2242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive-Projection Principal Component Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive-Projection Principal Component Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10864224","pubMedId":"19520637","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5071221/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive-Projection Principal Component Analysis","sourcePdf":"tip-fowler-2025089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11985S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5234065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5234065","articleId":"5071221","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071226,"authors":[{"name":"Shiyi Shao","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/5071226/5071226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shiyi Shao received the B.Eng. and M.Phil. degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

Such systems normally consist of a large number of LEDs. In order to facilitate the control of such high-complexity system, a novel signal processing application, namely illumination sensing, is thus studied. In this paper, the system concept and research challenges of illumination sensing are presented. Thereafter, we investigate a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme to distinguish the signals from different LEDs, such that we are able to estimate the illuminances of all the LEDs simultaneously. Moreover, a filter bank sensor structure is proposed to study the key properties of the FDM scheme. Conditions on the design of the filter response are imposed for the ideal case without the existence of any frequency inaccuracy, as well as for the case with frequency inaccuracies. The maximum number of LEDs that can be supported for each case is also derived. In particular, it is shown that, among all the other considered functions, the use of the triangular function is able to give a better tradeoff between the number of LEDs that can be supported and the allowable clock inaccuracies within a practical range. Moreover, through numerical investigations, we show that many tens of LEDs can be supported for the considered system parameters.

The previous theoretical and simulation works have demonstrated that a 500-Hz single-phase high-frequency ac (HFAC) microgrid is a novel step toward integrating renewable energy sources in a distributed generation system. This paper goes one step further in describing the practical implementation of HFAC microgrid with active filters for a small 1-kW system. The protection issues for both the source and series converters are also addressed in this paper by developing a new but simple protection scheme. In the experimental microgrid system, a universal active power line conditioner (UPLC) and a unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) are incorporated to control the power flow and power quality, respectively. Controllers for both the UPQC and UPLC are developed based on the instantaneous single-phase p-q theory, and controlled pulsewidth modulated inverters are then implemented to synthesize the desired compensating waveforms. The experimental results obtained confirm that the HFAC microgrid is a practical and useful step toward successfully integrating distributed renewable energy sources ensuring the improved system utilization.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2009.2015998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5224009/05071240.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2009.2015998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Evaluation of Active Filtering in a Single-Phase High-Frequency AC Microgrid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071240/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Evaluation of Active Filtering in a Single-Phase High-Frequency AC Microgrid","volume":"24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10841786","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071240/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Evaluation of Active Filtering in a Single-Phase High-Frequency AC Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tec-chakraborty-2015998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051534S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5224009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5224009","articleId":"5071240","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071241,"authors":[{"name":"Sercan Teleke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5224009/5071241/5071241-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sercan Teleke (S'08) was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1983.

This paper focuses on development of a control strategy for optimal use of the BESS for this purpose. The paper considers a conventional feedback-based control scheme with revisions to incorporate the operating constraints of the BESS, such as state of charge limits, charge/discharge rate, and lifetime. The goal of the control is to have the BESS provide as much smoothing as possible so that the wind farm can be dispatched on an hourly basis based on the forecasted wind conditions. The effectiveness of this control strategy has been tested by using an actual wind farm data. Finally, it is shown that the control strategy is very important in determining the proper BESS size needed for this application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071241/","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5071241/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10846918","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Control Strategies for Battery Energy Storage for Wind Farm Dispatching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Strategies for Battery Energy Storage for Wind Farm Dispatching","sourcePdf":"tec-baran-2016000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102005S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5224009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"359","xplore-issue":"5224009","articleId":"5071241","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5071242,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Mohammad Dehghan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5224009/5071242/5071242-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seyed Mohammad Dehghan (S\u201908) was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1981.

Reverberant speech can be separated into two components, viz. early speech and late reverberant speech. Recently, various algorithms have been developed to suppress late reverberant speech. One of the main challenges is to develop an estimator for the so-called late reverberant spectral variance (LRSV) which is required by most of these algorithms. In this letter a statistical reverberation model is proposed that takes the energy contribution of the direct-path into account. This model is then used to derive a more general LRSV estimator, which in a particular case reduces to an existing LRSV estimator. Experimental results show that the developed estimator is advantageous in case the source-microphone distance is smaller than the critical distance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing

the ultralow current-mode amplifier (ULCA), which serves for the preamplification of biosensor signals, has been in high demand in areas like ultralow biocurrent analysis and detection,

The experimental results show that the proposed ULCA can completely satisfy the specifications of IBS and stably provide the current gain of 19.9 dB, 3-dB bandwidth of 15 kHz, and input range of -0.4 to 0.4 mA, with only 1.5 nA of dc quiescent current.

It can be both folded and stretched significantly without permanent damage or loss of electrical functionality. The antenna is manufactured with a process in which conductors are realized by injecting room temperature liquid metal alloy into micro-structured channels in an elastic dielectric material. The elastic dielectric material together with the liquid metal enables bending with a very small radius, twisting, and stretching along any direction. Port impedance and radiation characteristics of the non-stretched and stretched antenna are studied in simulations and experiments. The presented antenna has a return loss better than 10 dB within 3-11 GHz and a radiation efficiency of > 70% over 3-10 GHz, also when stretched. Tests verify that stretching up to 40% is possible with maintained electrical performance. The presented antenna is useful for example for body-worn antennas and in applications in harsh environments where mechanical flexibility helps improve durability.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5338646/05071262.pdf","startPage":"3765","endPage":"3771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2024560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2024560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Foldable and Stretchable Liquid Metal Planar Inverted Cone Antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conducting materials","Dielectric materials","Ultra wideband antennas","Inorganic materials","Frequency","Integrated circuit interconnections","Sheet materials","Ultra wideband technology","Silicon","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric materials","liquid metals","microwave antennas","planar inverted-F antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar inverted cone antenna","ultrawideband antennas","liquid metal alloy","elastic dielectric material","temperature 293 K to 298 K","frequency 3 GHz to 11 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Liquid alloy","planar inverted cone antenna (PICA)","polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)","stretchable electronics","ultrawideband (UWB)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Foldable and Stretchable Liquid Metal Planar Inverted Cone Antenna","volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5071262/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10998775","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Foldable and Stretchable Liquid Metal Planar Inverted Cone Antenna","sourcePdf":"tap-zwu-2024560.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054591S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5338646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5338646","articleId":"5071262","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071263,"authors":[{"name":"Byonghyo Shim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byonghyo","lastName":"Shim","id":"37277951300"},{"name":"Insung Kang","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Insung","lastName":"Kang","id":"37308861500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5071263","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":312},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a simple yet effective modulation classification method for maximum likelihood multiuser detection.

The surface impedance function of a lossy medium is approximated by a series of rational functions in the Laplace domain, whereas the dyadic differential operator is approximated by a second-order power series. By assuming that the fields are piecewise linear, the time-domain convolution integrals are computed using a recursive formula. The impedance function of a coating layer is approximated by a third-order power series. The algorithm can be applied to scattering problems of a three-dimensional coating for both vertically and horizontally polarized waves. The advantage of the proposed method is that the result can be applied to media of arbitrary conductivities, with a wide range of incident angles from zero to graze. Some numerical examples are given to substantiate the theory.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2024482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5191308/05071265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2024482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191308","startPage":"2397","endPage":"2408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD Implementation and Application of High Order Impedance Boundary Condition Using Rational Functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FDTD Implementation and Application of High Order Impedance Boundary Condition Using Rational Functions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071265/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10805963","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5071265/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD Implementation and Application of High Order Impedance Boundary Condition Using Rational Functions","sourcePdf":"57tap08-kleung-2024482.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075897S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5191308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5191308","articleId":"5071265","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071266,"authors":[{"name":"Weiming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Research, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Weiming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291408100"},{"name":"Xuexiu Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Information Research, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xuexiu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37309694300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5071266","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Embedding Efficiency of Wet Paper Codes by Paper Folding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steganography","Pixel","Computational complexity","Payloads","Error correction codes","Linear code","Digital images","Resists","Research and development","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","computational complexity","steganography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["paper folding","steganographic scheme","wet paper coding method","low computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedding efficiency","LT process","relative payload","steganogaphy","wet paper codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071266","abstract":"Wet paper codes are used to design steganographic schemes, in which the sender can embed messages into a cover with arbitrarily selected changeable bits that are not shared by the recipient.

For the OFDM two-hop relay system with separate power constraints, joint subcarrier matching and power allocation is considered in this paper, which uses the ldquodecode-and-forwardrdquo relay strategy. The aforementioned problem can be formulated as a mixed binary integer programming problem, which is prohibitive when trying to find the global optimum. By separating the subcarrier matching and the power allocation, the optimal scheme, i.e., the optimal joint subcarrier matching and power allocation, is presented in this paper. After that, a suboptimal scheme with less complexity is also proposed, which can also be used to better understand the effects of power allocation. Simulation results show that the capacity of the optimal scheme is almost equivalent to the upper bound of the system capacity, and the capacity of the suboptimal scheme is close to that of the optimal scheme. In addition, simulation results also show that the one-to-one subcarrier matching is almost optimal, although it simplifies the system architecture.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2024674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05071270.pdf","startPage":"4943","endPage":"4954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2024674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Maximization for OFDM Two-Hop Relay System With Separate Power Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071270/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Maximization for OFDM Two-Hop Relay System With Separate Power Constraints","volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966651","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071270/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Maximization for OFDM Two-Hop Relay System With Separate Power Constraints","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2024674.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077803S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5071270","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071271,"authors":[{"name":"Giampaolo Ferraioli","affiliation":["Dipartimento per le Tecnologie, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Parthenopes, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Giampaolo","lastName":"Ferraioli","id":"37313871100"},{"name":"Aymen Shabou","affiliation":["Institut Telecom, Telecom ParisTechnology, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Aymen","lastName":"Shabou","id":"37314192700"},{"name":"Florence Tupin","affiliation":["Institut Telecom, Telecom ParisTechnology, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Florence","lastName":"Tupin","id":"37267795900"},{"name":"Vito Pascazio","affiliation":["Dipartimento per le Tecnologie, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Parthenopes, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Vito","lastName":"Pascazio","id":"37267229100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5071271","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071271","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar interferometry","Markov random fields","Telecommunications","Phase noise","Robustness","Filtering algorithms","Synthetic aperture radar","Phase estimation","Phase measurement","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","Markov processes","optimisation","radar interferometry","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel phase unwrapping","Markovian approach","graph-cut-based optimization algorithms","interferometric synthetic aperture radar systems","InSAR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graph cuts","Markov random field","multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2009.2021165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5153590/05071271.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2009.2021165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel Phase Unwrapping With Graph Cuts","abstract":"Markovian approaches have proven to be effective for solving the multichannel phase-unwrapping (PU) problem, particularly when dealing with noisy data and big discontinuities.

Interactive methods in MOP are techniques that can help the decision maker (DM) to generate the most preferred solution from a set of efficient solutions. An interactive method should be capable of capturing the preferences of the DM in a pragmatic and comprehensive way. In certain decision situations, it may be easier and more reliable for DMs to follow an interactive process for providing local tradeoffs than other kinds of preferential information like aspiration levels, objective function classification, etc. The proposed PROJECT method belongs to the class of interactive local tradeoff methods. It is based on the projection of utility function gradients onto the tangent hyperplane of an efficient set and on a new local search procedure that inherits the advantages of the reference-point method to search for the best compromise solution within a local region. Most of the interactive methods based on local tradeoffs assume convexity conditions in a MOP problem, which is too restrictive in many real-life applications. The use of a reference-point procedure makes it possible to generate any efficient solutions, even the nonsupported solutions or efficient solutions located in the nonconvex part of the efficient frontier of a nonconvex MOP problem. The convergence of the proposed method is investigated. A nonlinear example is examined using the new method, as well as a case study on efficiency analysis with value judgements. The proposed PROJECT method is coded in Microsoft Visual C++ and incorporated into the software PROMOIN (Interactive MOP).","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2019855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2019855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5076135/05071283.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"PROJECT Method for Multiobjective Optimization Based on Gradient Projection and Reference Points","volume":"39","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10705022","htmlLink":"/document/5071283/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PROJECT Method for Multiobjective Optimization Based on Gradient Projection and Reference Points","sourcePdf":"tsmca-luque-2019855.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122499S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5076135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5076135","articleId":"5071283","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071287,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Khaligh","affiliation":["Energy Harvesting and Renewable Energies Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5410131/5071287/5071287-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Khaligh (S'04\u2013M'06\u2013SM'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering (with highest distinction) from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago.","He is an Assistant Professor and the Director of the Energy Harvesting and Renewable Energies Laboratory (EHREL), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IIT, where he has established courses and curriculum in the area of energy harvesting and renewable energy sources.

As a result, the traditional iris recognition systems would not work well. However, these kinds of iris recognition systems have been widely deployed in law enforcement and homeland security. It will be desirable to transform the traditional systems to perform in nonideal situations without a costly update. In this paper, we propose a method that upgrades the traditional iris recognition system to work on nonideal situations. The proposed method takes into consideration not only the effect of image quality but also the segmentation accuracy. It employs video-based image-processing techniques to quickly identify and eliminate the bad quality images from iris videos for further processing. The proposed method is tested on public databases using in-house recognition algorithms and also evaluated using a commercialized system.

However, in reality the channels connecting the multiple nodes of a cooperative system typically become time-selective due to the relative mobility of the cooperating terminals. Hence, the performance gain achieved may erode as the environment becomes more time-selective. Hence in this paper, we specifically design the multiple-symbol based differential sphere detection (MSDSD) for the DAF-aided cooperative system, which is capable of achieving a significant performance gain for transmission over time-selective channels.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2024871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5170191/05071289.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2024871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170191","startPage":"913","endPage":"916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Uplink Using Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere-Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Uplink Using Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere-Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071289/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10826374","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Uplink Using Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere-Detection","sourcePdf":"16lsp09-lhanzo-2024871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039321S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","isNumber":"5170191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5071289","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071291,"authors":[{"name":"Shihua Li","affiliation":["School of Automation, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/5071291/5071291-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shihua Li (M'05) was born in Pingxiang, China, in 1975.

First, a composite control method, i.e., the extended-state-observer (ESO)-based control method, is employed to ensure the performance of the closed-loop system. The ESO can estimate both the states and the disturbances simultaneously so that the composite speed controller can have a corresponding part to compensate for the disturbances. Then, considering the case of variations of load inertia, an adaptive control scheme is developed by analyzing the control performance relationship between the feedforward compensation gain and the system inertia. By using inertia identification techniques, a fuzzy-inferencer-based supervisor is designed to automatically tune the feedforward compensation gain according to the identified inertia.

A control structure consists of a feedforward ANN that approximates the manipulator's inverse dynamical model, an ANN feedback control law, a reference model, and the adaptation process of the ANNs with a variable learning rate. A supervisor that adapts the neural network's learning rate and a rule-based supervisor for online adaptation of the parameters of the reference model are proposed to maintain the stability of the system for large variations of load parameters. Simulation results highlight the performance of the controller to compensate the nonlinear friction terms, particularly Coulomb friction, and flexibility, and its robustness to the load and drive motor inertia parameter changes. Internal stability, which is a potential problem in such a system, is also verified. The controller is suitable for DSP and very large scale integration implementation and can be used to improve static and dynamic performances of electromechanical systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10793155","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5071295/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ANN-Based Adaptive Control of Robotic Manipulators With Friction and Joint Elasticity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANN-Based Adaptive Control of Robotic Manipulators With Friction and Joint Elasticity","sourcePdf":"tie-gueaieb-2024657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099967S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"5071295","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":5071298,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Hee Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Mechatronics Engineering, Kyungsung University, Busan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/5071298/5071298-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong-Hee Lee was born on November 11, 1970.

This novel scheme using nonlinear TSF manipulates currents in two adjacent phases during commutation, so that efficiency and torque ripple in an SRM drive can be considerably improved. For constant torque generation, the switching of one-phase windings is regulated, and torque reference for the other phase stays at the previous state under the condition of a certain current limit given by the overall drive power rating. Every torque state monitored by the nonlinear logical condition determines a regulated or nonregulated torque control among two phases overlapped in commutation region, where one phase is incoming to produce the majority of torque and the outgoing current in the other phase is decreasingly controlled by the logical condition. Due to the same switching state in a nonregulated phase and the reduction of commutation period by the proposed control method, the switching number can be significantly reduced, and hence, the switching loss can be reduced. In case that one-phase regulation cannot satisfy a proper torque reference required for minimum torque ripple operation, a two-phase regulation mode is employed in the novel nonlinear TSF. In order to include magnetic nonlinearity in torque control and decrease a current tail at the end of commutation, the current of the incoming phase needs to be controlled in an increasing manner, and at the same time, the outgoing phase current tracks on an opposite direction so that torque sharing between two phases can be smoothly achieved with a minimum current crossover. The proposed control scheme is verified by some computer simulations and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2024661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/05071298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2024661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","startPage":"3021","endPage":"3028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Nonlinear Logical Torque Sharing Function for Low-Torque Ripple SR Drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Nonlinear Logical Torque Sharing Function for Low-Torque Ripple SR Drive","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793156","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5071298/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Nonlinear Logical Torque Sharing Function for Low-Torque Ripple SR Drive","sourcePdf":"tie-ahn-2024661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050443S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"5071298","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5071299,"authors":[{"name":"Jaume Miret","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Vilanova i la Geltru, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/5071299/5071299-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaume Miret (M'01) received the B.S. degree in telecommunications and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics from the Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, in 1992, 1999, and 2005, respectively.","Since 1993, he has been an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain, where he teaches courses on digital design and circuit theory.

We compare electrical and optical interconnects and project the requirements for optoelectronic and optical devices if optics is to solve the major problems of interconnects for future high-performance silicon chips. Optics has potential benefits in interconnect density, energy, and timing. The necessity of low interconnect energy imposes low limits especially on the energy of the optical output devices, with a ~ 10 fJ/bit device energy target emerging. Some optical modulators and radical laser approaches may meet this requirement. Low (e.g., a few femtofarads or less) photodetector capacitance is important. Very compact wavelength splitters are essential for connecting the information to fibers. Dense waveguides are necessary on-chip or on boards for guided wave optical approaches, especially if very high clock rates or dense wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is to be avoided. Free-space optics potentially can handle the necessary bandwidths even without fast clocks or WDM.

By making full use of the information concerning the probability distribution of the delays, criteria for the stochastic stability and stabilization controller design are derived. Traditionally, in the case that the variation range of the time delay is available, the maximum allowable bound of time delays can be calculated to ensure the stability of the time-delay system. It is shown, via numerical examples, that such a maximum allowable bound could be made larger in the case that the probability distribution of the time delay is known.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilization of Systems With Probabilistic Interval Input Delays and Its Applications to Networked Control Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2019875","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5076135/05071310.pdf","startPage":"939","endPage":"945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2019875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071310/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Stabilization of Systems With Probabilistic Interval Input Delays and Its Applications to Networked Control Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705023","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilization of Systems With Probabilistic Interval Input Delays and Its Applications to Networked Control Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmca-wang-2019875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07515S","chronDate":"July  2009","isNumber":"5076135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"164","articleId":"5071310","onlineDate":"10 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5071378,"authors":[{"name":"Pao-Ann Hsiung","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pao-Ann","lastName":"Hsiung","id":"37277259000"},{"name":"Shang-Wei Lin","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shang-Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37088629112"},{"name":"Yean-Ru Chen","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yean-Ru Chen","id":"37088629121"},{"name":"Nien-Lin Hsueh","affiliation":["Feng Chia University FCU, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Nien-Lin Hsueh","id":"37087565308"},{"name":"Chih-Hung Chang","affiliation":["Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Hung Chang","id":"37087337767"},{"name":"Chih-Hsiong Shih","affiliation":["Tunghai University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Hsiong Shih","id":"37088629010"},{"name":"Chorng-Shiuh Koong","affiliation":["National Taichung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chorng-Shiuh Koong","id":"37087276163"},{"name":"Chao-Sheng Lin","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chao-Sheng Lin","id":"37088629138"},{"name":"Chun-Hsien Lu","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Hsien Lu","id":"37088628965"},{"name":"Sheng-Ya Tong","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sheng-Ya Tong","id":"37088629158"},{"name":"Wan-Ting Su","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wan-Ting Su","id":"37088629069"},{"name":"William C.

We propose a new VERTAF/Multi-Core (VMC) framework to bridge this gap. In this work, we mainly show how VMC generates code automatically from user-specified SysML models for multi-core embedded systems. We illustrate how model-driven design based on SysML can be seamlessly integrated with Intels threading building blocks (TBB) and the Quantum Framework middleware. We use a digital video recording system to illustrate the benefits of VMC.

For hardware platforms for neural networks that implement some degree of realism of interest to neuroscientists, connectivity between neurons can be a major limitation. Recent data indicates that neurons in the brain form clusters of connections. Through the combination of this data and a routing scheme that uses a hybrid of short-range direct connectivity and an AER (address event representation) network, the presented architecture aims to provide a useful amount of inter-neuron connectivity. A connection-centric design can provide opportunities for NoCs such as optimising power, bandwidth or introducing redundancy. A method of mapping a network to the architecture is discussed, along with results of optimal hardware specifications for a given set of network parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connection-centric network for spiking neural networks","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip","doi":"10.1109/NOCS.2009.5071462","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066987/5071428/05071462.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOCS.2009.5071462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Connection-centric network for spiking neural networks","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071462/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703141","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connection-centric network for spiking neural networks","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"06_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055294S","chronDate":"10-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066987","isNumber":"5071428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066987","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5071428","articleId":"5071462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5071474,"authors":[{"name":"Young Hoon Kang","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Young Hoon","lastName":"Kang","id":"37308607800"},{"name":"Taek-Jun Kwon","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Taek-Jun","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37272486300"},{"name":"Jeff Draper","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Draper","id":"37266688700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4142-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4143-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5071474","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071474","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual colonoscopy","Delay","Throughput","Switches","Network-on-a-chip","Resource management","Telecommunication traffic","Pipelines","Routing","Area measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","network-on-chip","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic packet fragmentation","virtual channel utilization","on-chip routers","congestion propagation effect"]}],"abstract":"Conventional packet-switched on-chip routers provide good resource sharing while minimizing latencies through various techniques. A virtual channel (VC) is allocated on a per-packet basis and held until the entire packet exits the VC buffer. This sometimes leads to inefficient use of VCs at high network loads. A blocked packet can affect adjacent routers, resulting in a congestion propagation effect. In such a scenario, VC buffers may be empty although they are regarded as fully occupied by a blocked packet. This paper proposes a dynamic packet fragmentation technique which releases empty VC buffers by fragmenting packets and allowing other packets to use the freed VC buffers. Thus, fragmentation increases VC utilization. Simulation experiments show performance improvement in terms of latency and throughput up to 20% and 7.5%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/NOCS.2009.5071474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOCS.2009.5071474","startPage":"250","endPage":"255","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066987/5071428/05071474.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic packet fragmentation for increased virtual channel utilization in on-chip routers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071474/","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic packet fragmentation for increased virtual channel utilization in on-chip routers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10703153","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5071474/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic packet fragmentation for increased virtual channel utilization in on-chip routers","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"08_5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05339S","chronDate":"10-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066987","isNumber":"5071428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066987","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5071428","articleId":"5071474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5071477,"authors":[{"name":"Prabhat Kumar","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Prabhat","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37308180300"},{"name":"Yan Pan","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Pan","id":"37307880000"},{"name":"John Kim","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA","Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Kim","id":"37311384600"},{"name":"Gokhan Memik","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Gokhan","lastName":"Memik","id":"38367265800"},{"name":"Alok Choudhary","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Alok","lastName":"Choudhary","id":"37285106100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4142-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4143-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5071477","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Network topology","Costs","Degradation","Resource management","Bandwidth","Very large scale integration","Communication system control","Wiring","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["costing","network routing","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exploring concentration","channel slicing","on-chip network router","cost efficient","network on-chip","virtual concentration"]}],"abstract":"Sharing on-chip network resources efficiently is critical in the design of a cost-efficient network on-chip (NoC). Concentration has been proposed for on-chip networks but the trade-off in concentration implementation and performance has not been well understood. In this paper, we describe cost-efficient implementations of concentration and show how external concentration provides a significant reduction in complexity (47% and 36% reduction in area and energy, respectively) compared to previous assumed integrated (high-radix) concentration while degrading overall performance by only 10%. Hybrid implementations of concentration is also presented which provide additional tradeoff between complexity and performance. To further reduce the cost of NoC, we describe how channel slicing can be used together with concentration. We propose virtual concentration which further reduces the complexity - saving area and energy by 69% and 32% compared to baseline mesh and 88% and 35% over baseline concentrated mesh.","doi":"10.1109/NOCS.2009.5071477","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066987/5071428/05071477.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOCS.2009.5071477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring concentration and channel slicing in on-chip network router","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071477/","displayDocTitle":"Exploring concentration and channel slicing in on-chip network router","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703156","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071477/","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring concentration and channel slicing in on-chip network router","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"09_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127923S","chronDate":"10-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066987","isNumber":"5071428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066987","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5071428","articleId":"5071477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5071526,"authors":[{"name":"Hien Nguyen Van","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Hien","lastName":"Nguyen Van","id":"38254932400"},{"name":"Frederic Dang Tran","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Dang Tran","id":"37312358900"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Menaud","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement Informatique, \u00c9cole des Mines de Nantes-INRIA, LINA, CNRS, Nantes, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Menaud","id":"37321107500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3713-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5071526","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":98,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":754},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Virtual machining","Cloud computing","Computer applications","Platform virtualization","Environmental management","Automatic control","Resource virtualization","Cost function","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","computer centres","constraint handling","network servers","power aware computing","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomic virtual resource management","service hosting platform","server virtualization","virtual machines","cloud providers","virtual servers","QoS requirements","SLA","constraint programming"]}],"abstract":"Cloud platforms host several independent applications on a shared resource pool with the ability to allocate computing power to applications on a per-demand basis. The use of server virtualization techniques for such platforms provide great flexibility with the ability to consolidate several virtual machines on the same physical server, to resize a virtual machine capacity and to migrate virtual machine across physical servers. A key challenge for cloud providers is to automate the management of virtual servers while taking into account both high-level QoS requirements of hosted applications and resource management costs. This paper proposes an autonomic resource manager to control the virtualized environment which decouples the provisioning of resources from the dynamic placement of virtual machines. This manager aims to optimize a global utility function which integrates both the degree of SLA fulfillment and the operating costs. We resort to a constraint programming approach to formulate and solve the optimization problem. Results obtained through simulations validate our approach.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2009.5071526","publicationTitle":"2009 ICSE Workshop on Software Engineering Challenges of Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ICSE Workshop on Software Engineering Challenges of Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061476/5071513/05071526.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2009.5071526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071513","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomic virtual resource management for service hosting platforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Autonomic virtual resource management for service hosting platforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071526/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-23 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10718487","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5071526/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomic virtual resource management for service hosting platforms","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079279S","chronDate":"23-23 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061476","isNumber":"5071513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061476","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5071513","articleId":"5071526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5071527,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Stage","affiliation":["Internet-based Information Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Stage","id":"37303759500"},{"name":"Thomas Setzer","affiliation":["Internet-based Information Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Setzer","id":"37303758800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3713-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5071527","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":537},"abstract":"Server virtualization enables dynamic workload management for data centers. However, especially live migrations of virtual machines (VM) induce significant overheads on physical hosts and the shared network infrastructure possibly leading to host overloads and SLA violations of co-hosted applications. While some recent work addresses the impact of live migrations on CPUs of physical hosts, little attention has been given to the control and optimization of migration algorithms and migration-related network bandwidth consumption. In this paper we introduce network topology aware scheduling models for VM live migrations. We propose a scheme for classifying VMs based on their workload characteristics and propose adequate resource and migration scheduling models for each class, taking network bandwidth requirements of migrations and network topologies into account. We also underline the necessity for additional migration control parameters for efficient migration scheduling.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ICSE Workshop on Software Engineering Challenges of Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061476/5071513/05071527.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"2009 ICSE Workshop on Software Engineering Challenges of Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2009.5071527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2009.5071527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-aware migration control and scheduling of differentiated virtual machine workloads","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual machining","Virtual manufacturing","Bandwidth","Switches","Network topology","Network servers","Voice mail","Platform virtualization","Load management","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-aware migration control","differentiated virtual machine workloads","dynamic workload management","data centers","host overloads","SLA violations","network bandwidth consumption","network topology aware scheduling","migration scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Network-aware migration control and scheduling of differentiated virtual machine workloads","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071527/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10718488","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-23 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-aware migration control and scheduling of differentiated virtual machine workloads","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055707S","chronDate":"23-23 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5061476","isNumber":"5071513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061476","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"5071513","articleId":"5071527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5071528,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Li","id":"37072961700"},{"name":"John Chinneck","affiliation":["Dept. of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Chinneck","id":"37303968700"},{"name":"Murray Woodside","affiliation":["Dept. of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Murray","lastName":"Woodside","id":"37272014400"},{"name":"Marin Litoiu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, York University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Marin","lastName":"Litoiu","id":"37268046300"},{"name":"Gabriel Iszlai","affiliation":["IBM, Toronto","IBM, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Iszlai","id":"37303969100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3713-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5071528","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":590},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071528","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","quality of service","software architecture","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS guarantees","clouds","performance models","runtime optimization","optimization algorithm","SLA"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a method for achieving optimization in clouds by using performance models in the development, deployment and operations of the applications running in the cloud.

Then, the FLD is chosen to maximize the ratio of between-class distance to within-class distance from the statistical scope.

In particular, the considered THz sensor is obtained by means of an open SIW waveguide which transmits and receives the electromagnetic waves used for the inspection of the target under test. Substrate integrated waveguides allow THz waves propagation by using quite standard Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology and so they may be good candidates for obtaining guiding structures in the THz band with moderate costs and the possibility of integration with other devices. The adopted FDTD simulator is able to take into account of both the propagation inside the SIW and the interactions of THz waves with dielectric structures.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Imaging Systems and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/5039319/5071585/05071645.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"262","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Imaging Systems and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/IST.2009.5071645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IST.2009.5071645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD modeling of a SIW based sensor for THz diagnostics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic waveguides","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Waveguide components","Electromagnetic scattering","Inspection","Circuit testing","Electromagnetic propagation","Printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave transmission","finite difference time-domain analysis","printed circuits","substrate integrated waveguides","terahertz wave detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD simulator model","SIW based sensor diagnostics","standard printed circuit board technology","electromagnetic wave transmission","SIW dielectric structure","terahertz wave band sensor","substrate integrated waveguide"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"FDTD modeling of a SIW based sensor for THz diagnostics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071645/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10702714","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD modeling of a SIW based sensor for THz diagnostics","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"1569189100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082411S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5039319","isNumber":"5071585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5039319","xplore-issue":"5071585","articleId":"5071645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5071662,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Rao","affiliation":["Department of electrical and electronics engineering, Nanchang Institute of Technology, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Wei Rao","id":"37299765400"},{"name":"Jing-jing Lian","affiliation":["Department of electrical and electronics engineering, Nanchang Institute of Technology, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Jing-jing Lian","id":"37318986500"},{"name":"Fei Xia","affiliation":["Department of electrical and electronics engineering, Nanchang Institute of Technology, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Fei Xia","id":"37309086500"},{"name":"Li Fan","affiliation":["Department of electrical and electronics engineering, Nanchang Institute of Technology, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Li Fan","id":"37308021500"},{"name":"Hui-jun Xu","affiliation":["Department of electrical and electronics engineering, Nanchang Institute of Technology, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Hui-jun Xu","id":"37309102700"},{"name":"Wen-qun Tan","affiliation":["Department of electrical and electronics engineering, Nanchang Institute of Technology, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Wen-qun Tan","id":"37306182700"},{"name":"Guo-xing Dai","affiliation":["Department of electrical and electronics engineering, Nanchang Institute of Technology, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Guo-xing Dai","id":"37307168200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3482-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3483-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-2809"}],"articleNumber":"5071662","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Quadrature phase shift keying","Intersymbol interference","Detection algorithms","Cost function","Signal detection","Higher order statistics","Adaptive equalizers","Counting circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint blind equalization","signal detection algorithm","QAM signal","quadrature amplitude modulation","cost function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind equalization","order detection","cost function"]}],"abstract":"A blind equalization and order detection algorithm suitable for QAM signal is proposed.

Typically, these converters have several paralleled power stages, with a current loop in each phase and a single voltage loop. The presence of the current loops avoids current imbalance among phases. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in CCM, with a proper design, there is an intrinsic mechanism of self-balance that reduces the current imbalance. Thus, in the buck converter, if natural zero-voltage switching (ZVS) is achieved in both transitions, the instantaneous inductor current compensates partially the different DC currents through the phases. The need for using \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n current loops will be finally determined by the application but not by the converter itself. Using the buck converter as a base, a multiphase converter has been developed. Several tests have been carried out in the laboratory and the results show clearly that, when the conditions are met, the phase currents are very well balanced even during transient conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buck converters","Power supplies","Vehicle dynamics","Zero voltage switching","Bandwidth","Topology","Digital control","Filters","Packaging","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic response","switching convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-balance mechanism","multiphase buck converter","power supplies","dynamic response","zero-voltage switching","inductor current compensation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC\u2013DC power conversion"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2013859","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4939357/05071728.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2013859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current Self-Balance Mechanism in Multiphase Buck Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Current Self-Balance Mechanism in Multiphase Buck Converter","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10756699","publicationDate":"June 2009","volume":"24","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071728/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Self-Balance Mechanism in Multiphase Buck Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-garcia-2013859.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07331S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4939357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4939357","articleId":"5071728","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5071730,"authors":[{"name":"Laxman Maharjan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Laxman","lastName":"Maharjan","id":"37303836600"},{"name":"Shigenori Inoue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan","Hitachi and Limited, Hitachi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigenori","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37289627500"},{"name":"Hirofumi Akagi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Akagi","id":"37271018200"},{"name":"Jun Asakura","affiliation":["Panasonic Corporation, Moriguchi, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Asakura","id":"37303835200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"5071730","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":385,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":9569},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071730","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Batteries","Energy storage","Pulse width modulation converters","Renewable energy resources","Wind turbines","Power generation","Wind energy generation","Photovoltaic cells","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage","nickel","PWM power convertors","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state-of-charge balancing control","battery energy storage system","cascade PWM converter","renewable energy source","nickel metal hydride battery unit","voltage 6.6 kV","voltage 200 V","power 10 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active-power control","battery energy storage system (BESS)","cascade converter","nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery","state-of-charge (SOC) balancing"]}],"abstract":"Renewable energy sources such as wind turbine generators and photovoltaics produce fluctuating electric power.

The presented optimized direct power control (ODPC) provides a closed-form formula for the converter space-vector voltage, which, based on Lagrange operators for the optimum trajectory, provides the commanded complex apparent power. The voltage required by the ODPC is obtained with a standard modulation that synthesizes the mean value required during the control cycle. The converter's performance using the ODPC algorithm improves over existing DPC-based algorithms that use constrained optimization, such as preselected space vectors or switching tables, by providing a further harmonic in content reduction, lower computational requirements, and faster time response to changes in active and reactive power commands. The use of the ODPC results in an almost instantaneous active and reactive power reference tracking, allowing for full power inversion in less than 1.0 ms under constant switching operation. Simulation results and experimental verifications are presented to validate the advantages of the proposed control algorithm. The scope of applications of this technique is those that require low harmonic impact on the ac power supply and for power quality improvement in general.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4939357/05071731.pdf","startPage":"1637","endPage":"1645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2014953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2014953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939357","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Space Vector Computation Technique for Direct Power Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Voltage control","Power system harmonics","Reactive power","Lagrangian functions","Switching converters","Constraint optimization","Time factors","Computational modeling","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","optimisation","power conversion harmonics","reactive power control","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum space vector computation technique","direct power control","converter space-vector voltage","Lagrange operator","switching frequency","optimization technique","active power tracking","reactive power tracking","low-harmonic impact"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active filters","power control","power quality","predictive control","reactive power control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Space Vector Computation Technique for Direct Power Control","volume":"24","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5071731/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10756702","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Space Vector Computation Technique for Direct Power Control","sourcePdf":"tpel-restrepo-2014953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076126S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4939357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4939357","articleId":"5071731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5071733,"authors":[{"name":"Robert C.

The proposed design features low device voltage stress, high efficiency over a wide load range, and excellent transient performance. Two experimental prototypes have been built and evaluated. One is a 110-MHz, 23-W converter that uses a high-performance RF lateral DMOSFET. The converter achieves higher than 87% efficiency at nominal input and output voltages, and maintains good efficiency down to 5% of full load. The second implementation, aimed toward integration, is a 50-MHz, 17-W converter that uses a transistor from a 50-V integrated power process. In addition, two resonant gate drive schemes suitable for VHF operation are presented, both of which provide rapid startup and low-loss operation. Both converters regulate the output using high-bandwidth, on-off hysteretic control, which enables fast transient response and efficient light-load operation. The low energy storage requirements of the converters allow the use of aircore inductors in both designs, thereby eliminating magnetic core loss and introducing the possibility of easy integration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10756704","htmlLink":"/document/5071733/","displayDocTitle":"Very-High-Frequency Resonant Boost Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very-High-Frequency Resonant Boost Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-sagneri-2016098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087443S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4939357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"4939357","articleId":"5071733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5071734,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Busquets-Monge","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Busquets-Monge","id":"37265964100"},{"name":"Salvador Alepuz","affiliation":["Matar\u00f3 School of Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Matar\u00f3, Spain"],"firstName":"Salvador","lastName":"Alepuz","id":"37275467500"},{"name":"Josep Bordonau","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Bordonau","id":"37275460700"},{"name":"Juan Peracaula","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Peracaula","id":"37294911600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"5071734","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diodes","Equations","Electrons"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071734","abstract":"In the above titled paper (ibid., vol. 23, no. 4, pp. 1751-1758, Jul 08), some equations were printed incorrectly.

In such a model, users access services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted.

The latter term denotes the infrastructure as a ldquoCloudrdquo in which businesses and users are able to access applications from anywhere in the world on demand. Hence, Cloud computing can be classed as a new paradigm for the dynamic creation of next-generation Data Centers by assembling services of networked Virtual Machines (VMs). Thus, the computing world is rapidly transforming towards developing software for millions to consume as a service rather than creating software for millions to run on their PCs.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2009.97","publicationTitle":"2009 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5071832/5071833/05071845.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2009.97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071833","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Market-Oriented Cloud Computing: Vision, Hype, and Reality of Delivering Computing as the 5th Utility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Market-Oriented Cloud Computing: Vision, Hype, and Reality of Delivering Computing as the 5th Utility","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071845/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703263","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5071845/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Market-Oriented Cloud Computing: Vision, Hype, and Reality of Delivering Computing as the 5th Utility","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3622a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044638S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5071832","isNumber":"5071833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5071832","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5071833","articleId":"5071845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5071853,"authors":[{"name":"Agostino Forestiero","affiliation":["ICAR-CNR, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Agostino","lastName":"Forestiero","id":"37303791800"},{"name":"Carlo Mastroianni","affiliation":["ICAR-CNR, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Mastroianni","id":"37273322500"},{"name":"Michela Meo","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Michela","lastName":"Meo","id":"37269524300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3935-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3622-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5071853","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"abstract":"This paper presents ldquoSelf-Chordrdquo, a bio-inspired P2P algorithm that can be profitably adopted to build the information service of distributed systems, in particular Computational Grids and Clouds.

This performance demand has been satisfied without paying much attention to power/energy consumption. Consequently, that has become a major concern in high-performance computing systems. In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling precedence-constrained parallel applications on such systems-specifically with heterogeneous resources-accounting for both application completion time and energy consumption. Our scheduling algorithm adopts dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) to minimize energy consumption. DVS can be used with a number of recent commodity processors that are enabled to operate in different voltage supply levels at the expense of sacrificing clock frequencies. In the context of scheduling, this multiple voltage facility implies that there is a trade-off between the quality of schedules and energy consumption. Our algorithm effectively balances these two performance goals using a novel objective function, which takes into account both goals; this claim is verified by the results obtained from our extensive comparative evaluation study.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Dynamic voltage scaling","Processor scheduling","Voltage control","Scheduling algorithm","Frequency","Computer networks","Grid computing","Clocks","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel processing","power aware computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption minimization","precedence-constrained parallel application scheduling","dynamic voltage scaling","high-performance computing system","heterogeneous resource","DVS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scheduling","Energy awareness","Dynamic voltage scaling","heterogeneous computing systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071859","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2009.16","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5071832/5071833/05071859.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2009.16","startPage":"92","endPage":"99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071833","publicationTitle":"2009 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing Energy Consumption for Precedence-Constrained Applications Using Dynamic Voltage Scaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing Energy Consumption for Precedence-Constrained Applications Using Dynamic Voltage Scaling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071859/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071859/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703275","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing Energy Consumption for Precedence-Constrained Applications Using Dynamic Voltage Scaling","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3622a092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060795S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5071832","isNumber":"5071833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5071832","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5071833","articleId":"5071859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5071861,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311517600"},{"name":"Rajkumar Buyya","affiliation":["GRIDS Laboratory Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Rajkumar","lastName":"Buyya","id":"37267557900"},{"name":"Jinshu Su","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jinshu","lastName":"Su","id":"37311469100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3935-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3622-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5071861","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Grid computing","Processor scheduling","Application software","Acceleration","Genetic mutations","Distributed computing","Peer to peer computing","Educational institutions","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","scheduling","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability-oriented genetic algorithm","max-min strategy","workflow applications","look-ahead genetic algorithm","task-resource mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["workflow","genetic algorithm","reliability","max-min","hruristic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071861","abstract":"To optimize makespan and reliability for workflow applications, most existing works use list heuristics rather than genetic algorithms (GAs) which can usually give better solutions.

In this paper, we define three heuristics for GAs to decide the priorities for a resource and a task dynamically. We propose look-ahead genetic algorithm (LAGA) to optimize both makespan and reliability for workflow applications. It uses a novel evolution and evaluation mechanism: the genetic operators evolve the task-resource mapping for a scheduling solution, while the solutionpsilas task order is determined in the evaluation step using our new max-min strategy, which is specifically proposed for GAs. Our experiments show that LAGA can provide better solutions than existing list heuristics and evolve to better solutions more quickly than a traditional genetic algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2009.14","publicationTitle":"2009 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5071832/5071833/05071861.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2009.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability-Oriented Genetic Algorithm for Workflow Applications Using Max-Min Strategy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-Oriented Genetic Algorithm for Workflow Applications Using Max-Min Strategy","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10717239","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071861/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071861/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-Oriented Genetic Algorithm for Workflow Applications Using Max-Min Strategy","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3622a108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075889S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5071832","isNumber":"5071833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5071832","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5071833","articleId":"5071861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5071862,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37310458000"},{"name":"Charles Koelbel","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Koelbel","id":"37284701400"},{"name":"Keith Cooper","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Cooper","id":"37284697800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3935-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3622-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5071862","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071862","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Grid computing","Application software","Dynamic scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Monitoring","Large-scale systems","Feedback","Power system modeling","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","optimisation","parallel algorithms","workstation clusters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid rescheduling mechanism","workflow scheduling mechanism","multicluster grid computing","optimization","static scheduling algorithm","parallel environment","execution monitor","real-time feedback","phase migration mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grid Computing","Workflow Scheduling","Dynamic Scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Grid computing is now a viable computational paradigm for executing large scale workflow applications.

Since a typical grid environment is dynamic, we propose a new cluster-based scheduling mechanism that dynamically executes a top-down static scheduling algorithm using the real-time feedback from the execution monitor.

In this work, we present Eucalyptus - an open-source software framework for cloud computing that implements what is commonly referred to as infrastructure as a service (IaaS); systems that give users the ability to run and control entire virtual machine instances deployed across a variety physical resources. We outline the basic principles of the Eucalyptus design, detail important operational aspects of the system, and discuss architectural trade-offs that we have made in order to allow EUCALYPTUS to be portable, modular and simple to use on infrastructure commonly found within academic settings. Finally, we provide evidence that EUCALYPTUS enables users familiar with existing grid and HPC systems to explore new cloud computing functionality while maintaining access to existing, familiar application development software and grid middleware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703277","htmlLink":"/document/5071863/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Eucalyptus Open-Source Cloud-Computing System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Eucalyptus Open-Source Cloud-Computing System","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3622a124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058018S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5071832","isNumber":"5071833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5071832","citationCount":"870","xplore-issue":"5071833","articleId":"5071863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5071877,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Jin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Jin","id":"37308381100"},{"name":"Xian-He Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Xian-He","lastName":"Sun","id":"37276409100"},{"name":"Ziming Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ziming","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37310743700"},{"name":"Zhiling Lan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiling","lastName":"Lan","id":"37314459500"},{"name":"Bing Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Xie","id":"37304785900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3935-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3622-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5071877","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071877","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Failure analysis","Optimization","Large-scale systems","Performance analysis","Guidelines","Predictive models","Iterative methods","Stochastic processes","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","optimisation","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DAG-based parallel computing","parallel system complexity","directed acyclic graph","performance optimization","iterative approach","layered DAG","stochastic analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault-Tolerance","Failuer Modeling","Applicaiton Perfomrance","Directed Acyclic Graph"]}],"abstract":"As the scale and complexity of parallel systems continue to grow, failures become more and more an inevitable fact for solving large-scale applications. In this research, we present an analytical study to estimate execution time in the presence of failures of directed acyclic graph (DAG) based scientific applications and provide a guideline for performance optimization. The study is four fold. We first introduce a performance model to predict individual subtask computation time under failures. Next, a layered, iterative approach is adopted to transform a DAG into a layered DAG, which reflects full dependencies among all the subtasks. Then, the expected execution time under failures of the DAG is derived based on stochastic analysis. Unlike existing models, this newly proposed performance model provides both the variance and distribution. It is practical and can be put to real use. Finally, based on the model, performance optimization, weak point identification and enhancement are proposed. Intensive simulations with real system traces are conducted to verify the analytical findings.

We design a reconfigurable distributed virtual machine (RDVM) infrastructure for clusters computing. We propose failure-aware node selection strategies for the construction and reconfiguration of RDVMs. We leverage the proactive failure management techniques in calculating nodes' reliability status. We consider both the performance and reliability status of compute nodes in making selection decisions. We define a capacity-reliability metric to combine the effects of both factors in node selection, and propose best-fit algorithms to find the best qualified nodes on which to instantiate VMs to run parallel jobs. We have conducted experiments using failure traces from production clusters and the NAS parallel benchmark programs on a real cluster. The results show the enhancement of system productivity and dependability by using the proposed strategies. With the best-fit strategies, the job completion rate is increased by 17.6% compared with that achieved in the current LANL HPC cluster, and the task completion rate reaches 91.7%.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2009.21","publicationTitle":"2009 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5071832/5071833/05071894.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2009.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure-Aware Construction and Reconfiguration of Distributed Virtual Machines for High Availability Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071894/","displayDocTitle":"Failure-Aware Construction and Reconfiguration of Distributed Virtual Machines for High Availability Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703303","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071894/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure-Aware Construction and Reconfiguration of Distributed Virtual Machines for High Availability Computing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3622a372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102222S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5071832","isNumber":"5071833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5071832","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5071833","articleId":"5071894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5071905,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Hirofuchi","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Hirofuchi","id":"37320964500"},{"name":"Hirotaka Ogawa","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirotaka","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"37856999600"},{"name":"Hidemoto Nakada","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidemoto","lastName":"Nakada","id":"37270080600"},{"name":"Satoshi Itoh","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Itoh","id":"37305397700"},{"name":"Satoshi Sekiguchi","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Sekiguchi","id":"37270043900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3935-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3622-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5071905","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":19,"totalDownloads":848},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071905","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wide area networks","Virtual machining","Virtual manufacturing","Voice mail","Hardware","Prototypes","Cloud computing","File servers","Switches","Load management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","storage management","user interfaces","virtual machines","Web services","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["live storage migration mechanism","virtualized data centers","cloud computing","dynamic virtual machine migration","advanced storage access mechanism","on-demand fetching","background copying","WAN environment","infrastructure-as-a-service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Virtual Machine","Live Migration","Cloud Computing","IaaS","Storage","iSCSI"]}],"abstract":"IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) is an emerging concept of cloud computing, which allows users to obtain hardware resources from virtualized data centers. Although many commercial IaaS clouds have recently been launched, dynamic virtual machine (VM) migration is not possible among service providers; users are locked into a particular provider, and cannot transparently relocate their VMs to another one for the best cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an advanced storage access mechanism that strongly supports live VM migration over WAN. It rapidly relocates VM disks between source and destination sites with the minimum impact on I/O performance. The proposed mechanism addresses I/O consistency of virtual disks before/after migration, which is the major issue regarding wide-area live migration. The proposed mechanism works as a storage server of a block-level storage I/O protocol (e.g.,iSCSI and NBD). Two key techniques (on-demand fetching and background copying) move on-line virtual disks among remote sites, transparently and efficiently. Our prototype system works perfectly for Xen and KVM without any modification to them. Experiments showed the prototype system also worked successfully for an emulated WAN environment.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2009.44","publicationTitle":"2009 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5071832/5071833/05071905.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2009.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Live Storage Migration Mechanism over WAN for Relocatable Virtual Machine Services on Clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Live Storage Migration Mechanism over WAN for Relocatable Virtual Machine Services on Clouds","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703237","htmlLink":"/document/5071905/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Live Storage Migration Mechanism over WAN for Relocatable Virtual Machine Services on Clouds","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3622a460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044601S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5071832","isNumber":"5071833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5071832","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5071833","articleId":"5071905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5071949,"authors":[{"name":"Zuzana Oplatkov\u00e1","affiliation":["Faculty of Applied Informatics, Tomas Bata University, Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zuzana","lastName":"Oplatkov\u00e1","id":"37297556900"},{"name":"Jiri Holoska","affiliation":["Faculty of Applied Informatics, Tomas Bata University, Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jiri","lastName":"Holoska","id":"37303845000"},{"name":"Ivan Zelinka","affiliation":["Faculty of Applied Informatics, Tomas Bata University, Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Zelinka","id":"37297560100"},{"name":"Roman Senkerik","affiliation":["Faculty of Applied Informatics, Tomas Bata University, Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Senkerik","id":"37303844400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4154-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3648-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-1164"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-1172"}],"articleNumber":"5071949","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":644},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071949","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steganography","Neural networks","Cryptography","Decoding","Frequency","Asia","Informatics","Videos","Graphics","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","object detection","steganography","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steganography detection","neural networks","cryptography","OutGuess program","Steghide program","taxonomist"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["steganography","detection","neural networks","OutGuess","Steghide"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AMS.2009.28","pdfPath":"/iel5/5071934/5071935/05071949.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Third Asia International Conference on Modelling & Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third Asia International Conference on Modelling & Simulation","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMS.2009.28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Steganography Inserted by OutGuess and Steghide by Means of Neural Networks","abstract":"The paper deals with detection of steganography content.

The most widespread approach for constrained search problems is to use penalty methods, because of their simplicity and ease of implementation. Nonetheless, the most difficult aspect of the penalty function approach is to find an appropriate penalty parameters. In this paper, a method combining the new non-dominated ranked genetic algorithm (NRGA), with a parameterless penalty approach are exploited to devise the search to find Pareto optimal set of solutions. The new parameterless penalty and the nondominated ranked genetic algorithm (PP-NRGA) continuously find better Pareto optimal set of solutions.

A major problem is due to inconsistencies in human behavior which require more robust algorithms in their developments. In this paper, an online signature verification system is proposed based on neural networks classifier and fuzzy inference. The software has been developed with a robust validation module based on Pearsonpsilas correlation algorithm in which more consistent sets of userpsilas signature are enrolled. In this way, more consistent sets of training patterns are used to train the neural network modules based on the popular back-propagation algorithm. To increase the robustness not only the neural network threshold is used for the verification, the time and length of the signature are also calculated. A fuzzy inference module is then set up to infer the three thresholds for human-like decision outputs. The signature verification system shows better consistency and is more robust than previous designs.","doi":"10.1109/AMS.2009.23","startPage":"236","endPage":"241","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third Asia International Conference on Modelling & Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5071934/5071935/05071989.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Third Asia International Conference on Modelling & Simulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMS.2009.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Signature Verification with Neural Networks Classifier and Fuzzy Inference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks","Robustness","Inference algorithms","Biometrics","Fingerprint recognition","Retina","Humans","Fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","correlation methods","fuzzy reasoning","handwriting recognition","image classification","neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online signature verification system","neural network classifier","fuzzy inference module","physiologically-based biometric system","behavioral-based biometric system","Pearson correlation algorithm","training pattern","backpropagation algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Online Signature Verification with Neural Networks Classifier and Fuzzy Inference","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071989/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703330","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Signature Verification with Neural Networks Classifier and Fuzzy Inference","confLoc":"Bundang, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"3648a236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062603S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5071934","isNumber":"5071935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5071934","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5071935","articleId":"5071989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5071991,"authors":[{"name":"Tri Basuki Kurniawan","affiliation":["Centre of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO), Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Tri Basuki","lastName":"Kurniawan","id":"37303795200"},{"name":"Zuwairie Ibrahim","affiliation":["Centre of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO), Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zuwairie","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37303868100"},{"name":"Noor Khafifah Khalid","affiliation":["Centre of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO), Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Noor Khafifah","lastName":"Khalid","id":"37312371900"},{"name":"Marzuki Khalid","affiliation":["Centre of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO), Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Marzuki","lastName":"Khalid","id":"37298288700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4154-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3648-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-1164"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-1172"}],"articleNumber":"5071991","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ant colony optimization","Sequences","DNA computing","Evolutionary computation","Asia","Artificial intelligence","Intelligent robots","Turing machines","Uniform resource locators","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biology computing","DNA","molecular biophysics","optimisation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["population-based ant colony optimization","DNA sequence optimization","DNA computing","bio-molecular","information storage media","biochemical tool","information processing operator","probabilistic reaction","meta-heuristic algorithm","chemical reaction"]}],"abstract":"DNA computing is a new computing paradigm which uses bio-molecular as information storage media and biochemical tools as information processing operators. It has shows many successful and promising results for various applications. Since DNA reactions are probabilistic reactions, it can cause the different results for the same situations, which can be regarded as errors in the computation. To overcome the drawbacks, much works have focused to design the error-minimized DNA sequences to improve the reliability of DNA computing. In this research, Population-based ACO (P-ACO) is proposed to solve the DNA sequence optimization. P-ACO approach is a meta-heuristic algorithm that uses some ants to obtain the solutions based on the pheromone in their colony. The DNA sequence design problem is modelled by four nodes, representing four DNA bases (A, T, C, and G). The results from the proposed algorithm are compared with other sequence design methods, which are Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) methods. The DNA sequences optimized by the proposed approach have better result in some objective functions than the other methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Population-Based Ant Colony Optimization Approach for DNA Sequence Optimization","publicationTitle":"2009 Third Asia International Conference on Modelling & Simulation","doi":"10.1109/AMS.2009.79","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third Asia International Conference on Modelling & Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5071934/5071935/05071991.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMS.2009.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5071991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5071991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Population-Based Ant Colony Optimization Approach for DNA Sequence Optimization","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5071991/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703331","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Population-Based Ant Colony Optimization Approach for DNA Sequence Optimization","confLoc":"Bundang, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"3648a246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067745S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5071934","isNumber":"5071935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5071934","xplore-issue":"5071935","articleId":"5071991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5072006,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Reza Zare","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Zare","id":"37311736100"},{"name":"Raja Noor Ainon","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Raja Noor","lastName":"Ainon","id":"37265986900"},{"name":"Woo Chaw Seng","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Woo Chaw","lastName":"Seng","id":"38231407200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4154-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3648-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-1164"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-1172"}],"articleNumber":"5072006","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image retrieval","Content based retrieval","Blood","Cells (biology)","Shape","Indexing","Computer science","Prototypes","Humans","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","blood","content-based retrieval","image colour analysis","image retrieval","image texture","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based image retrieval","blood cells","content-based image indexing","wavelet decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Text-based Image Retrieval (TBIR)","Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR)","Blood cell images"]}],"abstract":"The rapid development of technologies and steadily growing amounts of digital information highlight the need of developing an accessing system.

In addition, morphological operations such as opening and closing are applied to analyze object shape.

Therefore, it is important to develop tools for teaching kids about Jawi characters and speech-to-text (STT) application can serve this purpose well. Unlike English, Jawi uses special characters similar to Arabic characters. However, its pronunciations are in Malay language. This uniqueness makes STT development a challenging task. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of linear predictive coding to extract important features from voice signal and neural network with backpropagation to classify and recognize spoken words into Jawi characters. A total of 225 samples of words in Jawi characters are recorded from speakers with over 95% accuracy.

This list-scheduling algorithm considers the variation of the critical paths in the DAG statistically whereby the MCPD algorithm attempts to schedule tasks on the processor according to the importance of the parent.

In this paper, we present and compare different feedback schemes for cognitive radio and study the channel capacity when an imperfect feedback link is corrupted by noise and delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072069/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10717308","publicationDate":"May 2009","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072069/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"CSI Feedback Model in the Context of Adaptive Cognitive Radio Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSI Feedback Model in the Context of Adaptive Cognitive Radio Systems","confLoc":"Bundang, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"3648a681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063862S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5071934","isNumber":"5071935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5071934","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5071935","articleId":"5072069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5072076,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Singh Kushwah","affiliation":["Amity School of Engineering and Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Vivek Singh","lastName":"Kushwah","id":"37303065700"},{"name":"Geetam Singh Tomar","affiliation":["Vikrant Institute of Technology and Management, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Geetam Singh","lastName":"Tomar","id":"37297331200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4154-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3648-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-1164"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-1172"}],"articleNumber":"5072076","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":638},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","Patch antennas","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Resonant frequency","Dielectric substrates","Dielectric constant","Dielectric materials","Solid modeling","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical engineering computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip patch antenna design","artificial neural networks","rectangular patch geometry","neural network training algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","artificial neural networks","reverse modeling","patch antenna"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072076","abstract":"This paper presents the general design of microstrip antennas using artificial neural networks for rectangular patch geometry.

In a conventional multicast system, the source station transmits at the base rate of the underlying network so that all the nodes can receive the data correctly. The performance of such a multicast system is limited by the node with the worst channel conditions, which usually corresponds to the nodes at the edge of the multicast coverage range. To overcome this problem, we propose a two-hop cooperative transmission scheme where in the first hop the source station transmits the packets and the nodes who receive the packets forward the packets simultaneously in the second hop using randomized distributed space time codes (R-DSTC). We further integrate this randomized cooperative transmission with layered video coding to provide users different video quality based on their channel conditions. The performance of the system is evaluated and compared with a conventional multicast system. Our results show that the proposed cooperative system significantly improves the performance compared to conventional multicast.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOMW.2009.5072122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072090","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM Workshops 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072089/5072090/05072122.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Layered Video Multicast Using Randomized Distributed Space Time Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5072122/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Layered Video Multicast Using Randomized Distributed Space Time Codes","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10703391","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Layered Video Multicast Using Randomized Distributed Space Time Codes","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"PID860227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061761S","chronDate":"19-25 April 2009","isNumber":"5072090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072089","citationCount":"26","articleId":"5072122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5072212,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Steinicke","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of M\u00fcnster, Munster, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/5331922/5072212/5072212-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frank Steinicke received the PhD degree in computer science from the University of M\u00fcnster in 2006.

Usually, movements in the real world are mapped one-to-one to virtual camera motions. With redirection techniques, the virtual camera is manipulated by applying gains to user motion so that the virtual world moves differently than the real world. Thus, users can walk through large-scale IVEs while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace. In psychophysical experiments with a two-alternative forced-choice task, we have quantified how much humans can unknowingly be redirected on physical paths that are different from the visually perceived paths. We tested 12 subjects in three different experiments: (E1) discrimination between virtual and physical rotations, (E2) discrimination between virtual and physical straightforward movements, and (E3) discrimination of path curvature. In experiment E1, subjects performed rotations with different gains, and then had to choose whether the visually perceived rotation was smaller or greater than the physical rotation. In experiment E2, subjects chose whether the physical walk was shorter or longer than the visually perceived scaled travel distance. In experiment E3, subjects estimate the path curvature when walking a curved path in the real world while the visual display shows a straight path in the virtual world. Our results show that users can be turned physically about 49 percent more or 20 percent less than the perceived virtual rotation, distances can be downscaled by 14 percent and upscaled by 26 percent, and users can be redirected on a circular arc with a radius greater than 22 m while they believe that they are walking straight.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.62","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5331922/05072212.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Detection Thresholds for Redirected Walking Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Detection Thresholds for Redirected Walking Techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072212/","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10975602","pubMedId":"19910658","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072212/","volume":"16","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Detection Thresholds for Redirected Walking Techniques","sourcePdf":"ttg2010010017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124907S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5331922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"214","xplore-issue":"5331922","articleId":"5072212","onlineDate":"12 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5072216,"authors":[{"name":"Ninghui Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5470218/5072216/5072216-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ninghui Li received the BE degree in computer science from the University of Science and Technology of China in 1993, and the MSc and PhD degrees in computer science from New York University, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

Recently, several authors have recognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of \u2113-diversity has been proposed to address this; \u2113-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least \u2113 well-represented (in Section 2) values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper, we show that \u2113-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a new notion of privacy called \u201ccloseness.\u201d We first present the base model t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We then propose a more flexible privacy model called (n,t)-closeness that offers higher utility. We describe our desiderata for designing a distance measure between two probability distributions and present two distance measures. We discuss the rationale for using closeness as a privacy measure and illustrate its advantages through examples and experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072216/","volume":"22","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5072216/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11341011","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Closeness: A New Privacy Measure for Data Publishing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closeness: A New Privacy Measure for Data Publishing","sourcePdf":"ttk2010070943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12286S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5470218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5470218","articleId":"5072216","onlineDate":"12 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5072224,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5392953/5072224/5072224-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Song received the BE and ME degrees in electrical engineering from Dalian University of Technology, China, and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, in July 2004 and August 2006, respectively.

The challenges induced by the random behaviors of the primary users are investigated in a stochastic network utility maximization framework. For the convex stochastic traffic engineering problem, we propose a fully distributed algorithmic solution which provably converges to the global optimum with probability one. We next extend our framework to the cognitive wireless mesh networks with nonconvex utility functions, where a decentralized algorithmic solution, based on learning automata techniques, is proposed. We show that the decentralized solution converges to the global optimum solution asymptotically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","volume":"9","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11071209","publicationDate":"March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072224/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Traffic Engineering in Multihop Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Traffic Engineering in Multihop Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2010030305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103379S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5392953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5392953","articleId":"5072224","onlineDate":"12 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5072227,"authors":[{"name":"Iulian Pruteanu-Malinici","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5452163/5072227/5072227-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Iulian Pruteanu-Malinici received the BS degree in electrical engineering from the Politehnica University of Bucharest, Romania, in 2002, and the MS and PhD degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.

The proposed SVC-based approach combines the calculation of the support vectors, carried out by using a classical procedure adopting a Gaussian kernel, with a specifically developed deterministic algorithm to form the clusters. This algorithm exploits the meaningful location of the bounded support vectors (BSVs) to define the outliers, identifying the clusters in function of the distance of the non-BSVs to the BSVs. Its implementation is less computationally intensive than other existing approaches and the cluster formation is driven by a single user-defined threshold. Extended comparison to other clustering methods is included to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in grouping multidimensional load pattern data into non-overlapping clusters. This effectiveness is confirmed by the calculation of various cluster validity indicators. In particular, the most successful tasks are the identification of the outliers and the more effective formation of small numbers of clusters with respect to other methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Pattern classification","Kernel","Quadratic programming","Static VAr compensators","Clustering algorithms","Lagrangian functions","Clustering methods","Multidimensional systems","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic algorithms","load management","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector clustering","electrical load pattern data","Gaussian kernel","deterministic algorithm","bounded support vectors","customer classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cluster validity","customer classification","electrical load patterns","outlier","support vector clustering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2023009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5170200/05072232.pdf","startPage":"1619","endPage":"1628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2023009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support Vector Clustering of Electrical Load Pattern Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Support Vector Clustering of Electrical Load Pattern Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072232/","volume":"24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072232/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10793410","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support Vector Clustering of Electrical Load Pattern Data","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-chicco-2023009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090987S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5170200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"5170200","articleId":"5072232","onlineDate":"12 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":5072235,"authors":[{"name":"Hee-Ran Ahn","affiliation":["Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5161480/5072235/5072235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hee-Ran Ahn (S'90\u2013M'95\u2013SM'99) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1988, 1990 and 1994, respectively.","From 1991 to 1995, she was a Part-Time Lecturer with Sogang University.

Based on the design equations, a new modified Pi-type transmission-line equivalent circuit is suggested. It consists mainly of a set of coupled-line sections and can be used to reduce a transmission-line section, especially when the electrical length is greater than 180deg. Therefore, the 270deg transmission-line section of a conventional ring hybrid can be reduced to less than 90deg. To verify the performance of the modified one, two kinds of simulations were performed: in the first, the electrical length of the coupled-line sections was held constant, in the second, the coupling coefficient was held constant. Simulated bandwidths of the resulting small transmission lines depended strongly on coupling power. Using modified and conventional Pi-type transmission-line equivalent circuits, a small wideband coupled-line ring hybrid (SWCLRH) was designed. Compared to the conventional ring hybrid, the SWCLRH has much wider bandwidth, but is less than one-third as large. To test the method, a microstrip SWCLRH with a total transmission-line length of 220deg was fabricated and tested.

We present in this paper new computationally efficient cyclic algorithms for MIMO radar waveform synthesis. These algorithms can be used for the design of unimodular MIMO sequences that have very low auto- and cross-correlation sidelobes in a specified lag interval, and of very long sequences that could hardly be handled by other algorithms previously suggested in the literature.

Under reasonable assumptions on the scoring scheme, both of the proposed algorithms are proven to guarantee convergence to a conflict-free assignment, and it is shown that the converged solutions exhibit provable worst-case performance. It is also demonstrated that CBAA and CBBA produce conflict-free feasible solutions that are robust to both inconsistencies in the situational awareness across the fleet and variations in the communication network topology.

The algorithm is essentially a method for obtaining sufficiently sparse solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations with additive Gaussian noise. In general, an underdetermined system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. However, it has been shown that sufficiently sparse solutions can be uniquely identified. Our main objective is to find this unique solution. Our method is based on a novel estimation of source parameters and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of sources. To tackle the great complexity of the MAP algorithm (when the number of sources and mixtures become large), we propose an iterative Bayesian algorithm (IBA). This IBA algorithm is based on the MAP estimation of sources, too, but optimized with a steepest-ascent method. The convergence analysis of the IBA algorithm and its convergence to true global maximum are also proved. Simulation results show that the performance achieved by the IBA algorithm is among the best, while its complexity is rather high in comparison to other algorithms. Simulation results also show the low sensitivity of the IBA algorithm to its simulation parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025154","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5286803/05072251.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"4378","endPage":"4390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Iterative Bayesian Algorithm for Sparse Component Analysis in Presence of Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative Bayesian Algorithm for Sparse Component Analysis in Presence of Noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072251/","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5072251/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918073","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative Bayesian Algorithm for Sparse Component Analysis in Presence of Noise","sourcePdf":"tsp-zayyani-2025154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.353226S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5286803","articleId":"5072251","onlineDate":"12 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5072255,"authors":[{"name":"Joel M.

Next, a simple pure AC flux-linkage measurement method is discussed and evaluated, which does not require a search coil. Experimental results are given, obtained using the described AC method on an SRM and on a PMM. For these two motors, the measured flux-linkage-current curves are compared to those measured using other methods. The comparison results show good effectiveness of the proposed AC method for both the SRM and the PMM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5072281/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816351","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Flux-Linkage Profile Measurement Methods for Switched-Reluctance Motors and Permanent-Magnet Motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Flux-Linkage Profile Measurement Methods for Switched-Reluctance Motors and Permanent-Magnet Motors","sourcePdf":"tim-lu-2017154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.301915S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5200743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5200743","articleId":"5072281","onlineDate":"12 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5072291,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Rankl","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5170198/5072291/5072291-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tobias Rankl received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering and information technology from the University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany, in 2003, where he is currently working towards the Dr.-Ing. degree.","He is a Teaching and Research Staff Member at the Institute of Telecommunications, University of Stuttgart.

In particular, the wall effects on the focused SAR image and the micro-Doppler are formulated and analyzed. These analyses facilitate improving the target recognition performance by quantitatively estimating the parameters of the micro-Doppler signatures as well as the SAR imaging.

Inter-session network coding opportunities at relay nodes depend on packets being overheard by surrounding nodes ? the more packets nodes overhear, the more opportunities relays have to combine packets, resulting in a potential increase in network throughput. Thus, by adapting its transmission rate, a node can increase the range over which its packets are overheard, enabling additional opportunities for coding and increased overall throughput. This paper considers inter-session coding, restricted to a single relay (bottleneck) node, or star network topology. Even for such simple topologies the optimal joint rate adaptation and network coding policy is known to be NP-hard. Optimal rate vector selection is a combinatorial optimization problem, which is NP-hard, and finding optimal coding scheme turns out to be a clique partitioning problem which is also NP-hard. So, we provide heuristics to find a suboptimal rate vector and coding scheme. Additionally, we provide a linear programming formulation for network coding when only pairwise intersession coding is allowed. We evaluate the averaged throughput in two different scenarios, in which relays have different access opportunities, giving some intuition on the impact of rate adaptation in lightly and heavily loaded systems. The gains of joint rate adaptation and network coding are marginal when the relay has a higher access opportunity than other nodes, or when the MAC operates ideally it ranges from 9% to 19% as compared to a network without network coding and 4% over a network using regular network coding. While, when the relay has equal access opportunity as other source nodes, which is more typical of todays MAC protocols under heavy loads, the gain ranges from 40% to 62% as compared to the standard relaying case and is upto around 20% as compared to a network with regular pairwise network coding. This can further be increased to a gain of 40% to 120% by replacing pairwise coding with sub-optimal general network coding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5072299/05072351.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072299","startPage":"635","endPage":"646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Is rate adaptation beneficial for inter-session network coding?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Is rate adaptation beneficial for inter-session network coding?","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10728883","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5072351/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Is rate adaptation beneficial for inter-session network coding?","sourcePdf":"635jsac0509kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064402S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5072299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5072299","articleId":"5072351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5072356,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5072299/5072356/5072356-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Zhang (S'00-M'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from National University of Singapore in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2007.

It is assumed that R receives the sum signal from S1 and S2 in one timeslot, and then amplifies and forwards the received signal to both S1 and S2 in the next time-slot. By applying the principle of analogue network coding (ANC), each of S1 and S2 cancels the so-called \"self-interference\" in the received signal from R and then decodes the desired message. Assuming that S1 and S2 are each equipped with a single antenna and R with multi-antennas, this paper analyzes the capacity region of the ANC-based TWRC with linear processing (beamforming) at R. The capacity region contains all the achievable bidirectional rate-pairs of S1 and S2 under the given transmit power constraints at S1, S2, and R. We present the optimal relay beamforming structure as well as an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal beamforming matrix based on convex optimization techniques. Low-complexity suboptimal relay beamforming schemes are also presented, and their achievable rates are compared against the capacity with the optimal scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090611","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5072299/05072356.pdf","startPage":"699","endPage":"712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal beamforming for two-way multi-antenna relay channel with analogue network coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal beamforming for two-way multi-antenna relay channel with analogue network coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072356/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10704364","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072356/","volume":"27","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal beamforming for two-way multi-antenna relay channel with analogue network coding","sourcePdf":"699jsac0509zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141083S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5072299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"462","xplore-issue":"5072299","articleId":"5072356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5072357,"authors":[{"name":"Hulya Seferoglu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5072299/5072357/5072357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hulya Seferoglu (SM '04) received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Istanbul University, Turkey, in 2003 and M.S degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Sabanci University, Turkey in 2005.

We build upon recent work, which demonstrated that network coding can increase throughput over a broadcast medium, by mixing packets from different flows into a single packet, thus increasing the information content per transmission. Our key insight is that, when the transmitted flows are video streams, network codes should be selected so as to maximize not only the network throughput but also the video quality. We propose video-aware opportunistic network coding schemes that take into account both the decodability of network codes by several receivers and the importance and deadlines of video packets. Simulation results show that our schemes significantly improve both video quality and throughput. This work is a first step towards content-aware network coding.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5072299/05072357.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072299","startPage":"713","endPage":"728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video-aware opportunistic network coding over wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Video-aware opportunistic network coding over wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10704365","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5072357/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video-aware opportunistic network coding over wireless networks","sourcePdf":"713jsac0509seferoglu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09303S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5072299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5072299","articleId":"5072357","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5072361,"authors":[{"name":"Kejie Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Puerto Rico, Mayag\u00dcez, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5072299/5072361/5072361-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dr. Kejie Lu (S'01-M'04-SM'07) received the BSc and MSc degrees in telecommunications engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1994 and 1997, respectively.

Most existing studies were based on the assumption that each transmission involves only one transmitter in order to avoid interference. However, recent studies on physical-layer network coding (PLNC) have shown that such an assumption can be relaxed to improve throughput performance of a wireless network. In PLNC, signals from different senders can be transmitted to the same receiver in the same channel simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate the impact of PLNC on throughput capacity of a random wireless network. Our study reveals that, although PLNC scheme does not change the scaling law, it can improve throughput capacity by a fixed factor. Specifically, for a one-dimensional network, we observe that PLNC can eliminate the effect of interference in some scenarios. A tighter capacity bound is derived for a two-dimensional network. In addition, we also show achievable lower bounds for random wireless networks with network coding and PLNC.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5072299/05072361.pdf","startPage":"763","endPage":"772","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On capacity of random wireless networks with physical-layer network coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"On capacity of random wireless networks with physical-layer network coding","volume":"27","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5072361/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10704355","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On capacity of random wireless networks with physical-layer network coding","sourcePdf":"763jsac0509lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080288S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5072299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5072299","articleId":"5072361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5072362,"authors":[{"name":"Toshiaki Koike-Akino","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5072299/5072362/5072362-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Toshiaki Koike-Akino received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering, M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communications and computer engineering from Kyoto University in 2002, 2003 and 2005, respectively.

We consider network coding based on denoise-and-forward (DNF) protocol, which consists of two stages: multiple access (MA) stage, where two terminals transmit simultaneously towards a relay, and broadcast (BC) stage, where the relay transmits towards the both terminals. We introduce a design principle of modulation and network coding, considering the superposed constellations during the MA stage. For the case of QPSK modulations at the MA stage, we show that QPSK constellations with an exclusive-or (XOR) network coding do not always offer the best transmission for the BC stage, and that there are several channel conditions in which unconventional 5-ary constellations lead to a better throughput performance. Through the use of sphere packing, we optimize the constellation for such an irregular network coding. We further discuss the design issue of the modulation in the case when the relay exploits diversity receptions such as multiple-antenna diversity and path diversity in frequency-selective fading. In addition, we apply our design strategy to a relaying system using higher-level modulations of 16QAM in the MA stage. Performance evaluations confirm that the proposed scheme can significantly improve end-to-end throughput for two-way relaying systems.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090617","startPage":"773","endPage":"787","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5072299/05072362.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized constellations for two-way wireless relaying with physical network coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimized constellations for two-way wireless relaying with physical network coding","volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10704356","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5072362/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized constellations for two-way wireless relaying with physical network coding","sourcePdf":"773jsac0509koike.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106771S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5072299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"387","xplore-issue":"5072299","articleId":"5072362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5072363,"authors":[{"name":"Shengli Zhang","affiliation":["Communication Engineering Department, Shenzhen University, China","Information Engineering Department, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5072299/5072363/5072363-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhang Shengli received his B.

In this paper, we present a network coding-based protection technique that overcomes the deficiencies of the traditional schemes. We derive and prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for our solution on a restricted network topology. Then we relax these connectivity requirements and show how to generalize the sufficient and necessary conditions to work with any other topology. We also show how to perform deterministic coding with {0,1} coefficients to achieve linear independence. Moreover, we discuss some of the practical considerations related to our approach. Specifically, we show how to adapt our solution when the network has a limited min-cut; we therefore define a more general problem that takes this constraint into account, which prove to be NP-complete. Furthermore, we discuss the decoding process at the sink, and show how to make use of our solution in the upstream communication (from sink to sources). We also study the effect of the proposed scheme on network performance. Finally, we consider the implementation of our approach when all network nodes have single transceivers, and we solve the problem through a greedy algorithm that constructs a feasible schedule for the transmissions from the sources.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090619","startPage":"797","endPage":"813","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5072299/05072364.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network coding-based protection of many-to-one wireless flows","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Network coding-based protection of many-to-one wireless flows","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072364/","accessionNumber":"10704358","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072364/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network coding-based protection of many-to-one wireless flows","sourcePdf":"797jsac0509alkofahi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101232S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5072299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5072299","articleId":"5072364","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5072368,"authors":[{"name":"Jarmo Lunden","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, SMARAD CoE, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5286803/5072368/5072368-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jarmo Lund\u00e9n (S'04) received the M.Sc.

An existing statistical hypothesis test for the presence of cyclostationarity is extended to multiple cyclic frequencies and its asymptotic distributions are established. Collaborative test statistics are proposed for the fusion of local test statistics of the secondary users, and a censoring technique in which only informative test statistics are transmitted to the fusion center (FC) during the collaborative detection is further proposed for improving energy efficiency in mobile applications. Moreover, a technique for numerical approximation of the asymptotic distribution of the censored FC test statistic is proposed. The proposed tests are nonparametric in the sense that no assumptions on data or noise distributions are required. In addition, the tests allow dichotomizing between the desired signal and interference. Simulation experiments are provided that show the benefits of the proposed cyclostationary approach compared to energy detection, the importance of collaboration among spatially displaced secondary users for overcoming shadowing and fading effects, as well as the reliable performance of the proposed algorithms even in very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes and under strict communication rate constraints for collaboration overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5286803/05072368.pdf","startPage":"4182","endPage":"4195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative Cyclostationary Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072368/","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative Cyclostationary Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Systems","volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918072","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072368/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative Cyclostationary Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"57tsp10-jlunden-2025152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083907S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"5286803","articleId":"5072368","onlineDate":"12 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5072380,"authors":[{"name":"Gordon A.

The most important are the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the European Recommendation E112, both of which require that wireless providers should be able to locate within tens of meters users of emergency calls. In this paper, fingerprinting-based localization depending on SCORE measurements has been addressed in WiMAX networks. Fingerprinting is a good way to overcome signal propagation peculiarities caused by the propagation environment. And using the SCORE values is of great interest because of their availability during the normal operation of a standard modem. The obtained results show that using SCORE values to locate users in WiMAX networks is feasible and provides the required positioning accuracy by most of location-based services (LBS) if fingerprinting-based approaches were used to obtain localization. However, using the received signal strength (RSS) values gives higher accuracy but obtaining them is more difficult and not feasible using the current standard modems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","WiMAX","GSM","Global Positioning System","Antenna measurements","Time measurement","Base stations","Area measurement","Position measurement","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio direction-finding","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprinting-based localization technique","WiMAX network","SCORE measurement","location-based services","Federal Communications Commission","E112 European Recommendation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPS","GSM","mesh networks","LBS","localization","positioning","positioning accuracy","power maps","received signal strength","road network information","RSS","SCORE","timing adjust","timing advance","WiMAX"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICT.2009.83","startPage":"9","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072387/5072388/05072398.pdf","doi":"10.1109/AICT.2009.83","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fingerprinting-Based Localization in WiMAX Networks Depending on SCORE Measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fingerprinting-Based Localization in WiMAX Networks Depending on SCORE Measurements","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10703477","publicationDate":"May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5072398/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprinting-Based Localization in WiMAX Networks Depending on SCORE Measurements","confLoc":"Venice/Mestre, Italy","sourcePdf":"3611a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07238S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072387","isNumber":"5072388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072387","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5072388","articleId":"5072398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5072410,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Stasiak","affiliation":["Communication and Computer Networks, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Stasiak","id":"37320909300"},{"name":"Piotr Zwierzykowski","affiliation":["Communication and Computer Networks, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Zwierzykowski","id":"37320910200"},{"name":"Janusz Wiewi\u00f3ra","affiliation":["BSS Optimization Section, Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa Sp. z o. o., Warszawa, Poland"],"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Wiewi\u00f3ra","id":"37320908800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3840-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3611-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5072410","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Multiaccess communication","3G mobile communication","Traffic control","Resource management","Telecommunication traffic","Packet switching","GSM","Communications technology","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WCDMA radio interface","UMTS network","user differentiation","group servicing multirate traffic","resource management","3G mobile networks","wideband code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analytical model","priorities","WCDMA"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents an approximate method for modeling of the WCDMA interface in the UMTS network in which the mobile operator introduces priorities and user differentiation.

Although such technique provides an extremely effective PAPR reduction, the receiver has not been previously considered in previous research under the assumption of no side information. The transmission data with side information is considered as a drawback, especially when this technique increases the data rate due to the use of channel codes. This also results in a high system complexity and transmission delay. In this proposal, dSLM recovery is modified for zero-forcing (ZF) and zero-forcing-vertical Bell Labs layered space-time (ZF-V-BLAST) schemes. The contribution in this paper is twofold; firstly, the transmitted phase vector is recovered without side information whilst maintaining bit error rate performance. Secondly, receiver complexity is reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072387/5072388/05072423.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/AICT.2009.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICT.2009.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072388","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Recovery of dSLM in MIMO-OFDM without Side Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","MIMO","Bit error rate","Diversity reception","Solid modeling","Power amplifiers","Power engineering computing","Telecommunication computing","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM","directed selected mapping","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","radio receiver","channel codes","zero forcing","vertical Bell Labs layered space-time scheme","ZF-V-BLAST","bit error rate","receiver complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Selected Mapping","Peak-to-Average Power Ratio","MIMO","OFDM","Zero-Forcing","V-BLAST"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Recovery of dSLM in MIMO-OFDM without Side Information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072423/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703501","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Recovery of dSLM in MIMO-OFDM without Side Information","confLoc":"Venice/Mestre, Italy","sourcePdf":"3611a158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056946S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072387","isNumber":"5072388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072387","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5072388","articleId":"5072423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5072427,"authors":[{"name":"Muayad S.

To reduce intersymbol interference (ISI), a minimum-mean-squared-error decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) is used. In order to select the appropriate modulation mode, the receiver estimates the MSE at the equalizer output. This estimated MSE is then sent back to the transmitter which adjusts the modulation level. Simulation results illustrate that the MSE is accurately estimated and represents a viable switching metric. It is also shown that switching between different modulation modes does not affect the equalizer coefficients adaptation. Linear region of practical transmitter amplifiers is limited. Thus when switching from one modulation scheme to an another, it is important to control the peak power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5072432/","accessionNumber":"10703509","displayDocTitle":"On Combining Adaptive Modulation and Unbiased MMSE-DFE Receiver to Increase the Capacity of Frequency Selective Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Combining Adaptive Modulation and Unbiased MMSE-DFE Receiver to Increase the Capacity of Frequency Selective Channels","confLoc":"Venice/Mestre, Italy","sourcePdf":"3611a203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043272S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072387","isNumber":"5072388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072387","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5072388","articleId":"5072432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5072440,"authors":[{"name":"Stephanie Sahuguede","affiliation":["XLIM Department-C2S2 UMR CNRS 6172, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Sahuguede","id":"38270325800"},{"name":"Anne Julien-Vergonjanne","affiliation":["XLIM Department-C2S2 UMR CNRS 6172, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Julien-Vergonjanne","id":"38273487100"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Cances","affiliation":["XLIM Department-C2S2 UMR CNRS 6172, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Cances","id":"37281346000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3840-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3611-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5072440","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical distributions","Optical noise","Multiple access interference","Multiaccess communication","Degradation","System performance","Performance analysis","Gaussian noise","Statistical analysis","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","code division multiplexing","error statistics","light interference","optical fibre communication","optical noise","statistical distributions","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OCDMA channel statistics","chi-square distribution","optical code division multiple access system","multiple access interference","photodetection process","noise statistics","probability density function","decision variable","beat noise impact","error probability expression","MAI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OCDMA","optical channel","mixture of chi-square statistic"]}],"abstract":"Optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) systems, intensively investigated these last years, are known to suffer from multiple access interference (MAI). In addition, the photodetection process leads to beatings between the desired user information and the interferer ones, strongly degrading the system performance. To simplify the performance analysis, noise statistic is generally approximated by a Gaussian distribution which is not very accurate regarding to optical considerations. In this paper, by considering beat noise along with MAI, we develop a more precise analysis of the probability density function of the decision variable as a mixture of chi-square distributions. To investigate beat noise impact, the theoretical error probability expression is then determined. The results permit obtaining the conditions required to reach the optimal performance in beat noise corrupted OCDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/AICT.2009.49","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072387/5072388/05072440.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICT.2009.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OCDMA Channel Statistic as a Mixture of Chi-Square Distributions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072440/","displayDocTitle":"OCDMA Channel Statistic as a Mixture of Chi-Square Distributions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703516","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072440/","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OCDMA Channel Statistic as a Mixture of Chi-Square Distributions","confLoc":"Venice/Mestre, Italy","sourcePdf":"3611a248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073506S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072387","isNumber":"5072388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072387","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5072388","articleId":"5072440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5072451,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Baldi","affiliation":["DIBET, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Baldi","id":"37063962300"},{"name":"Giovanni Cancellieri","affiliation":["DIBET, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Cancellieri","id":"37299823800"},{"name":"Franco Chiaraluce","affiliation":["DIBET, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Chiaraluce","id":"37273242300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3840-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3611-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5072451","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Redundancy","Encoding","Automatic repeat request","Performance analysis","Forward error correction","Belief propagation","Hardware","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","concatenated codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC codes","low-density parity-check codes","serial concatenation","complexity encoding","type-II hybrid automatic repeat request schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error correcting codes","LDPC codes","serial concatenation"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that can be obtained as the serial concatenation of very simple components.

The transmitted signal is distorted by channel noise and interference from other sources causing bit error. Diversity is a technology to reduce both the effects of channel noise and interference. The diversity technique is used in the two previously mentioned techniques to send data through a fading channel at a high symbol rate. Beamforming technique is used to direct a signal to a particular direction. Recently, it is used in the aforementioned second technique to transmit data at a very high rate with low bit error probability. In this paper, we propose an alternative beamforming algorithm in this second technique to obtain better bit error rate performance for a multi-path fading channel, compared to results reported in earlier work The simulation results of the proposed algorithm also show expected performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICT.2009.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072388","startPage":"351","endPage":"356","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072387/5072388/05072458.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Beamforming Technique in WiMAX","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5072458/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Beamforming Technique in WiMAX","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703533","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Beamforming Technique in WiMAX","confLoc":"Venice/Mestre, Italy","sourcePdf":"3611a351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09267S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072387","isNumber":"5072388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072387","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5072388","articleId":"5072458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5072461,"authors":[{"name":"Liaoyuan Zeng","affiliation":["Wireless Access Research Center, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Liaoyuan","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37306352700"},{"name":"Sean McGrath","affiliation":["Wireless Access Research Center, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"McGrath","id":"37268366100"},{"name":"Eduardo Cano","affiliation":["Institute of the Protection and Security of the Citizen Joint Research Center, European Commission, Ispra Varese, Italy"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Cano","id":"37272105900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3840-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3611-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5072461","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"abstract":"A new design for maximizing the data rate of the multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultra wideband systems is presented. The design is based on the generation of a series of M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation zones for each UWB subcarrier whose levels of fading depend on the UWB channel model. The available transmitted power is then optimally distributed to use the modulation scheme with the maximum M in the subcarriers. The optimization is constrained by the target bit error rate and the limitation of the UWB transmit power spectral density in each subcarrier. The rate maximization has been obtained in a three-step algorithm consisting of M-QAM zones generation, primary and advanced power and bit loading. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed over UWB channel. The results show that the data rate is significantly improved by an advanced power and bit loading scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072387/5072388/05072461.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"374","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/AICT.2009.69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICT.2009.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072388","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate Maximization for Multiband OFDM Ultra Wideband Systems Using Adaptive Power and Bit Loading Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Ultra wideband technology","Adaptive systems","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Fading","Power system modeling","Constraint optimization","Bit error rate","Power generation","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate maximization","ultra wideband systems","UWB channel model","UWB transmit power spectral density","bit loading algorithm","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","target bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Rate Maximization for Multiband OFDM Ultra Wideband Systems Using Adaptive Power and Bit Loading Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072461/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703536","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Maximization for Multiband OFDM Ultra Wideband Systems Using Adaptive Power and Bit Loading Algorithm","confLoc":"Venice/Mestre, Italy","sourcePdf":"3611a369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081126S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072387","isNumber":"5072388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072387","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5072388","articleId":"5072461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5072464,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Most typically the configuration and provisioning of these datacenters, as far as the services for the subscribers go, is highly automated, to the point of the service being delivered within seconds of the subscriber request. Additionally, the datacenters typically use hypervisor based virtualization as a technique to deliver these services. The concept of a cloud operated by one service provider or enterprise interoperating with a clouds operated by another is a powerful idea. So far that is limited to use cases where code running on one cloud explicitly references a service on another cloud. There is no implicit and transparent interoperability. Use cases for interoperability, as well as work-in-progress around inter-cloud protocols and formats for enabling those use cases, are discussed in this paper.","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072479/5072480/05072540.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blueprint for the Intercloud - Protocols and Formats for Cloud Computing Interoperability","doi":"10.1109/ICIW.2009.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIW.2009.55","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Blueprint for the Intercloud - Protocols and Formats for Cloud Computing Interoperability","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10717432","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5072540/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blueprint for the Intercloud - Protocols and Formats for Cloud Computing Interoperability","confLoc":"Venice/Mestre, Italy","sourcePdf":"3613a328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056071S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072479","isNumber":"5072480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072479","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"5072480","articleId":"5072540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5072624,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Yong Yin","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jin-Yong","lastName":"Yin","id":"37307519400"},{"name":"Guo-Chang Guo","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Chang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37307105400"},{"name":"Yan-Xia Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yan-Xia","lastName":"Wu","id":"37311412000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3894-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5072624","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Scheduling algorithm","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Educational institutions","Computer science","Design engineering","Operating systems","Space technology","Ionization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid fault-tolerant scheduling algorithm","partially reconfigurable FPGA","task scheduling","backup copy","primary copy"]}],"abstract":"FPGAs have been used widely in space related design engineers and the probability of fault occurring increases when they are subject to total ionization dose.

In addition, a Cauchy mutation operator conducted on the global best particle is used for improving the global search ability of PSO. Experimental studies on a suite of multimodal functions with many local minima show that the HPSO outperforms the standard PSO, CEP, Gaussian swarm with Gaussian mutation (GPSO+GJ) and Gaussian swarm with Cauchy mutation (GPSO+CJ) on most test functions.","doi":"10.1109/IWISA.2009.5072627","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072598/5072599/05072627.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWISA.2009.5072627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Multimodal Function Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Evolutionary computation","Equations","Software algorithms","Educational institutions","Geography","Computer science","Software engineering","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","evolutionary computation","mathematical operators","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","multimodal function optimization","numerical function problems","premature convergence","velocity model","nonzero velocity","Cauchy mutation operator","global search ability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Multimodal Function Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072627/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-24 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10717558","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Multimodal Function Optimization","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052003S","chronDate":"23-24 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072598","isNumber":"5072599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072598","xplore-issue":"5072599","articleId":"5072627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5072629,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Wu Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Chang-Wu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37310509500"},{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37309295700"},{"name":"Bao-Wen Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Bao-Wen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37310882200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3894-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5072629","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Job shop scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Chaos","Neural networks","Simulated annealing","Hopfield neural networks","Constraint optimization","Resource management","Information science","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","Hopfield neural nets","job shop scheduling","matrix algebra","resource allocation","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["job shop scheduling algorithm","chaotic neural network","resource allocation","simulated annealing method","Hopfield neural network","permutation matrix","operation sequence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072629","abstract":"The job shop scheduling problem is a complicated combination optimization question.

The wavelet theories have given rise to the wavelet thresholding method, for extracting a signal from noisy data. Multi-wavelets can offer simultaneous orthogonality, symmetry and short support, and these properties make multi-wavelets more suitable for various image processing applications, especially denoising. Denoising of images via thresholding of the multi-wavelet coefficients result from pre-processing and the multi-wavelet transform can be carried out by treating the output in this paper. Multi-wavelet transform technique has a big advantage over the other techniques that it less distorts spectral characteristics of the image denoising. The form of the threshold is carefully formulated and is the key to the excellent results obtained in the extensive numerical simulations of image denoising. The experimental results show that multi-wavelet on image denoising schemes outperform wavelet-based method both in subjectively and objectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072598/5072599/05072757.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","doi":"10.1109/IWISA.2009.5072757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWISA.2009.5072757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approach of Image Denoising Based on Discrete Multi-Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image denoising","Discrete transforms","Image processing","Noise reduction","Discrete wavelet transforms","Remote sensing","Finite impulse response filter","Image coding","Computer science","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","geophysical signal processing","image denoising","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete multiwavelet transform","remote sensing image denoising","image processing","spectral characteristic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5072757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Approach of Image Denoising Based on Discrete Multi-Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5072757/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10717827","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"23-24 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approach of Image Denoising Based on Discrete Multi-Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062049S","chronDate":"23-24 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072598","isNumber":"5072599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072598","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5072599","articleId":"5072757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5072770,"authors":[{"name":"Meijuan Gao","affiliation":["College of Automation, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China","School of Information Science, Beijing University of Chemical and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meijuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289044200"},{"name":"Jingwen Tian","affiliation":["College of Automation, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China","School of Information Science, Beijing University of Chemical and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingwen","lastName":"Tian","id":"37290884900"},{"name":"Jin Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science, Beijing University of Chemical and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37309900600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3894-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5072770","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5072770","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logistics","Costs","Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Economic forecasting","Buildings","Predictive models","Convergence","Demand forecasting","Process planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","construction industry","genetic algorithms","neural nets","structural engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building logistics cost forecast","genetic algorithm neural network","floating-point code genetic algorithm","BP network","construction enterprises"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWISA.2009.5072770","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072598/5072599/05072770.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWISA.2009.5072770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building Logistics Cost Forecast Based on High Speed and Precise Genetic Algorithm Neural Network","abstract":"The building logistics cost forecasting was a complicated nonlinear problem, due to the factors that influence building logistics cost are anfratuous, and it was difficult to describe it by traditional methods.

Combining the energy received over multipath, RAKE receiver usually holds good performances in the UWB communications environment. However, interferences from other narrowband systems degrade the bit error rate (BER) performance severely. To suppress the narrowband interference (NBI), a low sampling rate RAKE receiver is proposed. The proposed receiver can be considered as an enhancement of RAKE reception, with reduced ADC sampling rate and high NBI suppressing capability. After discussing the fundamental principle of the proposed receiver, detailed analysis and simulation results are given and BER performance is evaluated under IEEE 802.15.SG3a UWB channel models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-24 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073008/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10717697","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a Low Sampling Rate RAKE UWB Receiver in Multipath Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a Low Sampling Rate RAKE UWB Receiver in Multipath Environments","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049079S","chronDate":"23-24 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072598","isNumber":"5072599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072598","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5072599","articleId":"5073008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5073026,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Wang","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37896956900"},{"name":"Yuru Xu","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yuru","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536009000"},{"name":"Lei Wan","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wan","id":"37398492700"},{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"37538229600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3894-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5073026","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073026","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater vehicles","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Motion control","Control systems","Real time systems","Vehicle dynamics","Digital signal processing","Underwater tracking","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","motion control","neurocontrollers","remotely operated vehicles","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time control","autonomous underwater vehicle","fuzzy neural network","motion control","AUV","desired state planning","sigmoid reference model","multilayered neural network architecture","error back propagation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWISA.2009.5073026","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072598/5072599/05073026.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWISA.2009.5073026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Based on Fuzzy Neural Network","abstract":"A real-time control scheme based on fuzzy neural network (FNN) is proposed for the motion control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in this paper, for which the dynamics of the controlled system need not be completely known. A real-time desired state planning (DSP) based a sigmoid reference model is introduced to assist the FNN to keep the track error in a low level, and that also can serve as teaching signal to guide the training of the network, which makes it possible to implement the real-time motion control with FNN. The designed multilayered neural network architecture involves a modified error back propagation (EBP) as the learning algorithm, which is implemented by using the error at the output of the vehicle instead of that of the network so that the weights can be effectively adjusted to maximally decrease the system error.

When the community evolution achieves the equilibrium state, we exchange some particles between the three different sub-swarms, which can increase the information exchange between the sub-swarms, improve the population diversity and reduce the possibility of getting local extreme value. The results of simulation show that the proposed algorithm in the paper has the better optimization performance than the standard PSO.","doi":"10.1109/IWISA.2009.5073219","pdfPath":"/iel5/5072598/5072599/05073219.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","publicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWISA.2009.5073219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5072599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three Sub-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Three Sub-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10717497","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073219/","conferenceDate":"23-24 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three Sub-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066363S","chronDate":"23-24 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5072598","isNumber":"5072599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5072598","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5072599","articleId":"5073219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5073229,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Dong Shi","affiliation":["Faculty of Management and Administration, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macao SAR, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Dong","lastName":"Shi","id":"37877325000"},{"name":"Yuan-Yuan Pan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yuan-Yuan","lastName":"Pan","id":"37711920200"},{"name":"Jian-Qing Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macao SAR, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Qing","lastName":"Li","id":"37676308300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3894-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3893-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5073229","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Neural networks","Predictive models","Paper technology","Power system modeling","Load forecasting","Technology forecasting","Computer network management","Technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grey systems","neural nets","queueing theory","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["urban short-term traffic forecasting","parallel grey neural network combined model","Macao experience","series grey neural network","inlaid grey neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073229","abstract":"The paper presents three kinds of grey neural network combined model for short-term prediction of urban traffic parameters, which are parallel grey neural network, series grey neural network, and inlaid grey neural network.

Although extensive evaluations are needed because the number of system parameters in MU-MIMO is much larger compared to the single user (SU)-MIMO, the performance of MU-MIMO in actual environments is still not well understood. This paper describes the features and effectiveness of a 16times16 multi-user (MU)- MIMO testbed in an actual indoor environment. Moreover, we propose a simple adaptive modulation scheme for MU-MIMO-OFDM transmission that employs a bit interleaver for the frequency and space domains. Finally, we evaluate the frequency efficiency by obtaining the bit error rate of this testbed in an actual indoor environment. We clarify that 16times4times4-user MU-MIMO transmission using the proposed modulation scheme achieves the frequency utilization of 870 Mbps and 1 Gbps (SNR: 31 and 36 dB) with 20 MHz bandwidth, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073280.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"16x16 Multiuser MIMO Testbed Employing Simple Adaptive Modulation Scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Testing","OFDM modulation","Indoor environments","Bit error rate","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Downlink","Array signal processing","Scheduling algorithm","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","channel capacity","error statistics","indoor radio","MIMO communication","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO system","adaptive modulation scheme","multiple input multiple output system","channel capacity","indoor radio","bit error rate","bit interleaver","frequency-and-space domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"16x16 Multiuser MIMO Testbed Employing Simple Adaptive Modulation Scheme","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073280/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718234","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"16x16 Multiuser MIMO Testbed Employing Simple Adaptive Modulation Scheme","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-11-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046542S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073283,"authors":[{"name":"Tsern-Huei Lee","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsern-Huei","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277271000"},{"name":"Jing-Rong Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jing-Rong","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37393397500"},{"name":"Ming-Chih Huang","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Chih","lastName":"Huang","id":"37929827700"},{"name":"Yu-Wen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Wen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37404514200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073283","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","MIMO","Throughput","OFDM","Interference cancellation","Physical layer","Fading","Bit rate","Transceivers","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","radio networks","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO","OFDM","wireless LAN","WLAN","capacity gain","diversity gain","wireless networks","interference cancellation technique","degree of freedom","multiuser wireless system","multiple wireless stations","access point","antennas"]}],"abstract":"The advanced MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system can provide higher capacity gain or higher diversity gain in modern wireless networks.

In this paper, we consider a scenario where the access point (AP) equipped with two antennas to simultaneously communicate with two STAs, each with single antenna. After obtaining the statuses of the size of buffered traffic and the achievable transmission rate, the AP should pair compatible STAs to minimize the loss of spatial degree of freedom.

The proposed method computes the sliding correlation from both the differential received signal and the differential PN sequence. Rapid symbol timing detection can be obtained based on the correlation peaks. As differential operation is adopted before sliding correlation in the proposed method, the time-dependent linear phase effect caused by the carrier frequency offset will not influence the correlation peaks. Nevertheless, the incorrect correlation peaks caused by the cross terms of the multipath may be detected. An ambiguity protection module is added to validate the correlation peak detection results and further improve the system performance.

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation conditions are assumed in the transmission links from the source mobile station to the destination mobile station via the mobile relay. A stochastic narrowband MIMO M2M reference channel model is derived from the geometrical three-ring scattering model, where it is assumed that an infinite number of local scatterers surround the source mobile station, the mobile relay, and the destination mobile station. The complex channel gains associated with the new reference channel model are derived and their temporal as well as spatial correlation properties are explored. General analytical solutions are presented for the four-dimensional (4-D) space-time cross-correlation function (CCF), the three-dimensional spatial CCF, the two-dimensional (2-D) transmit (relay, receive) correlation function (CF), and the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF). Closed-formed expressions for different CCFs under isotropic scattering conditions are also provided in this paper. The proposed reference channel model can be used as a starting point to develop stochastic and deterministic channel simulators. Such channel simulators are not only important for analyzing the dynamic behavior of the MIMO M2M channel capacity but also for the development of future MIMO M2M cooperative communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073296","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073296.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Geometrical Channel Model for MIMO Mobile-to-Mobile Fading Channels in Cooperative Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073296/","displayDocTitle":"A Geometrical Channel Model for MIMO Mobile-to-Mobile Fading Channels in Cooperative Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718288","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073296/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Geometrical Channel Model for MIMO Mobile-to-Mobile Fading Channels in Cooperative Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"02-05-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058572S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073300,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge Ortin","affiliation":["Arag\u00f3n Institute of Engineering Research, I3A, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Ortin","id":"37545890100"},{"name":"Paloma Garcia","affiliation":["Arag\u00f3n Institute of Engineering Research, I3A, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Paloma","lastName":"Garcia","id":"37275351700"},{"name":"Fernando Gutierrez","affiliation":["Arag\u00f3n Institute of Engineering Research, I3A, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Gutierrez","id":"37333348000"},{"name":"Antonio Valdovinos","affiliation":["Arag\u00f3n Institute of Engineering Research, I3A, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Valdovinos","id":"37284818200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073300","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","OFDM modulation","Bit error rate","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Transmitters","Performance analysis","Receivers","Error correction codes","Modulation coding","Intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","fading channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint coding-precoding scheme","OFDM systems","fading channels","output precoded symbols","channel variability","Doppler spread"]}],"abstract":"In this work we analyse the performance of a joint coding-precoding scheme for OFDM systems over fading channels.

Our scheme shapes the bursts into identical width, places them in column direction and maximally fills the columns by shifting the bursts on different columns. By simulation, we show that the scheme can push the radio resource usage over 95%, which is on average 20% improvement compared with the simple 2D fixed-bin strip packing and 8% improvement with the exhaustive search.

Recently, it has been shown that multi-user scheduling can help to achieve significant throughput gain in addition to the MIMO spatial multiplexing gain. And the capacity-greedy user selection algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance with much lower complexity compared with exhaustive search, due to reduced trial times of possible user combinations. However the computational complexity may be still too high for feasible applications, which depends on the system bandwidth, the number of active users and the number of antennas. In this paper, a novel capacity-greedy user selection scheme is proposed for the multi-user zero-forcing beamforming system, which involves low-complexity approximation for multi-user zero-forcing beamforming capacity. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can reduce the computational complexity of user selection greatly, with slightly performance loss.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073303.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Capacity-Greedy User Selection Scheme for Zero-Forcing Beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073303/","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Capacity-Greedy User Selection Scheme for Zero-Forcing Beamforming","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718295","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Capacity-Greedy User Selection Scheme for Zero-Forcing Beamforming","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-09-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044196S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073304,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Wen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37290544400"},{"name":"Chien-Cheng Kuo","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Cheng","lastName":"Kuo","id":"38184170800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073304","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiple access interference","Power control","Time division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Interference elimination","Throughput","Energy consumption","Digital video broadcasting","Frequency","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","power control","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication congestion control","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low interference time-slicing code assignment","2D-spread MC-DS-CDMA system","code division multiple access","multicarrier direct sequence system","licensed band","unlicensed transmission","time division multiple access","TDMA","frequency-domain spreading code","interference avoidance code assignment","power control mechanism","call admission rate","transmission time intervals"]}],"abstract":"In addition to some design flexibilities, the low interference property of code division multiple access (CDMA) makes multi-carrier direct sequence CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA) suitable for possible unlicensed transmissions in the licensed bands. Introducing the concept of time division multiple access (TDMA) into MC- DS-CDMA may further create a new dimension dealing with the interference problem. In this paper, we proposed a time slicing code assignment for the two-dimensional (2D) spread MC-DS- CDMA. The time slicing technique distributes interference equally over transmission time intervals (TTIs) by assigning users different frequency-domain spreading code groups and transmitting in their corresponding TTIs. Combing with the previous interference avoidance code assignment and power control mechanism for the 2D-spread MC-DS-CDMA, the proposed time slicing scheme is proved to be capable of eliminating interference more efficiently. In terms of the call admission rate, the improvement can be as large as 10% in one of the considered cases. A good operating point of time slicing can also maintain a high throughput, while achieving lower call dropping rate and lower power consumption. The results of this paper can provide some important and interesting hints for the system designers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Interference Time-Slicing Code Assignment for the 2D-Spread MC-DS-CDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073304","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073304.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Low Interference Time-Slicing Code Assignment for the 2D-Spread MC-DS-CDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073304/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718296","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Interference Time-Slicing Code Assignment for the 2D-Spread MC-DS-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-07-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063894S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073305,"authors":[{"name":"Juinn-Horng Deng","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Juinn-Horng","lastName":"Deng","id":"37406883600"},{"name":"Shu-Min Liao","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Min","lastName":"Liao","id":"37396963100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073305","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073305","abstract":"A new differential transceiver with frequency-shift orthogonal keying (FSOK) technique is proposed for the multi- carrier spread spectrum (MC-SS) system over the fast changing frequency selective fading channels. The design of the transceiver involves the following procedures. First, the data stream is mapped into QPSK-FSOK symbols and spreaded by the frequency-shift orthogonal sequences. Second, the differential block encoder is exploited to combat the fast fading channels. The Chu sequence is adapted for the initial differential encoding, which conducts the post-FFT transmitted signal involving the low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) property. Next, at receiver, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) technique is used for the block-based differential frequency-domain equalizer, which can overcome fading channel effect without requiring channel estimation. Finally, an efficient maximum likelihood (ML) despreading and demapping scheme is used to detect the modulation symbols.

This is due to the introduction and refinement of sophisticated communication mechanisms such as multiple input multiple output (MIMO), hybrid ARQ, channel-aware scheduling, or node cooperation. Many of these mechanisms require detailed multi-cell simulation models for their performance evaluation. This involves computationally extensive models of the wireless multi-path fading channel, which quickly becomes a bottleneck with respect to simulation time. It is therefore of great interest to reduce the amount of computation time spent in the channel calculation. In this paper, we present an attractive approach that off loads the channel computation to a massively parallel but inexpensive NVIDIA graphics card. We discuss the parallel architecture of the resulting simulation system, and study the involved synchronization and communication aspects. We show that the developed system achieves a speed-up factor of about 30 compared to an implementation on regular PC hardware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073317/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718328","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Architecture using NVIDIA CUDA to Speed Up Simulation of Multi-Path Fast Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Architecture using NVIDIA CUDA to Speed Up Simulation of Multi-Path Fast Fading Channels","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"10-08-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044569S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5073318,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhou","affiliation":["YRP Research and Development Center, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37273734300"},{"name":"Masahiko Shimizu","affiliation":["YRP Research and Development Center, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Shimizu","id":"37336475400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073318","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Mean square error methods","Receiving antennas","Detectors","Antenna feeds","Fading","Diversity methods","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","fading channels","frequency selective surfaces","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time adaptive processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition number-based antenna shuffling scheme","D-STTD OFDM system","double space time transmit diversity","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel correlation matrix","minimum mean square error criterion","frequency selective MIMO fading channels"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study low complexity double space time transmit diversity (D-STTD) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with antenna shuffling. We propose a novel antenna shuffling method based on the criterion of minimizing the condition number of channel correlation matrix. The condition number is an indicator about the quality of the channel. By selecting the minimum of condition number which has better channel quality, consequently, a linear detector with respect to this new channel may achieve better performance results. A low complexity variant of the condition number calculation is also proposed, and it is shown that this criterion can be reduced to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion.

Using a novel technique for polynomial matrix QR decomposition (PMQRD) based on Givens rotations, we extend this work to frequency selective MIMO systems. A transmitter design based on Diagonal Bell Laboratories Layered Space Time (D-BLAST) encoding has been implemented. Turbo equalization is utilized at the receiver to overcome the multipath delay spread and to facilitate multi-stream data feedback. The effect of channel estimation error on system performance has also been considered to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed PMQRD scheme. Average bit error rate simulations show a considerable improvement over a benchmark orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique. The proposed scheme thereby has potential applicability in MIMO communication applications, particularly for TDMA systems with frequency selective channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 -

In this paper we focus on the challenging QoS-aware optimal power allocation problem, aiming to maximize the system sum rate and guarantee the users' minimum data rates. As a result, a \"Polynomial Approximations based on Single Condensation\" (PASC) strategy is proposed which transforms the underlying problem to a series of tractable Geometric Programming (GP) problems through single condensation scheme.

This paper proposes a routing protocol, called MRPT (MAC-based Routing Protocol for TRITON), that piggybacks routing information on WiMAX mesh MAC control messages. This provides proactiveness and readily available multi-path for traffic from ship to land station. For traffic from land station to ship, the proposed routing protocol uses a bitmap encoding to efficiently inform land station of the constructed routing tree.

CCI cancellation algorithms for the 2G GSM and the 3G CDMA systems have been under intense research. However, since orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been adopted in the next generation mobile communication systems, dealing with CCI is more complex in OFDM than in GSM or CDMA because it requires dynamic power control and frequency allocation with advanced coordination among base stations. In this paper, we propose a single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) algorithm named power adaptive joint maximum a posterior (PA-JMAP) for OFDM systems. The proposed PA-JMAP algorithm jointly decodes the desired and interfering data by using a joint trellis, which defines all possible combinations of each base station's encoder trellis. Signal to interference ratio (SIR) estimated by a sequentially updated estimator is used to track power changes of the received signal. Simulation results show that the proposed PA-JMAP decoder could greatly improve the BER performance for OFDM systems even under severe CCI conditions when compared to a conventional viterbi decoder (CVD).","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073344.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Single Antenna Interference Cancellation Algorithm for OFDM Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","OFDM","Radiofrequency interference","Bit error rate","Decoding","GSM","Multiaccess communication","Interchannel interference","Degradation","3G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","error statistics","frequency allocation","maximum likelihood estimation","mobile communication","OFDM modulation","power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single antenna interference cancellation algorithm","OFDM communication systems","co-channel interference","bit error rate","next generation mobile communication systems","dynamic power control","frequency allocation","power adaptive joint maximum a posterior"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Single Antenna Interference Cancellation Algorithm for OFDM Communication Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073344/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718375","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Single Antenna Interference Cancellation Algorithm for OFDM Communication Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-22-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057826S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073346,"authors":[{"name":"Junyi Wang","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Junyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406465900"},{"name":"Tuncer Baykas","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tuncer","lastName":"Baykas","id":"37298247900"},{"name":"Ryuhei Funada","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuhei","lastName":"Funada","id":"37297585200"},{"name":"Chin-Sean Sum","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Chin-Sean","lastName":"Sum","id":"37406865200"},{"name":"Azizur Rahman","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Azizur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37274001000"},{"name":"Zhou Lan","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Lan","id":"37409324600"},{"name":"Hiroshi Harada","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Harada","id":"37276707400"},{"name":"Shuzo Kato","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuzo","lastName":"Kato","id":"37404810100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073346","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A SNR Mapping Scheme for ZF/MMSE Based SC-FDE Structured WPANs","abstract":"The paper presents a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) mapping scheme for single-carrier (SC) frequency domain equalization (FDE) based millimeter-wave wireless personal area networks (WPANs). The effective SNR, defined as an average SNR over whole data frame after equalization, is a one-to-one mapper of the SNR in practical scenario in the sense of the same bit error rate (BER) performance. As the mapping is based on theoretical calculation instead of the simulation on a specific channel model, the defined effective SNR is suitable to be used as a metric, such as threshold for link adaptation, because it decides system BER performance just based on theoretical BER performance of AWGN channel instead of channel-model dependent SNR-BER table. The close form of effective SNR is proposed. A link adaptation method based on the defined effective SNR is given to show how our defined effective SNR simplifies system design. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the defined effective SNR is channel-model independent and it is accuracy enough with variance of mapping error lower than 1 dB, it is therefore useful, especially for the system possibly involved in several different wireless communication scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073346","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073346.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Signal mapping","Frequency domain analysis","Millimeter wave communication","Millimeter wave technology","Wireless personal area networks","AWGN channels","System analysis and design","Analysis of variance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","equalisers","error statistics","personal area networks","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR mapping","ZF/MMSE","SC-FDE","WPAN","signal-to-noise ratio","single-carrier frequency domain equalization","millimeter-wave wireless personal area networks","bit error rate","channel model","BER","AWGN","link adaptation method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A SNR Mapping Scheme for ZF/MMSE Based SC-FDE Structured WPANs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073346/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073346/","accessionNumber":"10718377","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SNR Mapping Scheme for ZF/MMSE Based SC-FDE Structured WPANs","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-06-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083659S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073349,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

When assuming full knowledge of the channel state information at the transmitter, a vector perturbation (VP) is a promising precoding scheme that approaches sum capacity and has simple receiver. However, its encoding is nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard problem. In the MU-MIMO downlink, this encoding problem becomes harder because the proper user selection must be considered. In this paper, we propose a new vector perturbation scheme based on eigenvalue normalization (VPEVN), which converts the NP-hard problem into a channel condition-based finite integer problem, resulting in a reduction of encoding complexity. In addition, it can select a good user set by simple maximum norm criterion owing to its orthogonalization effect.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073352.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Vector Perturbation Technique Based on Eigenvalue Normalization for Multi-User MIMO Downlink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Perturbation methods","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO","Downlink","Transmitters","Throughput","Feedback","Channel state information","Broadcasting","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","encoding","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","perturbation techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector perturbation technique","eigenvalue normalization","multiuser MIMO downlink","nonlinear precoding techniques","multi user multiple input multiple output downlink","channel state information","nondeterministic polynomial time NP hard problem","encoding complexity reduction","orthogonalization effect"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Vector Perturbation Technique Based on Eigenvalue Normalization for Multi-User MIMO Downlink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073352/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718402","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Vector Perturbation Technique Based on Eigenvalue Normalization for Multi-User MIMO Downlink","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-11-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091118S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073355,"authors":[{"name":"Chunhui Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Chunhui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406604900"},{"name":"Georg Bocherer","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Bocherer","id":"37397844800"},{"name":"Rudolf Mathar","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Mathar","id":"37271899400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073355","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Resource management","Downlink","Performance loss","Computational modeling","Fading","Bit error rate","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Information technology","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDMA","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","subcarrier assignment","channel-to-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of resource allocation for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) downlink that aims at minimizing the total transmission power under data transmission constraints.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a proper and efficient modulation scheme for CR. Adaptive beamforming technique improves CR reliable communication by strengthening the desired signals and rejecting interferences. In this paper, two post IFFT/FFT OFDM adaptive beamformers with iterative weights computing are proposed. The first one directly heritages the spectrum masking concept and deactivates the weights for the OFDM CR subcarriers, which hold the same frequency bands with the Licensed Users (LU). Another beamformer adds extra constraints to those weights instead of masking them, directs the main beam towards the CR users and nulls towards the LU and interferences, and consequently shares the same spectrum bands with LU. Simulation results show that both two OFDM adaptive beamformers guarantee that the CR system not to disturb the LU. Furthermore, it is shown that beamforming with constrained weights provides a lower BER, higher bit rate, more efficient spectrum usage, and suffers no side lobe interference from the LU.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive OFDM Beamformer with Constrained Weights for Cognitive Radio","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073362","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073362.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive OFDM Beamformer with Constrained Weights for Cognitive Radio","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073362/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718412","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive OFDM Beamformer with Constrained Weights for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-01-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077602S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073363,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuel B.

Classical Radio Resource Allocation (RRA) strategies, such as Max-Rate (MR), Proportional Fairness (PF) and Max- Min Fairness (MMF), show different performances regarding the three aforementioned aspects. In this work, we present an adaptive RRA framework that joins the criteria of the three classical strategies in a unified manner and can be dynamically configured according to the cellular operator's objectives. We exemplify the flexible use of this general framework by proposing two adaptive RRA algorithms that provide strict fairness among users and maximizes the users' satisfaction, respectively.

To reduce the total feedback without significant performance loss, we assign a user to the diversity subchannel when the band-AMC mode has no gain over the diversity mode based on the frequency selectivity of the user. After user selection, we apply joint power and rate allocation to exploit the asymmetry in required transmit power of the band-AMC mode and the diversity mode. The results reveal that the mixed frame with simple user classification provides a performance comparable to the frame with band-AMC mode only at a much reduced feedback. In particular, it is observed that the mixed frame with frequency division is preferable to that with time division by increasing the throughput of the users at the cell boundary in a large cell.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073365","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073365.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Resource Allocation for OFDMA with Mixed Frame Structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073365/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Resource Allocation for OFDMA with Mixed Frame Structure","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718415","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073365/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Resource Allocation for OFDMA with Mixed Frame Structure","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-17-08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048001S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073367,"authors":[{"name":"Amr El-Keyi","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent Networks Center, Nile University, Giza, Egypt"],"firstName":"Amr","lastName":"El-Keyi","id":"38275224400"},{"name":"Benoit Champagne","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Champagne","id":"37296590000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073367","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","MIMO","Array signal processing","Relays","Iterative algorithms","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Filtering algorithms","Kalman filters","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","Kalman filters","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive training collaborative MIMO beamforming","multiuser relay networks","cooperative relaying","multiuser relay beamforming","beamforming matrix estimation","Kalman filtering"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a cooperative relaying scenario with multiple sources transmitting to one or more destination nodes through several relay terminals. Each relay is equipped with multiple receive and transmit antennas. We assume that the relays can estimate their uplink (relay-destination) channels with enough accuracy and that they have access to the training sequences transmitted by the sources. We present two adaptive training-based algorithms for multiuser relay beamforming. Both algorithms use Kalman filtering to estimate the beamforming matrices iteratively. The first algorithm is centralized where the relay terminals forward their received data to a processing center that computes the beamforming coefficients and feeds them back to the relays. In the second algorithm, each relay terminal can estimate its beamforming matrix locally using its received data and some common information that is broadcasted by the other relays. We present numerical simulations that validate the good performance of the proposed beamforming algorithms in stationary and nonstationary signal environments.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073367","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073367.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Training-Based Collaborative MIMO Beamforming for Multiuser Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Training-Based Collaborative MIMO Beamforming for Multiuser Relay Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073367/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718417","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073367/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Training-Based Collaborative MIMO Beamforming for Multiuser Relay Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-02-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078265S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073370,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive feedback method that can significantly reduce the amount of channel feedback information when a femto base station (BS) and mobile stations (MS) communicate in the band AMC mode. Since the channel variation of the MS in the femto cell is relatively small, instead of informing the femto BS of the channel quality information (CQI) periodically, MSs only send CQI feedback to the femto BS when channel condition changes above a threshold. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce feedback overhead up to 70% without resulting in system throughput degradation compared to the conventional best-M feedback scheme.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073375","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Feedback Method with Channel Change Indication for Band AMC in a Femto Cell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Feedback Method with Channel Change Indication for Band AMC in a Femto Cell","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073375/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718445","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073375/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Feedback Method with Channel Change Indication for Band AMC in a Femto Cell","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-18-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053567S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073376,"authors":[{"name":"Rym Ouertani","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Rym","lastName":"Ouertani","id":"37407916100"},{"name":"Ghaya Rekaya Ben-Othman","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Ghaya Rekaya","lastName":"Ben-Othman","id":"37399007000"},{"name":"Jean-Claude Belfiore","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Claude","lastName":"Belfiore","id":"37284731700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073376","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Decoding","Switches","Lattices","Quality of service","Telecommunications","Receiving antennas","Matrix decomposition","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive MIMO decoder","MIMO systems","sub-optimal decoders","ML decoding","variable decoding time","channel realizations"]}],"abstract":"In existing MIMO systems, either optimal or sub-optimal decoders can be used according to the required performance. However, the optimal decoders give ML performance but have very high complexity and the sub-optimal decoders give low complexity but poor performance. Moreover for ML decoding, the variable decoding time at a fixed SNR for the different channel realizations and also the big gap in the complexity between low and high SNRs represent a critical point for practical implementation. We propose here an adaptive decoder that allows to switch between optimal and sub-optimal decoders according to the channel realization and the system specifications. This decoder offers an almost constant complexity while keeping good performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive MIMO Decoder","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073376","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073376.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive MIMO Decoder","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073376/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718446","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive MIMO Decoder","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-12-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033258S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073378,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Rasouli","affiliation":["WiNCORE Laboratory, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Rasouli","id":"37397627800"},{"name":"Alagan Anpalagan","affiliation":["WiNCORE Laboratory, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Alagan","lastName":"Anpalagan","id":"37270506600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073378","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Throughput","Resource management","Fading","System performance","Greedy algorithms","Measurement","Laboratories","Frequency conversion","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","greedy algorithms","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","dynamic subcarrier allocation","multiuser diversity","sub-carrier allocation algorithm","asymptotic fairness","group allocation","user allocation","maxmin algorithm","greedy algorithm","nonreal-time applications"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic subcarrier allocation improves the performance of OFDM systems by exploiting multi-user diversity. Fairness index is a parameter which indicates how fairly the sub-carriers are allocated among the users in a system. A greedy sub-carrier allocation algorithm optimizes the system performance in terms of throughput, but it sacrifices the instantaneous fairness. In this paper, we define a new term called \"asymptotic fairness\". It is shown that for a small number of users greedy subcarrier allocation algorithm leads to a normalized fairness index close to unity after a few channel realizations; therefore, if the users of the same group can wait for a few OFDM symbols, they all can get almost the same data rate. To generalize the idea for larger number of users, we have proposed grouping of the users into smaller group sizes. The proposed subcarrier allocation algorithm allocates the subcarriers in two steps: group-allocation and user-allocation. Group-allocation is performed to maintain fairness among different groups by using a fairness-oriented subcarrier allocation algorithm such as max-min algorithm. In the user-allocation step, the subcarriers are allocated to the users within the group using the greedy algorithm to maximize the throughput. The proposed algorithm is specifically suitable for non-real-time applications. According to the required average fairness index in the system and the maximum allowable waiting time, it is possible to find the proper group size in the proposed two-step subcarrier allocation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Asymptotically Fair Subcarrier Allocation Algorithm in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073378","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073378.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Asymptotically Fair Subcarrier Allocation Algorithm in OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073378/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718448","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Asymptotically Fair Subcarrier Allocation Algorithm in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-08-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03301S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5073379,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37935043100"},{"name":"Qing Huang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37599106400"},{"name":"Zaichen Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zaichen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37440503100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073379","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Timing","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Computational complexity","Digital video broadcasting","Robustness","Information science","Mobile communication","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","multiplexing","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint timing","frequency offset estimation","OFDM systems","joint frame synchronization","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","PN sequence","timing estimator","time offset estimation","timing error rate","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new joint frame synchronization and frequency offset estimation algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems as a modification to Zhang's method (Zhang et al., 2005).

Also two alternatives (averaging in the time or frequency domains) are explored in order to provide the transmitter with the information needed to implement the transmission strategy when it is only possible to get information about the channel statistics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073390.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Beamforming and Spatial Multiplexing Strategies in WMAN Outdoor-Indoor Scenarios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073390/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Beamforming and Spatial Multiplexing Strategies in WMAN Outdoor-Indoor Scenarios","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10703978","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Beamforming and Spatial Multiplexing Strategies in WMAN Outdoor-Indoor Scenarios","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-12-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079487S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073391,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The studied methods are based on clipping with windowing, and they were originally devised for OFDM transmitters. The performance comparisons are done by evaluating bit error rate and spectral regrowth behavior. The study also investigates the near-far effect for adjacent signals considering both the synchronized and unsynchronized cases. The results show that the methods designed for OFDM can be fully applied to FBMC with similar performance in the synchronized case. Further, the well-known advantage of high spectral selectivity of FBMC in unsynchronized scenarios is also clearly visible when applying the studied techniques.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073391","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073391.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Clipping-Based PAPR-Reduction in Multicarrier Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Clipping-Based PAPR-Reduction in Multicarrier Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073391/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10756513","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073391/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Clipping-Based PAPR-Reduction in Multicarrier Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-23-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036787S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5073392,"authors":[{"name":"Mairtin O'Droma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Mairtin","lastName":"O'Droma","id":"37295907800"},{"name":"Yiming Lei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Lei","id":"37403158400"},{"name":"Eduard Bertran","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Bertran","id":"37268060400"},{"name":"Pere Gilabert","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Pere","lastName":"Gilabert","id":"37266501800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073392","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems are significantly sensitive to the nonlinear distortion caused by RF power amplifiers.

The paper analyzes the influence of the transmitter phase noise to the OFDM system in the multi-path fading channel, and shows when the transmitter contains large phase noise, the immunity of OFDM system to multipath fading is destroyed and the frequency domain model of the influence of phase noise used by some algorithms is no longer suitable. Then a feedback method to reduce the transmitter phase noise is proposed. Simulation results show that after pre- correction of transmitter phase noise, the existing algorithms that have been proposed in the receiver end can be performed to mitigate the receiver phase noise more effectively in the scenario when PHN generated at the transmitter is large compared to PHN generated at the receiver end.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073397.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Transmitter Phase Noise in OFDM System and its Mitigation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Phase noise","OFDM","Fading","Interference","Oscillators","Laboratories","Frequency domain analysis","Feedback","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","transmitter phase noise analysis","spectral broadening","high order signal constellations","multipath fading channel","frequency domain model","feedback method","PHN generation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Transmitter Phase Noise in OFDM System and its Mitigation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073397/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10703984","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Transmitter Phase Noise in OFDM System and its Mitigation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-21-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06512S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073401,"authors":[{"name":"Huimin She","affiliation":["ASIC & System State Key Laboratory, Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Huimin","lastName":"She","id":"37702197900"},{"name":"Zhonghai Lu","affiliation":["IPack Vinn Excellence Center, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhonghai","lastName":"Lu","id":"37308609800"},{"name":"Axel Jantsch","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, KTH, Sweden"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Jantsch","id":"37282456900"},{"name":"Dian Zhou","affiliation":["ASIC & System State Key Laboratory, Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dian","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37277316800"},{"name":"Li-Rong Zheng","affiliation":["IPack Vinn Excellence Center, Sweden"],"firstName":"Li-Rong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37276915800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073401","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Traffic control","Delay","Telecommunication traffic","Calculus","Microelectronics","Telecommunication network reliability","Energy efficiency","Analytical models","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication traffic","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","transmission reliability","traffic model","service model","energy model","hop-by- hop retransmission","end-to-end retransmission","maximum packet transfer delay","low bit-error- rate"]}],"abstract":"Retransmission has been adopted as one of the most popular schemes for improving transmission reliability in wireless sensor networks. Many previous works have been done on reliable transmission issues in experimental ways, however, there still lack of analytical techniques to evaluate these solutions. Based on the traffic model, service model and energy model, we propose an analytical method to analyze the delay and energy metrics of two categories of retransmission schemes: hop-by- hop retransmission (HBH) and end-to-end retransmission (ETE). With the experiment results, the maximum packet transfer delay and energy efficiency of these two scheme are compared in several scenarios. Moreover, the analytical results of transfer delay are validated through simulations. Our experiments demonstrate that HBH has less energy consumption at the cost of larger transfer delay compared with ETE. With the same target success probability, ETE is superior on the delay metric for low bit-error- rate (BER) cases, while HBH is superior for high BER cases.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073401","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073401.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Evaluation of Retransmission Schemes in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Evaluation of Retransmission Schemes in Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073401/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10703988","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073401/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Evaluation of Retransmission Schemes in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01-02-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067976S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073402,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Agustin","affiliation":["Department Signal Theory and Communications, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Agustin","id":"37266551600"},{"name":"Josep Vidal","affiliation":["Department Signal Theory and Communications, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Vidal","id":"37273645500"},{"name":"Olga Munoz","affiliation":["Department Signal Theory and Communications, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Munoz","id":"37266548300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073402","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Automatic repeat request","Protocols","Channel state information","Transmitters","Delay","Decoding","Feedback","Automatic control","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","channel coding","decoding","diversity reception","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytical resource optimization","DF relay-assisted transmission","chase-combining HARQ protocols","channel state information","automatic repeat request","delay-tolerant services","decode-and-forward relay","ACK feedback channels","retransmission procedure","resources allocation","half-duplex transmission","wireless channels","diversity gain"]}],"abstract":"Under limited channel state information at the transmitter the communication suffers from the outage events produced by a data rate selection not supported by the current channel realization. Automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols are a useful tool to deal with those outage events in delay-tolerant services. This work looks into how automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols are applied to the half-duplex relay-assisted transmission with a decode-and-forward (DF) relay. The exploitation of ACK feedback channels from destination and relay leads to two possible implementations: 1) only-source manages the retransmission procedure or 2) both source and relay control the retransmissions.

Finally, the asymptotic capacity loss of Rician channels relative to Rayleigh channels is derived.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073406","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073406.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rician channels","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Rayleigh channels","Transmitting antennas","Channel capacity","Signal analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Closed-form solution","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel capacity","correlation methods","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rician fading MIMO channel capacity","multiple-input multiple-output system","approximation theory","correlated Rayleigh channel","rank-1 mean matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Approximation to the Capacity of Rician Fading MIMO Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073406/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073406/","accessionNumber":"10703993","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation to the Capacity of Rician Fading MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-04-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043834S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5073407,"authors":[{"name":"Sarmad Sohaib","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Sarmad","lastName":"Sohaib","id":"37403542000"},{"name":"Daniel K.

This alleviates the detrimental effects of fading and offers reliable data transfer. In this paper, we present a novel asynchronous cooperative multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication scheme in the presence of polarization diversity which does not require synchronization at the relay node. Utilizing dual-polarized antennas, the relay node achieves full duplex amplify-and-forward (ANF) communication. Hence the transmission duration is significantly reduced which in turn results into an increased throughput rate. Capacity analysis of the proposed system ascertains the high data rate as compared to the conventional ANF protocol. Bit error rate simulation also shows that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms both the non-cooperative single-input single-output and the conventional ANF schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Polarized Cooperative MIMO Communication","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073407","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073407.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Polarized Cooperative MIMO Communication","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073407/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10703994","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Polarized Cooperative MIMO Communication","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-04-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105138S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5073408,"authors":[{"name":"Wenling Bai","affiliation":["National key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wenling","lastName":"Bai","id":"37665217300"},{"name":"Lilin Dan","affiliation":["National key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lilin","lastName":"Dan","id":"37409626600"},{"name":"Yue Xiao","affiliation":["National key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37556980400"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073408","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attenuation","Signal analysis","OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Nonlinear distortion","Filtering","Transmitters","Frequency domain analysis","System performance","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal attenuation factor analysis","OFDM signals","peak cancellation","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems"]}],"abstract":"Peak-cancellation is a pre-distortion technique for peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

However, to realize CR concept, it is essential to provide enough incentives to PRN and extra profit to the service provider so that cognitive radio mobile stations (CR-MSs) may utilize PRN spectrum accordingly, which provides a new challenge for spectrum management. In this paper, we consider a PRN consisting of a primary system base station (PS-BS) and multiple primary system mobile stations (PS-MSs), and we therefore construct a cognitive radio network (CRN) consisting of a PRN with multiple CR-MSs. We propose a spectrum management policy framework such that CR-MSs can compete in utilization of the PRN spectrum bands available to opportunistic transmission of CR-MSs by Vickrey auction. PRN is granted incentives for being compensated for possible operating interference from CR-MSs in this scenario. Once CR-MSs are awarded the spectrum bands, they can be guaranteed a superframe time to utilize the spectrum band without any spectrum handoff. Consequently, in addition to incentives to the PRN, the overall spectrum utilization, the profit of the service provider, the spectrum access opportunity of the CR-MSs are increased to achieve co- win situation for every party in cognitive radio networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073409/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10704016","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073409/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Auction Based Spectrum Management of Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auction Based Spectrum Management of Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-03-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044146S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073410,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Kong","affiliation":["Department of EEE, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Kong","id":"37672803300"},{"name":"Yu-Kwong Kwok","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Yu-Kwong","lastName":"Kwok","id":"37268292400"},{"name":"Jiangzhou Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, UK"],"firstName":"Jiangzhou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280544800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073410","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Resource management","Scheduling algorithm","Wireless networks","Time division multiple access","Throughput","Cost accounting","Bandwidth","Wireless LAN","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auction based scheduling","non cooperative","multiuser OFDM systems","resource allocation","proportional fairness"]}],"abstract":"We study the problem of achieving proportional fair resource allocation in a non-cooperative multiuser OFDM network.

Through simulations, we find that users lying about their resource requirements are severely penalized by very high payments so that they should rather declare true valuations of subcarriers to the scheduler. Thus, the proposed auction-based scheduling algorithm can be used efficiently in a non-cooperative situation to realize proportional fairness.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073410","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auction-Based Scheduling in Non-Cooperative Multiuser OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Auction-Based Scheduling in Non-Cooperative Multiuser OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073410/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704017","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073410/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auction-Based Scheduling in Non-Cooperative Multiuser OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-08-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061261S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073414,"authors":[{"name":"Woo Jin Shin","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo Jin","lastName":"Shin","id":"37402402700"},{"name":"Kyoung Youp Park","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyoung Youp","lastName":"Park","id":"37935576500"},{"name":"Dong In Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong In","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279315300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073414","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admission control","Cognitive radio","Resource management","Constraint optimization","Frequency conversion","Quality of service","Interference constraints","Throughput","Large-scale systems","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","quality of service","signal detection","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["average sense joint rate algorithm","power allocation algorithm","admission control","cognitive radio networks","dynamic spectrum sharing","average sense resource allocation","power adaptation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","quality of service"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073414","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073414","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate a dynamic spectrum sharing problem for centralized uplink cognitive radio networks using orthogonal frequency division multiple access.

To implement the resource allocation in average sense, we introduce a concept of using the conservative factors and depending on the outage and violation probabilities. Since estimating instantaneous channel gains is costly and requires high complexity, the proposed algorithm pursues a practical and implementation-friendly resource allocation.

We use particle filtering methods to track the location of a PU in the network using cooperative localization techniques and present some results for noisy measurements. The cognitive radio (CR) nodes estimate the information related to the geographical position of the PU based on existing location identification and localization techniques and forward the noisy information to a cognitive radio base station (CRB), which then fuses the information to estimate the position of the PU in the network in order to perform a radio scene analysis. We propose a particle filtering approach that is suitable for tracking Gaussian and non-Gaussian noisy signals at the CRB to estimate the position of a PU, two importance-functions relative to the particle filtering algorithm are also presented. Simulations are performed on the proposed tracking algorithm and the results are presented in terms of the mean squared error of the positional estimates.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073417","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073417.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073417","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Tracking in Cooperative Localization for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Tracking in Cooperative Localization for Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073417/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073417/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704024","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Tracking in Cooperative Localization for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-07-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070667S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073418,"authors":[{"name":"Woon Hau Chin","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, UK"],"firstName":"Woon Hau","lastName":"Chin","id":"37331357200"},{"name":"Chin Keong Ho","affiliation":["Modulation and Coding Department, Institute of Infocomm Research-Agency for Science, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chin Keong","lastName":"Ho","id":"37276277800"},{"name":"See Ho Ting","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"See Ho","lastName":"Ting","id":"37270082500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073418","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073418","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference cancellation","Relays","Bandwidth","Costs","Decoding","Additive white noise","Europe","Modulation coding","Optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","interference suppression","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference cancellation","half duplex relay stations","base-stations","cellular systems","mobile terminals","inter-relay interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073418","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073418.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming and Interference Cancellation for Half Duplex Relaying","abstract":"Using relays to extend the coverage of base-stations in cellular systems has been of interest in recent years as it can reduce the cost of installing more base-stations and yet cater to mobile terminals within a wider coverage area.

However, this AMI loss can be neglected for signal constellations with Gray mapping at high coding rates. AMI of amplitude-phase shift keying (APSK) constrained additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is provided in this paper, which shows that the BICM scheme has considerable loss with APSK constellations since no Gray mapping exists. Bit-interleaved low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded modulation (BILCM) is an excellent scheme and has been employed in many broadcasting and communication systems, however, such scheme also suffers from the independent demapping loss. Therefore, BILCM with iterative demapping and decoding (BILCM-ID) is proposed in this paper to overcome such loss. Simulation results show that the BILCM-ID scheme outweighs BILCM scheme by about 0.5 and 0.3 dB over AWGN channel for 32-APSK constellation at coding rates 2/3 and 4/5, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073425","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073425.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Interleaved LDPC-Coded Modulation with Iterative Demapping and Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bit-Interleaved LDPC-Coded Modulation with Iterative Demapping and Decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073425/","publicationDate":"April 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10704032","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073425/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Interleaved LDPC-Coded Modulation with Iterative Demapping and Decoding","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-23-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135053S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073428,"authors":[{"name":"Xingliang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Xingliang","lastName":"Li","id":"37935314700"},{"name":"Jean-Francois Frigon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Francois","lastName":"Frigon","id":"37299059100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073428","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system with dynamic radiation pattern diversity provided by composite right/left-handed (CRLH) leaky-wave antennas (LWA's). The CRLH-LWA is electronically reconfigurable with real time continuously direction-steerable radiation pattern and adjustable beamwidth. Analysis shows that these features match the clustered nature of indoor channels, and thus can provide high capacity gain by increasing received power. Furthermore, in MIMO systems the fully steerable direction provided by the CRLH-LWA is able to decorrelate the MIMO channel and improve the channel capacity. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that this is a highly promising approach for future high throughput reliable MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073428.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Analysis of MIMO Systems with Dynamic Radiation Pattern Diversity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern analysis","MIMO","Antenna radiation patterns","Channel capacity","Antennas and propagation","Azimuth","Leaky wave antennas","Decorrelation","Throughput","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","beam steering","channel capacity","diversity reception","indoor radio","leaky wave antennas","MIMO communication","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliable MIMO wireless system","dynamic radiation pattern diversity","multiple-input multiple-output system","right-handed antenna","left-handed antenna","composite leaky-wave antenna","electronically reconfigurable antenna","CRLH-LWA","real-time continuous direction-steerable radiation","indoor channel capacity gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Analysis of MIMO Systems with Dynamic Radiation Pattern Diversity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073428/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704055","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Analysis of MIMO Systems with Dynamic Radiation Pattern Diversity","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-04-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052869S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5073429,"authors":[{"name":"Chiara Buratti","affiliation":["WiLAB, DEIS, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Buratti","id":"37423420400"},{"name":"Alberto Zanella","affiliation":["WiLAB, DEIS, National Research Council, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Zanella","id":"37269061800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073429","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Relays","Receiving antennas","Decoding","Fluctuations","Capacity planning","Ad hoc networks","Resource management","Wireless sensor networks","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","fading channels","MIMO communication","probability","protocols","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-hop virtual MIMO system","multiple input multiple output system","Poisson field","fading channel","probability","channel capacity","two-hop communication protocol"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we investigate the performance of two-hop virtual multiple-input-multiple-output systems with random location of nodes.

Using a Bayesian approach, we construct a model in which we estimate jointly the coefficients of the channel taps, the channel order and decay rate of the PDP. In order to sample from the resulting posterior distribution we develop a novel Trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TDMCMC) algorithm. This is done using a Stochastic Approximation (SA) approach to develop an adaptively learning algorithm to improve mixing rates of the basic Birth-Death (B-D) Markov chain for the between model subspaces. Using simulations we assess its performance in terms of channel order estimation and bit error rate (BER). It is shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve results very close to the case where both the channel length and the PDP are known.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073436","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073436.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems with Unknown Power Delay Profile using Trans-Dimensional MCMC via Stochastic Approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073436/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems with Unknown Power Delay Profile using Trans-Dimensional MCMC via Stochastic Approximation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704063","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073436/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems with Unknown Power Delay Profile using Trans-Dimensional MCMC via Stochastic Approximation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-15-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067299S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073437,"authors":[{"name":"Darlene Neves","affiliation":["Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Leiria, Leiria, Portugal"],"firstName":"Darlene","lastName":"Neves","id":"37938322000"},{"name":"Carlos Ribeiro","affiliation":["Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Leiria, Leiria, Portugal"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Ribeiro","id":"37648684200"},{"name":"Adao Silva","affiliation":["Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Leiria, Leiria, Portugal"],"firstName":"Adao","lastName":"Silva","id":"37401627600"},{"name":"Atilio Gameiro","affiliation":["Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Leiria, Leiria, Portugal"],"firstName":"Atilio","lastName":"Gameiro","id":"37270506000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073437","dbTime":"49 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Relays","Protocols","Least squares approximation","Mean square error methods","Cooperative systems","Wireless communication","Block codes","Power system relaying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","protocols","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM relay-assisted systems","pilot-aided channel estimation schemes","least square","minimum mean square error","amplify-and-forward relay protocol","cooperative systems","single antenna","base station","user terminal","relay node","conventional wireless communications"]}],"abstract":"The aim of this paper is to adapt and evaluate the performance of two classical pilot-aided channel estimation schemes designed for OFDM systems: least square and minimum mean square error, in a relay-assisted scenario.

In an inter-vehicle communication system, a channel-tracking scheme is essential to achieve reliable wireless communication under the fast fading environment caused by surrounding vehicles. For coherent detection, decision feedback is a well-known channel-tracking scheme. In this scheme, replica signals are generated and channel estimation is performed by using the replica signals. However, because channel estimation performance depends on the signal-to-noise (SNR) at symbol time, decision feedback errors occur by the lower SNR caused by fast fading. The feedback errors degrade the transmission performance significantly. In an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, the time domain 0-padding scheme is a well-known channel estimation technique. Although better channel tracking performance is expected by applying the 0-padding scheme, the tracking performance is degraded when employing guard-bands in the OFDM system. In this paper, we propose an improved time domain 0-padding scheme for an STBC-OFDM system employing guard-bands based on the IEEE802.11p standard for inter-vehicle communication, and show the improved performance through computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073438.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Tracking with Zero Padding Scheme for STBC-OFDM System under Fast Fading Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Feedback","Channel estimation","OFDM","Degradation","Safety","Collision avoidance","Wireless communication","Vehicles","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","channel estimation","driver information systems","fading channels","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","time-domain analysis","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel tracking scheme","time domain zero padding scheme","STBC-OFDM system","fast fading channel","inter-vehicle communication system","wireless communication","decision feedback","channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","IEEE802.11p standard","space-time block code","driving safety support system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel Tracking with Zero Padding Scheme for STBC-OFDM System under Fast Fading Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073438/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704065","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Tracking with Zero Padding Scheme for STBC-OFDM System under Fast Fading Environment","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"08-04-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049358S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073442,"authors":[{"name":"Desire Guel","affiliation":["SUPELEC/IETR, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Desire","lastName":"Guel","id":"37569865600"},{"name":"Jacques Palicot","affiliation":["SUPELEC/IETR, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Palicot","id":"37269478700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073442","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"abstract":"Due to the simplest way for PAPR reduction, clipping technique have been proposed and seem to be promising for use in commercial systems. In this paper, the conventional clipping technique is formulated as an adding signal technique for PAPR reduction. We show that, when clipping occurs very rarely, the adding signal for PAPR reduction commonly called ldquopeak-reducing signalrdquo or ldquopeak-cancelling signalrdquo is approximately the distortion term resulting in the nonlinear processing of the OFDM envelope. This result may be extended to all forms of clipping. Later in this paper, the performance of clipping is characterized by deriving an asymptotic PAPR distribution of the clipped signal and by proposing a simple closed form of its signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) metric. These theoretical results corresponds to a special case of geometric method which is an adding signal technique for PAPR reduction.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073442.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clipping Formulated As an Adding Signal Technique for OFDM Peak Power Reduction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Nonlinear distortion","Signal processing","Signal generators","OFDM modulation","Wireless LAN","Digital audio broadcasting","Digital video broadcasting","Time domain analysis","Digital modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM peak power reduction","asymptotic PAPR distribution","signal clipping technique","nonlinear processing","signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio","SNDR metrics","geometric method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Clipping Formulated As an Adding Signal Technique for OFDM Peak Power Reduction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073442/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704069","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clipping Formulated As an Adding Signal Technique for OFDM Peak Power Reduction","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-21-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04808S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073443,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Min Shin","affiliation":["The Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Min","lastName":"Shin","id":"37533901200"},{"name":"Hyo-Jin Lee","affiliation":["The Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyo-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336509900"},{"name":"Kyeongcheol Yang","affiliation":["The Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyeongcheol","lastName":"Yang","id":"37334970200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073443","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Closed-form solution","Receiving antennas","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Detection algorithms","Interference cancellation","Antennas and propagation","Pulse modulation","Silicon carbide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","interference (signal)","Monte Carlo methods","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed form expressions","V-BLAST performance","quadrature amplitude modulation","symbol error rate","vertical Bell laboratories layered space-time","zero forcing successive interference cancellation","Rayleigh flat fading channel","error propagation","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we derive the symbol error rate (SER) of the vertical Bell laboratories layered space-time (V-BLAST) detection algorithm based on zero-forcing successive interference cancellation (ZF-SIC) over an independent and identically distributed Rayleigh flat fading channel.

However, the implementation cost and circuit complexity of such systems conflicts the guaranteed high performance gain. Recent research efforts focus on the investigation of cheaper and low complexity transceivers, introducing a novel beamspace MIMO (BS-MIMO) architecture. BS-MIMO systems have shown equivalent performance with the corresponding conventional systems, while they have been also evaluated in closed loop environments. In this paper we extend the closed loop BS MIMO approach presenting advanced limited feedback techniques which outperform predecessor feedback schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073444.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-Loop Beamspace MIMO Systems with Low Hardware Complexity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Hardware","Transmitting antennas","Antenna feeds","Costs","Feedback loop","Antenna arrays","Performance gain","Antenna radiation patterns","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","feedback","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop beamspace MIMO systems","hardware complexity","multiple-input multiple-output systems","wireless communication systems","single antenna architectures","circuit complexity","low-complexity transceivers","advanced limited feedback techniques","predecessor feedback schemes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Loop Beamspace MIMO Systems with Low Hardware Complexity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073444/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704071","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Loop Beamspace MIMO Systems with Low Hardware Complexity","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-12-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062926S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073445,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Schneider","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Illmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schneider","id":"37323248800"},{"name":"Martin Bauer","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Illmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Bauer","id":"38194293900"},{"name":"Milan Narandzic","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Illmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Narandzic","id":"38188635900"},{"name":"W.

Such networks perform co-operative spectrum sensing to find white spaces and apply policies to determine when and in which bands they may communicate. In a typical MAC protocol designed for cooperatively communicating ad hoc cognitive radio networks, nodes make use of a common control channel to perform channel negotiations before any actual data transmission. The provision of common control channel security is vital to ensure any subsequent security among the communicating cognitive radio nodes. To date, wireless security has received little attention in cognitive radio networks research. The cognitive radio paradigm introduces entirely new classes of security threats and challenges, such as selfish misbehaviours, licensed user emulation and eavesdropping. This paper presents a novel framework for providing common control channel security for co-operatively communicating cognitive radio nodes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper which proposes such a concept. The paper investigates how two cognitive radio nodes can authenticate each other prior to any confidential channel negotiations to ensure subsequent security against attacks. The paper also describes the importance of common control channel security and concludes with future work describing the realization of the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073450","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073450.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073450","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common Control Channel Security Framework for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Common Control Channel Security Framework for Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073450/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073450/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704095","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common Control Channel Security Framework for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-03-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05644S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073453,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Modir Shanechi","affiliation":["Department EECS, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Maryam Modir","lastName":"Shanechi","id":"37533842300"},{"name":"Ron Porat","affiliation":["NextWave Wireless, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Porat","id":"37411874700"},{"name":"Uri Erez","affiliation":["Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Uri","lastName":"Erez","id":"37284119700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073453","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Base stations","Channel state information","Throughput","Bandwidth","State feedback","Digital-analog conversion","Quantization","Computational complexity","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","feedback","MIMO communication","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["practical feedback algorithms","multiuser MIMO system","channel state information","channel feedback schemes","Shannon source-channel separation theorem","nonseparation based schemes","hybrid digital-analog transmission scheme","computational complexity","multiple-input multiple-output system"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of channel state information (CSI) transmission on a fast feedback link for a multiuser MIMO system.We examine the relative merits of channel feedback schemes based on Shannon's source-channel separation theorem and non-separation based schemes and show that the latter are preferable in this application.

However, an appreciable availability of the link is always a concern. Free Space Optics (FSO) links are highly weather dependent and fog is the major attenuating factor reducing the link availability.

This is because transmit power is limited by a battery in a terminal and we need higher transmit power to accommodate a wider frequency bandwidth in a higher frequency band. Virtual MIMO-based cooperative communication is expected to be a key technology to solve this problem. Especially, if we have a feedback path from the base station to send the transmit parameters, we can achieve much better performance. However, each terminal has an independent oscillator, and we have inevitably carrier frequency offsets. This causes performance degradation. This paper proposes a transmission scheme compensating for the frequency offsets and multi-stream transmission using eigenbeam space division multiplexing (E-SDM). Furthermore, this paper describes the reduction of feedback amount from a base station. From computer simulation results, it will be shown that the proposed transmission technique has excellent performance.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073463","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073463.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Communication Using a Virtual MIMO System with a Feedback Channel for Uplink Transmission in Cellular Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Communication Using a Virtual MIMO System with a Feedback Channel for Uplink Transmission in Cellular Radio","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073463/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704108","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073463/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Communication Using a Virtual MIMO System with a Feedback Channel for Uplink Transmission in Cellular Radio","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-12-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065425S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073465,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshitaka Hara","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshitaka","lastName":"Hara","id":"37273280500"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Yano","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Yano","id":"37343207800"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kubo","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kubo","id":"37365160000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073465","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Antenna arrays","Calibration","Antenna measurements","Transmitting antennas","Array signal processing","Downlink","Gain measurement","Base stations","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","antenna arrays","cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","telecommunication control","time division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive cooperative control","antenna array calibration","OFDMA-TDD systems","cooperative calibration mode","bidirectional channel measurement","cell terminal","control signalling"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes cooperative control for antenna array calibration to exploit channel reciprocity in OFDMA/TDD systems.

In this context, collaborative methods have been proposed to improve spectrum sensing capabilities over wireless channels, by counteracting shadow-fading phenomena via distributed diversity. However, recent results have shown that the expected benefits of cooperation, which are obtained at the expenses of increased traffic overhead and the need for a control channel, may be significantly hampered when the signals sensed by the cooperative users experience correlated shadow- fading. Moreover, it has been argued that spatial correlation of shadow-fading yields fundamental limits to the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing methods, and practical implications in terms of protocol design and network deployment. Motivated by the above considerations, in this paper we propose an analytical framework for the analysis and design of cooperative spectrum sensing methods over correlated shadow- fading environments, when each cooperative user is equipped with a simple energy-based detector. We will show that the framework requires efficient and accurate methods for modeling the power-sum of correlated Log-Normal Random Variables (RVs), which well describe shadowing phenomena. In particular, three main technical contributions can be found in the present paper: i) we generalize some recently proposed methods to approximate the power-sum of independent Log-Normal RVs to correlated scenarios, ii) we analyze the accuracy of several approximation techniques to compute detection probability over correlated Log-Normal shadowing, which is an unexplored field so far, and iii) we rely on the proposed framework to study the detrimental effect of correlation on the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing methods. Furthermore, numerical results will be shown to validate the proposed framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10704135","htmlLink":"/document/5073470/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks over Correlated Log-Normal Shadowing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks over Correlated Log-Normal Shadowing","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-04-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071081S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073471,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Guo","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory (WSPN), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Guo","id":"37628536600"},{"name":"Tao Peng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory (WSPN), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Peng","id":"37288452400"},{"name":"Shaoyi Xu","affiliation":["Nokia (China) Investment Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaoyi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37395024500"},{"name":"Haiming Wang","affiliation":["Nokia (China) Investment Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haiming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292552300"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory (WSPN), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073471","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":832},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Collaboration","Delay","Telecommunication network reliability","Wireless sensor networks","Signal processing","Wireless communication","Investments","Testing","Centralized control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","cluster-based architecture","cognitive radio networks","control channel bandwidth","communication overhead","sensing reliability","clustering strategy"]}],"abstract":"In cognitive radio networks, the limitation of control channel bandwidth is a challenge of cooperative spectrum sensing when the number of cognitive users becomes very large. Cluster- based architecture is applied for cooperative sensing to avoid the congestion on control channel and reduce the sensing delay. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme to improve the efficiency of the network. The number of clusters effects both the system efficiency and detection performance significantly. By balancing the tradeoff between the communication overhead and sensing reliability, we can obtain the optimal number of clusters, which can minimize the cooperation overhead without any performance loss of reliability. Moreover, a clustering strategy is proposed based on a given number of clusters and simulation results show the superiority of the proposed strategy.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073471","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073471.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073471","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Cluster-Based Architecture in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Cluster-Based Architecture in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073471/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073471/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704136","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Cluster-Based Architecture in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-04-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07616S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073473,"authors":[{"name":"Kyong-Hoe Kim","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyong-Hoe","lastName":"Kim","id":"37634599600"},{"name":"Jong-Ho Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jong-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37065070400"},{"name":"Chang-Hoon Lee","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chang-Hoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37599678300"},{"name":"Nam-Ryul Jeon","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Nam-Ryul","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37543496200"},{"name":"Seong-Cheol Kim","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Cheol","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291921400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073473","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Broadcasting","Radiofrequency interference","Signal processing algorithms","Interchannel interference","Receiving antennas","Downlink","Iterative algorithms","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","cellular radio","cochannel interference","MIMO communication","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated beamforming algorithm","base station cooperation","multicell multiuser MIMO broadcast channel","multi input multi output system","intercell co-channel interference","mobile communication"]}],"abstract":"The capacity of downlink multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is significantly limited by inter-cell co-channel interference (CCI).

To support this higher capacity a denser deployment might be necessary. An alternative way is to deploy Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) base stations (BSs), called advanced BSs, so that the system capacity is improved without increasing the BSs density. This paper compares Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) BS deployments with MIMO BS deployments from a cost perspective. We use a deployment methodology starting with a sparse density of BSs. By deploying additional BSs sequentially the number of BSs is increased until the traffic demand in the network area is supported. Providing equal service level, i.e., supporting the same traffic demand, by means of different deployment realizations enables a relevant comparison between the alternative single and multiple antenna systems. With the models and assumptions used here, results show that in order to support the same users' service level, the cost of deploying MIMO BSs is significantly less compared to increasing the density of SISO BSs. The cost gain is due to the reducing of the number of required BSs for the case of MIMO deployment.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073474","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073474.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost Comparison between SISO and MIMO Deployments in Future Wide Area Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073474/","displayDocTitle":"Cost Comparison between SISO and MIMO Deployments in Future Wide Area Cellular Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704139","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073474/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost Comparison between SISO and MIMO Deployments in Future Wide Area Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-12-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066023S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5073478,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Musavian","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Musavian","id":"37284625400"},{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073478","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":443},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Relays","Quality of service","Performance gain","Interference constraints","Radio transmitters","Delay","Closed-form solution","Channel capacity","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","quality of service","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross layer analysis","cognitive radio relay networks","quality of service constraints","secondary users","spectrum sharing restrictions","maximum arrival-rate","Rayleigh block fading environment"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Analysis of Cognitive Radio Relay Networks under Quality of Service Constraints","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073478.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073478","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073478","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the performance gains of cognitive radio relay networks under delay quality of service (QoS) limitations at the secondary users, and spectrum-sharing restrictions imposed by the primary users of the channel.

Using this constraint, we find the maximum limit on the interference-power inflicted on the primary receiver that should not be exceeded by the transmission of the secondary users. In addition, we assume that the secondary transmitter benefits from an intermediate node, chosen from K terminals, to relay its signal to the destination. Considering that the transmission of the secondary user is subject to satisfying a statistical delay QoS constraint, we obtain the maximum arrival-rate supported by the secondary user's relaying link.

This is accomplished by giving the scheduling unit a control over the beams to be applied, thus favorable radio channel conditions can be temporarily generated for specific users such that the associated packets are delivered in time.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073483","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073483.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Technique in a Cellular MIMO-OFDM System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073483/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Technique in a Cellular MIMO-OFDM System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704148","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073483/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Technique in a Cellular MIMO-OFDM System","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-03-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054694S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073484,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoya Tandai","affiliation":["Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoya","lastName":"Tandai","id":"37410404100"},{"name":"Hiroki Mori","affiliation":["Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Mori","id":"37402909700"},{"name":"Masahiro Takagi","affiliation":["Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Takagi","id":"37693423900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073484","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":453},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Wireless LAN","Physical layer","Throughput","Channel state information","Channel capacity","Modulation coding","Optimization methods","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","modulation coding","multiuser channels","space division multiplexing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer optimization","user grouping strategy","downlink multiuser MIMO systems","user selection","packet transmission technique","multiple-input multiple-output system","IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN","modulation and coding scheme","spatial multiplexing","spatial channel correlation","packet waiting times","packet duration uniformity","local area networks"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a cross-layer-optimized user selection and packet transmission technique for the downlink multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN (WLAN). In IEEE 802.11 WLAN, packet duration is decided by a data size and a selected transmission mode (modulation and coding scheme, MCS), and therefore, in general, the packet duration of each user varies according to the channel conditions and the applications. If multiple users whose packet durations are considerably different are selected as the target of the downlink MU-MIMO transmission, then the efficiency of spatial multiplexing degrades and the network throughput cannot be enhanced. When selecting users as the target of the downlink MU-MIMO transmission, the degree of spatial channel correlation among users (from the viewpoint of the physical layer) and the packet waiting times in a queue (from the viewpoint of the MAC layer) have to be considered. In addition to these criteria, in IEEE 802.11 WLAN, uniformity of the packet durations among users has to be considered as a criterion. In the proposed method, data size is adjusted in order to make the packet durations of the users uniform after selecting the users based on the spatial compatibility and the packet waiting times. This means that the proposed downlink MU- MIMO transmission is optimized in 3 dimensions by the cross- layer approach: the spatial channel correlations, packet waiting times and the uniformity of the packet durations. Computer simulations are performed and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073484","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073484.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer-Optimized User Grouping Strategy in Downlink Multiuser MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer-Optimized User Grouping Strategy in Downlink Multiuser MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073484/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704149","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073484/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer-Optimized User Grouping Strategy in Downlink Multiuser MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-13-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055643S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5073485,"authors":[{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amitav","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37291343600"},{"name":"Hyuck M.

To achieve the objective of minimizing the bit error rate, this paper employs systematic IRA codes so that pilot symbols can be encoded as part of the data. In this way, initial channel estimation can be performed using the systematic encoded pilot symbols before channel decoding. In addition, the known pilot symbol positions have higher reliability than data and can significantly improve the initial decoding. The availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter via feedback from the receiver is also exploited by introducing a second pilot permutation that adapts to the receiver channel conditions, which is shown to outperform the conventional uniform pilot spacing within the OFDM symbol. Simulation results verify the improvement in performance compared to iterative OFDM receivers with either un-encoded or encoded uniformly-spaced pilot symbols without CSI feedback.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CSI-Adaptive Encoded Pilot-Symbols for Iterative OFDM Receiver with IRA Coding","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073485","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073485.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"CSI-Adaptive Encoded Pilot-Symbols for Iterative OFDM Receiver with IRA Coding","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073485/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704169","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSI-Adaptive Encoded Pilot-Symbols for Iterative OFDM Receiver with IRA Coding","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-08-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059087S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073490,"authors":[{"name":"Jialing Liu","affiliation":["Standards and Research Laboratory, Mobile Devices, Motorola, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Jialing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37675842700"},{"name":"Robert Love","affiliation":["Standards and Research Laboratory, Mobile Devices, Motorola, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Love","id":"37293840000"},{"name":"Kenneth Stewart","affiliation":["Standards and Research Laboratory, Mobile Devices, Motorola, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Stewart","id":"37287295100"},{"name":"Michael Eoin Buckley","affiliation":["Standards and Research Laboratory, Mobile Devices, Motorola, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Michael Eoin","lastName":"Buckley","id":"37941527900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073490","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1437},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Boosting","Analytical models","Standards development","Long Term Evolution","3G mobile communication","Radio access networks","Data communication","Delay","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","broadband networks","radio access networks","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE physical downlink control channel","UMTS terrestrial radio access network","4G wireless broadband technology","data transmission rate","downlink scheduling assignment","interference randomization property","power boosting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073490","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073490","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","abstract":"Long Term Evolution (LTE) of UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access and Radio Access Network is a Fourth Generation (4G) wireless broadband technology which is capable of delivering high data transmission rates and low latency with reduced costs, among other promises.

The parallel interference cancellation (PIC) algorithm has a lower processing delay but poorer performance. Based on the features of SIC and PIC algorithms, an integrated PIC and OSIC detection (IPOD) algorithm is proposed which can lower the complexity as well as the processing delay of the whole algorithm with little performance loss. Moreover, there is an alterable parameter in IPOD algorithm which can be changed to obtain different trade off between complexity and performance. Thus, the proposed algorithm is more feasible for practical applications.","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073494.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection Algorithm for V-BLAST Systems with Novel Interference Cancellation Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detection Algorithm for V-BLAST Systems with Novel Interference Cancellation Technique","htmlLink":"/document/5073494/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10704175","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection Algorithm for V-BLAST Systems with Novel Interference Cancellation Technique","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-10-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077085S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073495,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Sykora","affiliation":["Czech Technical University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Sykora","id":"37284752600"},{"name":"Miroslav Hekrdla","affiliation":["Czech Technical University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Hekrdla","id":"37936908100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073495","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Modulation coding","Pulse modulation","Rayleigh channels","Multidimensional systems","Constellation diagram","Matched filters","Filtering","Mutual coupling","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","computational complexity","continuous phase modulation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication","minimum shift keying","orthogonal codes","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear subspace projector","burst block orthogonal STC CPM modulation","MIMO channel","space-time codes","fading Rayleigh channel","optimal receiver","multidimensional matched filtering","suboptimal complexity","receiver linear preprocessor","optimal linear projector matrix","determinant optimization","eigenvector problem solution","1D subspace projector","burst Alamouti coded MSK modulation","multiple-input multiple-output channel","continuous phase modulation"]}],"abstract":"We consider a general burst block orthogonal space- time coded CPM modulation in MIMO slowly fading Rayleigh channel.

In this paper, we consider the problem of coordinated beamforming where base stations (BS) equipped with multiple antennas attempt to serve a separate user each despite the interference generated by the other bases. We propose a framework for a distributed optimization of the beamformers at each base, where distributed is defined as using \"local CSIT\" only. We present and compare two distributed approaches (one iterative and another direct approach) which have in common the optimization of the beamformers as a combination of so-called egoistic and altruistic solutions for this problem. We provide the intuitions behind these approaches and some theoretical grounds for optimality in certain cases. Performance is finally illustrated through numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Beamforming Coordination in Multicell MIMO Channels","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073500","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073500.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Beamforming Coordination in Multicell MIMO Channels","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073500/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704180","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Beamforming Coordination in Multicell MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-01-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042343S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073501,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenza Giupponi","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Lorenza","lastName":"Giupponi","id":"37281677900"},{"name":"Christian Ibars","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Ibars","id":"37295876200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073501","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Interference","Game theory","Receivers","Frequency","Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Telecommunications","Irrigation","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed cooperation","cognitive radio networks","secondary unlicensed users","primary licensed users","underlay paradigm","overlay paradigm","game theory","quality of service","outage probability","interference temperature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073501","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073501","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","abstract":"This paper studies the benefits that cooperation brings to a cognitive radio network.

In this paper, we derive an optimal distributed power control strategy aiming at the total capacity maximization of secondary network with interference constraints to primary users. Due to the nonconvexity of system utility, geometric programming is introduced to transform nonconvex optimization problems into convex optimization problems. Furthermore, system utility is usually coupled which means each utility depends not only on its local variables but also on the variables of other utilities. We introduce auxiliary variables and extra equality constraints to transfer the coupling in utility to coupling in constraints. The solution of the proposed power control strategy is shown to be globally optimal and leads to excellent performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Geometric-Programming-Based Power Control in Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073504","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073504.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Geometric-Programming-Based Power Control in Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073504/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704184","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Geometric-Programming-Based Power Control in Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-03-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05206S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073506,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Arulselvan","affiliation":["Motorola India Private Limited, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Arulselvan","id":"37424746600"},{"name":"Vinod Ramachandran","affiliation":["Motorola India Private Limited, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Vinod","lastName":"Ramachandran","id":"37434992400"},{"name":"Suresh Kalyanasundaram","affiliation":["Motorola India Private Limited, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Suresh","lastName":"Kalyanasundaram","id":"37371077800"},{"name":"Guang Han","affiliation":["Motorola, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Han","id":"37287067600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073506","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":461},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Multiaccess communication","Femtocells","Macrocell networks","Interference","Frequency","Throughput","Degradation","Surges","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","distributed control","indoor radio","power control","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power control mechanism","HSDPA femtocell","indoor coverage","3G networks","macrocell performance","private access","femtocell interference"]}],"abstract":"Femtocells are low-cost, miniature base-stations intended to improve indoor coverage in 3G networks and beyond. One of the main issues in adopting femtocells en masse is the surge in interference to the mobile users served by the macrocell arising from unplanned networks and private access. Therefore, distributed power control mechanisms for femtocells are essential to shield the existing users of the macrocell as well as to enable scalable femtocell deployments. This paper studies several such power control schemes that strike an effective balance between the throughput of the femto users and the degradation in macrocell performance.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073506","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073506.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Power Control Mechanisms for HSDPA Femtocells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Power Control Mechanisms for HSDPA Femtocells","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073506/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704202","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073506/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Power Control Mechanisms for HSDPA Femtocells","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-06-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052934S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073507,"authors":[{"name":"Yohannes D.

Depending on the channel conditions between sensors (sensor- to-sensor channel) and between the sensor and the radio (user-channel), we explore three different modes of sensing where sensors provide the sensing information either cooperatively or independently.

Indeed, spatial multiplexing (SM) and Alamouti code are already in use in WiMAX systems based on IEEE 802.16e specifications. But more efficient full-diversity full-rate codes, such as Golden code, are still under discussion and have been proposed for future evolutions of the standards. However, the maximum likelihood (ML) or ML-like decoding of these codes is still not feasible for practical implementation. Existing papers include performance comparisons of such complex codes limited to simple scenarios and their performances in a real WiMAX environment have not been discussed in detail. In this paper, we present the performances of the Golden code, which is known to be the best full-rate full-diversity 2times2 STC, on a 2times2 downlink MIMO transmission and compare them with those of SM. The results show that the well-known performance advantage of Golden code over SM diminishes when real system scenarios are considered using powerful channel codes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Performance Analysis of Full-Rate STCs in 2x2 MIMO WiMAX Systems","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073513","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073513.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Performance Analysis of Full-Rate STCs in 2x2 MIMO WiMAX Systems","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073513/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704207","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Performance Analysis of Full-Rate STCs in 2x2 MIMO WiMAX Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"12-01-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048535S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073515,"authors":[{"name":"David Lopez-Perez","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Network Design, Bedfordshire University, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lopez-Perez","id":"38277422500"},{"name":"Alpar Juttner","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Network Design, Bedfordshire University, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Alpar","lastName":"Juttner","id":"37398645200"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Network Design, Bedfordshire University, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281474400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073515","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":436},"abstract":"In order to avoid inter-cell interference, OFDMA networks are flexible in terms of radio resource management techniques, supporting different frequency reuse schemes (FRSs), which in turn, may decrease inter-cell interference and increase network performance. However, because most of them are based on fix patterns, these FRSs cannot cope with the uneven distribution and dynamic behavior of the traffic throughout the day. This work introduces a novel approach to the frequency assignment problem called dynamic frequency planning (DFP) tailored to OFDMA networks. The proposed approach dynamically adapts the radio frequency parameters to the environment taking the user and channel conditions into account. Moreover, a variant of DFP, called vertical DFP, based on the fractional frequency reuse schemes (FFRSs) concept is proposed. In comparison to the traditional FRSs, these techniques notably mitigate inter-cell interference and enhance network performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073515.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Frequency Planning Versus Frequency Reuse Schemes in OFDMA Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Interchannel interference","Bandwidth","Radiofrequency interference","Resource management","Telecommunication traffic","Radio frequency","Quality of service","WiMAX","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network management","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic frequency planning","OFDMA networks","intercell interference","radio resource management techniques","fractional frequency reuse schemes","orthogonal frequency division multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Frequency Planning Versus Frequency Reuse Schemes in OFDMA Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073515/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704209","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Frequency Planning Versus Frequency Reuse Schemes in OFDMA Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-10-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059396S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073520,"authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Beniero","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Finland","Nokia Siemens Networks, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Beniero","id":"37870101800"},{"name":"Simone Redana","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Redana","id":"37332516700"},{"name":"Jyri Hamalainen","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Jyri","lastName":"Hamalainen","id":"37269110200"},{"name":"Bernhard Raaf","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Raaf","id":"37332079000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073520","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1381},"abstract":"Current broadband wireless networks are characterized by large cell sizes.

However, the delta- sigma (Delta-Sigma) modulator in the EPWM transmitter generates quantization noise that degrades signal quality. In this paper, OFDM in-band noise characteristics of EPWM transmitters are analyzed for first and second order Delta-Sigma modulators. Distortion noise power due to envelope clipping of OFDM signals is also analyzed. The combined effects of noise and distortion on the error vector magnitude (EVM) and adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACLR) are examined. Simulations to validate the total performance were performed using the IEEE 802.11a OFDM signal. Results showed good agreement with analytical results considering a linear-approximation gain for the 1-bit quantizer in Delta-Sigma modulators. The first order EPWM transmitter provides slightly better EVM and ACLR values than second order EPWM transmitters, since the effective quantizer gain of second order Delta-Sigma modulators is smaller, that limits the noise- shaping capability of Delta-Sigma modulators. A 0.1% clipping probability for a first order EPWM transmitter with an oversampling ratio of 32 and a three-pole Butterworth bandpass filter gives an EVM of 1.8% and ACLR of-37.9 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073521.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Quantization Noise and Distortion in EPWM Transmitters for OFDM Signal Amplification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Distortion","Transmitters","OFDM modulation","Delta modulation","Pulse amplifiers","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse modulation","Signal generators","Noise generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","Butterworth filters","OFDM modulation","pulse width modulation","radio transmitters","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantization noise","quantization distortion","EPWM transmitters","OFDM signal amplification","envelope pulsewidth modulation transmitter","delta-sigma modulator","distortion noise power","error vector magnitude","adjacent channel leakage power ratio","IEEE 802.11 OFDM signal","noise shaping capability","clipping probability","three-pole Butterworth bandpass filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Quantization Noise and Distortion in EPWM Transmitters for OFDM Signal Amplification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073521/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704214","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Quantization Noise and Distortion in EPWM Transmitters for OFDM Signal Amplification","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-21-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059327S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073524,"authors":[{"name":"Badri Varadarajan","affiliation":["DSPS Research and Development Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Badri","lastName":"Varadarajan","id":"37331884100"},{"name":"Runhua Chen","affiliation":["DSPS Research and Development Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Runhua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276947000"},{"name":"Eko N.

The transmitter determines the users that are scheduled on each subband, and the data rate for each user. To enable these transmitter choices, each user feeds back a channel quality indicator (CQI), giving a compressed version of its observed signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) on all subbands. In this paper, we classify existing CQI compression schemes into symmetric and asymmetric schemes. Symmetric schemes aim to accurately represent the CQI on all subbands, and are shown to be suitable when the receiver cannot accurately predict the subbands on which it will be scheduled. This happens, for instance, when the receiver is fast-moving, or when a round- robin scheduler is employed, or during low load conditions. Asymmetric schemes, on the other hand, greedily achieve accuracy only in high-SINR subbands, and are shown to perform well in high-load cellular networks with proportional fair scheduling and low-speed users. We propose one new scheme in each category. Simulation results for a 3GPP LTE cellular network show that our proposed schemes achieve similar or better performance than the current best-M feedback scheme used in LTE, with 30% less overhead.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073524.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Channel Quality Feedback Schemes For OFDMA Systems With Different Schedulers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters","Frequency conversion","Feeds","Land mobile radio cellular systems","WiMAX","Digital signal processing","Research and development","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","data compression","feedback","frequency division multiple access","scheduling","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel quality feedback","OFDMA","orthogonal frequency division-multiple access","scheduling","transmitter","channel quality indicator","signal-to-interference-noise ratio","CQI compression","cellular networks","3GPP LTE cellular network","3GPP long term evolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Channel Quality Feedback Schemes For OFDMA Systems With Different Schedulers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073524/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718112","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Channel Quality Feedback Schemes For OFDMA Systems With Different Schedulers","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-13-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054756S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073525,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Bockelmann","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Bockelmann","id":"37568999500"},{"name":"Dirk Wubben","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Wubben","id":"37269338400"},{"name":"Karl-Dirk Kammeyer","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl-Dirk","lastName":"Kammeyer","id":"37270666500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073525","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073525","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","Frequency domain analysis","Communication systems","Channel coding","Error analysis","OFDM","Power engineering and energy","Power measurement","Gaussian distribution","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","channel coding","error statistics","interleaved codes","OFDM modulation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BICM-OFDM","power loading","adaptive coding","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel coding","convex optimization problem","bisection approach","frame error rate","bit interleaved coded modulation"]}],"abstract":"Adaptive coding and modulation is an important topic considering future communication systems.

Optimal precoding involves dirty paper coding (DPC) technique, and it is highly nonlinear and complex. On the other hand, complete inter-user interference cancellation using linear zero-forcing or block diagonalization precoding are suboptimal. Hence, we consider successive zero-forcing precoding, which achieves improved system throughput compared to block diagonalization by allowing users to work under limited interference. Due to the dimensionality constraint of linear precoding techniques user scheduling is required. The optimal user scheduling involves exhaustive search, which becomes very complex for realistic numbers of users and transmit antennas. In addition, for successive zero-forcing precoding the order in which users are precoded successively is important for sum rate maximization, which further increases the complexity of exhaustive search. In this paper we develop a low complexity greedy user scheduling algorithm for successive zero-forcing precoding, which incorporates various user ordering techniques. Simplified heuristic scheduling metrics are proposed, which are shown to perform close to the exhaustive search method. A suboptimal user ordering technique that is similar to the order, in which the proposed greedy user selection selects users, is proposed. Further simplification of regular greedy scheduling algorithm is obtained with the proposed intermediate user grouping technique. The proposed algorithm is of low complexity, but provides performance close to the highly complex exhaustive search algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073528.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient User Selection and Ordering Algorithms for Successive Zero-Forcing Precoding for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Scheduling algorithm","Base stations","Mobile antennas","Receiving antennas","Interference cancellation","Throughput","Interference constraints","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast channels","channel coding","greedy algorithms","interference suppression","MIMO systems","mobile radio","multiuser channels","precoding","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["successive zero-forcing precoding","multiuser MIMO downlink","mobile receiver","base station","multiple antennas","dirty paper coding","inter-user interference cancellation","complexity greedy user scheduling algorithm","suboptimal user ordering technique","intermediate user grouping technique","Gaussian multiuser broadcast channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient User Selection and Ordering Algorithms for Successive Zero-Forcing Precoding for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073528/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704229","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient User Selection and Ordering Algorithms for Successive Zero-Forcing Precoding for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-05-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050667S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5073534,"authors":[{"name":"Hongju Liu","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Hongju","lastName":"Liu","id":"37879434100"},{"name":"Yi Ma","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Ma","id":"37288992200"},{"name":"R.

However, the linear interpolation error induced by the mismatch between the linear interpolation model and the actual channel can be detrimental to high-data-rate systems operating in high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) range or high mobility scenario. In this paper, enhanced linear interpolation schemes with small time-direction interpolation error are proposed, particularly for the chunk-based OFDMA uplink. Unlike the conventional linear interpolation, which is based on the assumption that the real and imaginary parts of channel coefficients are separately linearly varying, the proposed schemes are based on an interesting observation that the amplitude and phase of a communication channel are also linearly varying within a short time duration, e.g. a chunk duration. Simulation results show the proposed schemes can effectively improve the performance.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073534","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073534.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Linear Interpolation Schemes for Chunk-Based OFDMA Uplink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073534/","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Linear Interpolation Schemes for Chunk-Based OFDMA Uplink","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718127","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073534/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Linear Interpolation Schemes for Chunk-Based OFDMA Uplink","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-13-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065805S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073537,"authors":[{"name":"Moustapha Ould El Aoun","affiliation":["Techtra research unit, High School of Communications of Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Moustapha","lastName":"Ould El Aoun","id":"37936916900"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["Techtra research unit, High School of Communications of Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37298260200"},{"name":"Hatem Boujemaa","affiliation":["Techtra research unit, High School of Communications of Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Hatem","lastName":"Boujemaa","id":"37327151300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073537","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Soft-Handover for DS-CDMA Systems using Complementary Error Correction Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073537","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Error correction codes","Base stations","Convolutional codes","Convolution","Rayleigh channels","Mobile antennas","Fading","Interleaved codes","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","code division multiple access","convolutional codes","error correction codes","Gaussian channels","Rayleigh channels","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-handover","DS-CDMA systems","error correction codes","base stations","mobile station","convolution codes","Hybrid ARQ III","turbo-decoding","recursive convolutional encoder","Gaussian channels","multipath Rayleigh fading channels"]}],"abstract":"In order to enhance soft-handover performance in the downlink of DS-CDMA systems, we propose to use different codes at the base stations in the active set to encode the information sequence targeted to a mobile station. For reliable information recovery, in case all links except one happen to be simultaneously in deep fade, self-decodable complementary punctured convolution codes, inspired from Hybrid ARQ III, are used. When turbo-decoding is feasible at the mobile station, new complementary codes, using different interleavers followed by a common systematic recursive convolutional encoder, are proposed for an additional enhancement in performance. Experimental evaluation of the enhancement in performance provided by complementary coding is carried for both Gaussian and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. The proposed coding schemes can provide very significant gains. In some cases, gains around 4 dB can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073537","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073537.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Soft-Handover for DS-CDMA Systems using Complementary Error Correction Codes","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718130","htmlLink":"/document/5073537/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Soft-Handover for DS-CDMA Systems using Complementary Error Correction Codes","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-03-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078494S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073538,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Su Han","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Su","lastName":"Han","id":"37402417800"},{"name":"Jun-Hee Jang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-Hee","lastName":"Jang","id":"37397562700"},{"name":"Hyung Jin Choi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung Jin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37290851000"},{"name":"Sung-Soo Kim","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Soo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37558337400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073538","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"abstract":"To mitigate the asynchronous ICI (inter-cell interference), SCM (spatial covariance matrix) of the asynchronous ICI plus background noise should be accurately estimated for MIMO-OFDMA (multiple-input multiple-output-orthogonal frequency division multiple access) system. Generally, it is assumed that the SCM of the asynchronous ICI plus background noise is estimated by using training symbols. However, it is difficult to measure the interference statistics for a long time and training symbol is also not appropriate for MIMO-OFDMA system such as LTE (3GPP long term evolution). Therefore, a noise reduction method is required to improve the estimation accuracy. Although the conventional time-domain low-pass type weighting method can be effective for noise reduction, it causes significant estimation error due to the spectral leakage in practical OFDM system. Therefore, we propose a time-domain sine type weighing method which can not only reduce the noise effectively minimizing estimation error caused by the spectral leakage but also implement frequency-domain moving average filter easily. By using computer simulation, we show that the proposed method can provide up to 3 dB SIR (signal to interference ratio) gain compared with the conventional method, and verify that the proposed method is attractive and suitable for implementation with stable operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073538.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Spatial Covariance Matrix Estimation for Asynchronous Inter-Cell Interference Mitigation in MIMO-OFDMA System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Interference","Noise reduction","Background noise","Time domain analysis","Estimation error","Frequency estimation","Frequency conversion","Time measurement","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cochannel interference","covariance matrices","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDMA system","spatial covariance matrix estimation","asynchronous intercell interference mitigation","interference statistics","3GPP long term evolution","noise reduction","estimation accuracy","computer simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Spatial Covariance Matrix Estimation for Asynchronous Inter-Cell Interference Mitigation in MIMO-OFDMA System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073538/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718131","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Spatial Covariance Matrix Estimation for Asynchronous Inter-Cell Interference Mitigation in MIMO-OFDMA System","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-07-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050515S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5073544,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Lopez-Benitez","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Lopez-Benitez","id":"38274759600"},{"name":"Anna Umbert","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Umbert","id":"37265633100"},{"name":"Fernando Casadevall","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Casadevall","id":"37265720900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073544","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":626},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Spectrum Occupancy in Spain for Cognitive Radio Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073544","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Performance evaluation","Frequency measurement","Current measurement","Radio spectrum management","Signal processing","Wireless networks","Frequency diversity","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum occupancy measurements","Spain","cognitive radio applications","spectrum scarcity problem","unlicensed users","licensed users","outdoor environment","frequency 75 MHz to 3 GHz"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) has been identified as a promising solution to the so-called spectrum scarcity problem. The basic idea of this paradigm is to allow unlicensed users to access in an opportunistic and non-interfering manner some licensed bands that are temporarily unoccupied by licensed users. CR is expected to significantly increase current spectrum usage. However, before this paradigm can turn into reality, a full understanding of the dynamic usage of spectrum is required. Current spectrum utilization has already been evaluated in some measurement campaigns. However, most of them were performed in USA and therefore evaluated the American spectrum regulation and utilization. Few studies have been carried out in other places. In this context, this paper presents spectrum occupancy measurements conducted in the frequency range from 75 MHz to 3 GHz in an outdoor environment in urban Barcelona, Spain. The measurements are analyzed and compared to the official spectrum regulations. The obtained results demonstrate the existence of a significant amount of spectrum available for the deployment of future CR networks.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073544","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073544.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Spectrum Occupancy in Spain for Cognitive Radio Applications","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718156","htmlLink":"/document/5073544/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Spectrum Occupancy in Spain for Cognitive Radio Applications","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-06-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13209S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5073545,"authors":[{"name":"Lennert Jacobs","affiliation":["TELIN Department DIGCOM Group, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lennert","lastName":"Jacobs","id":"37410159100"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["TELIN Department DIGCOM Group, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey","id":"37269902700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073545","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Block codes","Fading","Channel estimation","Receiving antennas","Random variables","Transmitting antennas","Antennas and propagation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","error statistics","fading channels","orthogonal codes","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exact BER analysis","square orthogonal space-time block codes","imperfect channel estimation","arbitrary fading channels","bit error rate","propagation channels","transmit antennas","receive antennas","PAM constellation","QAM constellation","numerical evaluation","Frobenius norm","channel matrix","random variables","diversity order"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution, we examine the effect of imperfect channel estimation on the bit error rate (BER) performance of square orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs).

We present the 4 times 4 MIMO channel measurements in the line-of-sight (LOS) environment in a small room. We reveal the difference of the channel capacity dependent on receiving positions by comparison of the vertical polarized antenna configuration (V) versus vertical and horizontal polarized antenna configuration (V/H). The position dependence of the received power, spatial correlation and eigen-values show that the dominant factor in the receiving positions achieving large channel capacity is changed according to the antenna configurations. This paper also provides that the channel capacity for V/H is larger than that of V at all the measured points, and is dominated by the decrease of the spatial correlation. We show that the channel capacity enhancement is small in the environment which direct wave is too dominant for V.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073547","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073547.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Assessment of the Channel Capacity in Indoor MIMO Systems Using Dual-Polarization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Assessment of the Channel Capacity in Indoor MIMO Systems Using Dual-Polarization","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073547/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718159","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073547/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Assessment of the Channel Capacity in Indoor MIMO Systems Using Dual-Polarization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-12-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053144S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073548,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo Valerio","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Center Vienna (ftw.), Vienna, Austria","University of Applied Science Technikum Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Valerio","id":"37296690700"},{"name":"Alessandro D'Alconzo","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Center Vienna (ftw.), Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"D'Alconzo","id":"37398077400"},{"name":"Fabio Ricciato","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Center Vienna (ftw.), Vienna, Austria","Universit\u00e0 del Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Ricciato","id":"37281623800"},{"name":"Werner Wiedermann","affiliation":["Mobilkom Austria AG, Austria"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Wiedermann","id":"37403382700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073548","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":451},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio cellular systems","Telecommunication traffic","Roads","Monitoring","Navigation","3G mobile communication","Ground penetrating radar","Mobile handsets","Signal generators","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","monitoring","packet radio networks","signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular network signaling","road traffic estimation","cellular-based road monitoring system","UMTS data collection","GPRS data collection","GSM","third-generation cellular networks"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution we address the problem of using cellular network signaling for inferring real-time road traffic information.

We apply turbo codes to encode sensors observations and transmit them to a fusion center over independent binary symmetric channels. It is shown in the literature that the fusion center can exploit the correlation between sensors observations to design a soft-input soft-output (SISO) global decoder. Then the fusion center iterates extrinsic information between the global decoder and the SISO decoder of the applied error correcting code to jointly estimate the source. Since we consider turbo codes, the joint decoding problem is generalized to the problem of exchanging extrinsic information between three SISO modules. In this paper, we first apply the sum-product algorithm to derive the rules that update extrinsic information for the global decoder. Then, we apply extended-serial decoding that is the best known structure for decoders consisting of three concatenated SISO modules. We compare the bit error rate achieved by extended-serial decoding with the one achieved by a separate decoding strategy, where the fusion center separately decodes each sensor's observation and then decides based on the majority of the outputs. Our simulations show that extended-serial decoding performs significantly better than separate decoding.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Iterative decoding","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor fusion","Error correction codes","Concatenated codes","Java","Working environment noise","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","decoding","error correction codes","error statistics","source coding","turbo codes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data gathering sensor networks","serial decoding","turbo coding","soft-input soft-output global decoder","error correcting code","sum-product algorithm","SISO modules","joint decoding","bit error rate","fusion center","concatenated modules","wireless sensor networks"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073550","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073550.pdf","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended-Serial Decoding for Turbo-Coded Data Gathering Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Extended-Serial Decoding for Turbo-Coded Data Gathering Sensor Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10718162","publicationDate":"April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073550/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended-Serial Decoding for Turbo-Coded Data Gathering Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-23-08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067623S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073554,"authors":[{"name":"Noe Yoon Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Noe Yoon","lastName":"Park","id":"37985544200"},{"name":"Young Ju Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young Ju","lastName":"Kim","id":"38185544200"},{"name":"Xun Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Li","id":"37677752400"},{"name":"Kwan Seob Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwan Seob","lastName":"Lee","id":"38254623300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073554","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Diversity reception","Transmitting antennas","Array signal processing","Fading","Transmitters","Fluctuations","Performance gain","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","query formulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","fast codebook index searching algorithm","quantized equal gain transmission","rough searching","accurate searching"]}],"abstract":"A simple, effective, fast codebook index searching algorithm for quantized equal gain transmission (QEGT) in MIMO systems is presented.

The field experimental results show that there is no performance gap between with and without precoding irrespective of the antenna configuration in a non-line of sight (NLOS) environment when a common precoding vector is applied over the entire signal bandwidth of 18 MHz and the maximum likelihood detection with QR-decomposition and M-algorithm (QRM-MLD) based algorithm is applied at the receiver. In a high correlation channel as observed in a line of sight (LOS) environment, there is also no performance gap between with and without precoding. However, in the high received SINR region, the throughput performance of the precoding with the PD configuration is worse than that without precoding since decoding errors occurred in both codewords, which are mapped onto two different transmitters, due to a significantly high received power gap between vertically and horizontally-polarized antennas.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073557","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073557.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field Experimental Results of E-UTRA Downlink with Precoding and Non-Precoding MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Field Experimental Results of E-UTRA Downlink with Precoding and Non-Precoding MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073557/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718169","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073557/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Experimental Results of E-UTRA Downlink with Precoding and Non-Precoding MIMO","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-18-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096062S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073560,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanye Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Yuanye","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407535600"},{"name":"Sanjay Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark","Birla Institute of Technology, Ranchi, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38658525500"},{"name":"Luis Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Garcia","id":"37538026400"},{"name":"Klaus I.

It is found that a properly chosen reuse factor with respect to cell size (which leads to different level of inter-cell interference), can offer up to 30% gain in average cell throughput and much higher gain for cell-edge user throughput in local area (LA).

However, due to the wide fluctuation of realistic traffic patterns, it could often occur that only a single or few users have active data that need to be sent. In 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO) rank one preceding based Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) reporting mechanism is reused for MU-MIMO. This is optimum for MU-MIMO if single user is served. Based on SU-MIMO Rank one reporting, CQI re-calculations at the Basestation (BS) are derived for Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) mode and Zero-Forcing (ZF) mode respectively. A novel flexible MU-MIMO scheme with rank and mode adaptation is thus proposed for the first time with this limited feedback information. Simulation examples are provided to confirm the advantage of proposed flexible MU-MIMO scheme over SU-MIMO with 3GPP LTE framework.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Multi-User MIMO with Limited Feedback","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073563","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073563.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Multi-User MIMO with Limited Feedback","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073563/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718194","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Multi-User MIMO with Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-12-08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042238S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073565,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin C.

The receiver of DOSM does not require estimation of channel fading coefficients, channel power, signal power, or noise power to decode the data symbols and the decision is based on the two consecutively received codewords. In, the transmission matrix of DOSM is based on complex square orthogonal designs which cannot achieve full data rate. Hence, we presented a constellation rotation strategy to enhance the rate of DOSM. In this paper, we construct the transmission matrix of DOSM from complex rectangular orthogonal designs and find that full-rate DOSM can be achieved with increased encoding block length. An upper bound of the pair-wise error probability (PEP) for DOSM in Rayleigh fading channels is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed DOSM outperforms the differential space-time block code (DSTBC) with full diversity and the existing differential SM schemes in terms of error-rate performance over quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073568","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073568.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Samarium","Fading","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas","Decoding","Upper bound","Pairwise error probability","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","matrix algebra","probability","Rayleigh channels","space division multiplexing","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-rate differential orthogonal spatial multiplexing","channel fading coefficients","transmission matrix","constellation rotation strategy","complex rectangular orthogonal designs","encoding block length","pair-wise error probability","Rayleigh fading channels","differential space-time block code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Full-Rate Differential Spatial Multiplexing from Orthogonal Designs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073568/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073568/","accessionNumber":"10718199","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Rate Differential Spatial Multiplexing from Orthogonal Designs","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-07-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061571S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073571,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"},{"name":"Marco Krondorf","affiliation":["Vodafone Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Krondorf","id":"37828291700"},{"name":"Steffen Bittner","affiliation":["Vodafone Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Bittner","id":"37625953100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073571","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":310,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":11813},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073571","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency division multiplexing","TV","White spaces","OFDM","Pulse shaping methods","Digital filters","Transceivers","Wideband","Tail","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized frequency division multiplexing","generalized digital multi-carrier transceiver concept","spectrum fragmentation","frequency domain multi-user scheduling","time domain multi-user scheduling"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the GFDM system, a generalized digital multi-carrier transceiver concept. GFDM is based on traditional filter bank multi-branch multi- carrier concepts which are now implemented digitally. Our GFDM approach exhibits some attractive features which are of particular importance for scenarios exhibiting high degrees of spectrum fragmentation. Spectrum fragmentation is a typical technical challenge of digital dividend use cases, exploiting spectrum white spaces in the TV UHF bands which are located in close proximity to allocated spectrum. Specifically, the GFDM features are a lower PAPR compared to OFDM, a ultra-low out-of- band radiation due adjustable Tx-filtering and last but not least a block-based transmission using cyclic prefix insertion and efficient FFT-based equalization. GFDM enables frequency and time domain multi-user scheduling comparable to OFDM and provides an efficient alternative for white space aggregation even in heavily fragmented spectrum regions.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073571","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073571.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GFDM - Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"GFDM - Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073571/","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718202","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073571/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GFDM - Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-11-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035903S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"310","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5073575,"authors":[{"name":"Shaohong Wu","affiliation":["Wireless Theor. & Technol.

Due to its low costs, high grade of service, promotion of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC) and no change of core network, it has drawn close attention from the standardization organizations and the industrial field. In the two-hierarchy networks composed of traditional macro cellular networks and the embedded femtocell hotspots, moving mobiles will face up to the continual handovers when they pass along buildings. In this paper, handover algorithms considering signal strength and velocity are proposed using the mathematics concept of \"set\". Different handover methods are discussed and simulated. The results show that the proposed algorithms can obviously cut down unnecessary handovers compared with conventional soft handover on the same handover signal level limit. What's more, throughput of high speed mobiles and the total throughput of macro base station are increased.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073575","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073575.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handover Study Concerning Mobility in the Two-Hierarchy Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073575/","displayDocTitle":"Handover Study Concerning Mobility in the Two-Hierarchy Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718206","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073575/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handover Study Concerning Mobility in the Two-Hierarchy Network","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-14-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041535S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073577,"authors":[{"name":"Tazuko Tomioka","affiliation":["Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tazuko","lastName":"Tomioka","id":"37431296400"},{"name":"Takeshi Tomizawa","affiliation":["Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Tomizawa","id":"37717668300"},{"name":"Takahiro Kobayashi","affiliation":["Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37403577500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073577","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Transceivers","Frequency","Computational modeling","Noise shaping","Throughput","Wideband","Shape","Protection","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fast Fourier transforms","interference suppression","probability","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-sensitivity carrier sensing","overlapped FFT","cognitive radio transceivers","noise suppression technique","energy detection method","broadband signal","false alarm probability","misdetection probability","fast Fourier transforms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073577","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073577","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","abstract":"A noise suppression technique using overlapped FFT for carrier sensing of cognitive radio is proposed. The energy detection method is modified. A broadband signal is FFTed and the averaged power of each bin throughout the carrier-sensing period is calculated and judged against a threshold. At the process, adjacent FFT frames are overlapped greatly but with sufficiently large interval compared to the sample-by-sample sliding window. As a result, the averaging effect of noise increases and false alarm (FA) and misdetection (MD) probabilities are improved with much smaller computation amount than the sample-by-sample sliding window case.

Identification of PCP-OFDM signals is therefore of great importance for the design of fair spectrum sharing mechanism, particularly at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)when synchronization is not achievable. The preceded cyclic prefix, multiplexed with the data-carrying OFDM signals, provides one unique and recognizable feature of PCP-OFDM signals. In this paper, a robust PCP-OFDM signal identification technique is proposed under very low SNR in the presence of unknown timing and carrier frequency offset (CFO). Robust performance with very low false alarm probability and short sensing time was achieved under various channel conditions including Rician, Rayleigh and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073582.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of PCP-OFDM Signals at Very Low SNR for Spectrum Efficient Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","OFDM","AWGN","Radiofrequency identification","Signal to noise ratio","Noise robustness","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Signal design","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cognitive radio","multiplexing","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PCP-OFDM signal","spectrum efficient communication","adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM system","preceded cyclic prefix","flexible transmission","cognitive radio communication","carrier frequency offset","Rician channel","Rayleigh channel","additive white Gaussian noise channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Identification of PCP-OFDM Signals at Very Low SNR for Spectrum Efficient Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073582/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718213","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of PCP-OFDM Signals at Very Low SNR for Spectrum Efficient Communications","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-01-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039795S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073585,"authors":[{"name":"Hyejung Jung","affiliation":["Motorola, Schaumburg, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Hyejung","lastName":"Jung","id":"37934317200"},{"name":"Mark Cudak","affiliation":["Motorola, Schaumburg, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Cudak","id":"37327097000"},{"name":"Kevin Baum","affiliation":["Motorola, Schaumburg, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Baum","id":"37278167300"},{"name":"Vijay Nangia","affiliation":["Motorola, Schaumburg, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Nangia","id":"37278167700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073585","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Signal analysis","Fluctuations","Nonlinear distortion","Degradation","Interchannel interference","Radio frequency","OFDM modulation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["out-of-band emission","DFT-SOFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM","power spectrum density","signal distortion","nonlinear power amplifier"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents statistical properties and the impact of out-of-band emission in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and in Discrete Fourier Transform Spread OFDM (DFT-SOFDM) on the link performance. The analysis on the power spectrum density shows that if the signal distortion by a nonlinear power amplifier is not considered, OFDM has the same average power spectrum density as DFT-SOFDM. Hence, the average out-of-band emission (OOBE) power is equal for both systems. However, the fourth- order moment of frequency-domain symbols of DFT-SOFDM is larger than for the case of OFDM, which leads to larger variance of OOBE power in DFT-SOFDM than in OFDM. The link simulation demonstrates that larger variance of OOBE power in DFT-SOFDM does not degrade the link performance of the victim system compared to OFDM as long as the average OOBE power is same. Furthermore, the impact of the intra-system interference due to nonlinear power amplifiers on the link performance is also investigated both for OFDM and DFT-SOFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073585","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073585.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Out-of-Band Emission in OFDM and in DFT-SOFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073585/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Out-of-Band Emission in OFDM and in DFT-SOFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718247","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073585/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Out-of-Band Emission in OFDM and in DFT-SOFDM","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-21-08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048129S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073587,"authors":[{"name":"Di Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Wu","id":"37654070700"},{"name":"Erik G.

With the resulting method, it is possible to carry out close-to ML detection for MIMO systems with a large number antennas (e.g. 4times4) using higher-order modulation schemes (e.g. 64-QAM) at low silicon cost in real-time.

A major drawback of PTS method is its higher computation complexity due to the necessity of larger number of inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFT). The PTS method with low computation complexity, called decomposition PTS sub-blocking was proposed [1] which employs the radix-*- inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) for the signals at the middle stages of an TV-point radix-*- IFFT and decimation in frequency (DIF) domain. This method (DIF-IFFT) can reduce the computation complexity relatively while providing PAPR reduction similar to other PTS techniques. On the other hand, PTS method can improve PAPR reduction performance very well as increasing a number of weighting factors and clusters. However, the size of side information proportionally increases as increasing the number of weighting factors or/and clutters, which are required to inform the side information to the receiver for recovering the original data. In this paper, we propose the new weighting factor technique in conjunction with D-PTS sub-blocking technique which can improve both the PAPR performance and computation complexity without any increasing of side information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved PTS Method with New Weighting Factor Technique for OFDM Signal","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073594","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073594.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved PTS Method with New Weighting Factor Technique for OFDM Signal","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073594/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10728813","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved PTS Method with New Weighting Factor Technique for OFDM Signal","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-22-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063345S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073595,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh K.

The use of EC provides a metric to quantify the maximum achievable rate under a certain delay constraint and in particular, we formulate the problem as a cross-layer resource allocation problem that connects the link-layer parameters such as delay and source rate with the physical-layer parameters such as fading statistics and power control. The object is to minimize the transmission energy of the MIMO systems while meeting the EC constraints, with the aid of the channel statistics. By deriving a closed-form expression for the EC of a single-user link MIMO system, we address multiuser MIMO systems in the downlink, in which dynamic time (or spectrum) sharing and multiuser power control are performed if time-division multiple-access (TDMA) (or frequency-division multiple-access (FDMA)) is used. We show that the optimal resource-allocation solution can be obtained by a dynamic programming (DP) approach and more importantly, low-complexity near-optimal heuristic solutions are proposed.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073598","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073598.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Energy Efficiency for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Effective Capacity Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving Energy Efficiency for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Effective Capacity Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073598/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718259","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073598/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Energy Efficiency for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Effective Capacity Constraints","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"10-08-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050271S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073603,"authors":[{"name":"Sadia Quadri","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Sadia","lastName":"Quadri","id":"37408869700"},{"name":"Russell J.

An important consideration within industrial research is the transfer of technology from the research domain to business units. Prototypes are a tangible example that aid in explanation and dissemination of the developed intellectual property. In this paper, we present a common architecture of the Wireless Evaluation Research Platform (WERP), developed at Toshiba Telecommunications Research Laboratory. WERP is used for prototyping and analysis of algorithms that aid in technology transfer.

The optimization of the beamforming weights is done with semideflnite programming with the knowledge of long term channel state information (CSI). This paper presents a fair beamforming technique that results in a very low signal to interference and noise rate (SINR) feedback rate.

It groups the active user terminals (UT) in a low and high signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) group and picks UTs from both groups in each scheduling round to optimally exploit the interference variations introduced by SFR. We show that the proposed interference aware phased scheduling scheme for SFR improves the 5 percentile of the user throughput cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the average cell throughput compared to reuse one. In addition to better performance the reduced feedback option of the proposed phased scheduler reduces the feedback load by two third for UTs in the low SINR group with a moderate decrease in the 5 percentile of the user throughput CDF while keeping the same average cell throughput. Further, our system simulation results show that SFR clearly outperforms fractional frequency reuse, a competing interference coordination scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Aware Scheduling for Soft Frequency Reuse","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073608","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073608.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference Aware Scheduling for Soft Frequency Reuse","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073608/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718309","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Aware Scheduling for Soft Frequency Reuse","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-09-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044885S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5073609,"authors":[{"name":"Angela Hernandez","affiliation":["Research Institute of Engineering in Arag\u00f3n, I3A, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Hernandez","id":"37551367700"},{"name":"Israel Guio","affiliation":["Research Institute of Engineering in Arag\u00f3n, I3A, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Guio","id":"37596900800"},{"name":"Antonio Valdovinos","affiliation":["Research Institute of Engineering in Arag\u00f3n, I3A, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Valdovinos","id":"37284818200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073609","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Radio spectrum management","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency conversion","Engineering management","System performance","Proposals","Wireless networks","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","multicell broadband OFDMA network","inter-cell interference management","heuristic adaptive power allocation algorithm","subcarrier allocation algorithm","frequency reuse","mobile broadband wireless network"]}],"abstract":"This work addresses the problem of inter-cell interference (ICI) management in the context of single frequency broadband OFDMA-based networks.

Frequency reuse factor of 1 being proposed for the next generation mobile systems will lead to 1 or 2 dominant interferers. We propose in this paper a low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) demodulator for interference suppression. The proposed demodulator is also applicable to general multi-stream (spatially multiplexed) MIMO systems where it reduces one complex dimension of the system i.e. the complexity of ML detection reduces from O (|chi|\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">eta</sup>\n) to O(|chi|\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">eta-1</sup>\n) where n is number of transmit antennas/spatial streams. This is a fundamental result as space and technology constraints shall be restricting future MIMO systems to low dimensionality. Therefore reduction of one complex dimension in detection shall enable implementation of ML detectors at the receivers. We look at the performance of linear MMSE demodulator and the proposed demodulator in the presence of interferers of diverse strengths and rates and simulation results demonstrate much improved performance of the proposed demodulator for interference suppression.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Suppression for Next Generation Wireless Systems","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073610","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073610.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference Suppression for Next Generation Wireless Systems","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073610/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718311","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Suppression for Next Generation Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-09-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041808S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073611,"authors":[{"name":"Pekka Janis","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Signal Processing Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Janis","id":"37392237400"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Signal Processing Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"},{"name":"Cassio Ribeiro","affiliation":["Wireless Systems and Services Laboratory, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Cassio","lastName":"Ribeiro","id":"37268401300"},{"name":"Juha Korhonen","affiliation":["Wireless Systems and Services Laboratory, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Korhonen","id":"37939189400"},{"name":"Klaus Doppler","affiliation":["Wireless Systems and Services Laboratory, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Doppler","id":"37399272500"},{"name":"Klaus Hugl","affiliation":["Wireless Systems and Services Laboratory, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Hugl","id":"37399272900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073611","dbTime":"61 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":278,"citationCountPatent":34,"totalDownloads":4825},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Cellular networks","Laboratories","Performance gain","Telecommunication traffic","Frequency synchronization","Signal processing","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","resource allocation","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","device-to-device radio","cellular networks","IMT-Advanced","device-to-device communication","D2D links","radio resource management","base station","multiuser diversity"]}],"abstract":"Future cellular networks such as IMT-Advanced are expected to allow underlaying direct Device-to-Device (D2D) communication for spectrally efficient support of e.g. rich multimedia local services.

Similar to the layered OFDMA concept, it was agreed at the 3GPP RAN WG1 meeting that the entire transmission bandwidth in LTE-advanced should comprise multiple frequency blocks called component carriers to achieve a wider system bandwidth than that for the current LTE (Rel-8 LTE). We investigate the optimum radio parameters in the frequency domain including the need for an inter-component carrier guard band (GB). In the simulation evaluations, we set the parameters for the receiver filter assuming the worst case that satisfies the minimum requirement specified in Rel-8 LTE. Simulation results show that the loss in the average received signal energy per symbol-to-noise power spectrum density ratio (Es/No) satisfying the required block error rate compared to the case without an inter-component carrier GB is negligible irrespective of the modulation scheme and coding rate. As a result, we conclude that the inter-component carrier GB is unnecessary and can be minimized to 19 subcarriers in the downlink while retaining the same number of subcarriers within a component carrier as that for Rel-8 LTE.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation on Optimum Radio Parameter Design in Layered OFDMA for LTE-Advanced","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073618","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073618.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Investigation on Optimum Radio Parameter Design in Layered OFDMA for LTE-Advanced","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073618/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718319","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on Optimum Radio Parameter Design in Layered OFDMA for LTE-Advanced","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-03-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045241S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073625,"authors":[{"name":"Wooram Shin","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wooram","lastName":"Shin","id":"37692970000"},{"name":"Seung Joon Lee","affiliation":["Kangwon University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Joon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37367720800"},{"name":"Dong Seung Kwon","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Seung","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37335531000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073625","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":111},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative LMMSE Channel Estimation, Detection, and Decoding with A Priori Information for ST-BICM Systems over Block Fading Channels","abstract":"Recently, researches on space-time codes deploying multiple transmit and receive antennas have abruptly emerged due to its potential to greatly improve spectral efficiency. Particularly, space-time bit-interleaved coded modulation (ST-BICM) gives rise to very reliable bit error rate (BER) performance with quite flexible rate compatibility. In this paper, we propose an iterative linear minimum-mean-squared-error (LMMSE) channel estimation, detection, and decoding for ST-BICM systems over block fading channels in order to resolve more practical problems concerned with the performance degradation due to imperfect channel state information (CSI). The LMMSE channel estimation and detection are performed using a priori information fed back from the soft-input / soft-output (SISO) channel decoder in a computational efficient manner.

In conjunction with MIMO transmission where different users interfere with each other, this effect strongly degrades the signal detection performance if it is not compensated beforehand. In the uplink of multi-user systems different CFOs between all mobile terminals occur whereas its correction is more difficult. In this paper we consider the uplink of a fully asynchronous system with different transmitter and receiver CFOs which appears in distributed MIMO systems with separate users and base stations. We describe a combined scheme for joint CFO correction and spatial layer detection in frequency domain. The detection performance is shown for some selected equaliser concepts. In this way we present interference cancellation algorithms with low and scalable complexity.

We propose a joint constrained optimization framework that considers the allocation of power levels across the relays subject to individual power constraints and the design of linear receivers for interference suppression. We derive constrained minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) expressions for the parameter vectors that determine the optimal power levels across the relays and the linear receivers. In order to solve the proposed optimization problem efficiently, we develop a joint adaptive power allocation and interference suppression stochastic gradient (SG) algorithm. The proposed SG algorithm mitigates the interference by adjusting the power levels across the relays and estimating the parameters of the linear receiver. An SG channel estimation algorithm is also derived to determine the coefficients of the channels across the base station, the relays and the destination terminal. The results of simulations show that the proposed methods obtain significant gains in performance and capacity over non-cooperative systems and cooperative schemes with equal power allocation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power Allocation and Interference Suppression Techniques for Cooperative CDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073635","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073635.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power Allocation and Interference Suppression Techniques for Cooperative CDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073635/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718355","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Power Allocation and Interference Suppression Techniques for Cooperative CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-21-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035417S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073636,"authors":[{"name":"Yidong Lang","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Yidong","lastName":"Lang","id":"37409632800"},{"name":"Dirk Wubben","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Wubben","id":"37269338400"},{"name":"Karl-Dirk Kammeyer","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl-Dirk","lastName":"Kammeyer","id":"37270666500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073636","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Spread spectrum communication","Relays","Decoding","Space time codes","Closed-form solution","Degradation","Resource management","Power engineering and energy","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO communication","radio networks","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint power-time allocation","adaptive distributed MIMO multihop networks","multihop relaying","cooperative diversity","space-time code","robust communication link","non ergodic outage probability"]}],"abstract":"Distributed MIMO multi-hop relaying can provide cooperative diversity and overcome path losses, hence, boost the end-to-end (e2e) performance.

However, even in those systems, joint resource allocation for uplink and downlink can improve system efficiency and we study this issue in this paper with the concept of the user-level utility function. In most cases, a user has a two-way communication that consists of two sessions: uplink and downlink sessions and its overall satisfaction to its communication depends on its satisfaction to each of its sessions. To model user's overall satisfaction to its communication, we define a user-level utility function, which is defined as a function of its session-level utility functions. We then formulate and solve the optimization problem with user-level utility functions for cell-level resource scheduling that jointly considers uplink and downlink resource allocation. Simulation results show that our cell-level scheduling in which resource allocation in both uplink and downlink is done jointly outperforms link-level scheduling, in which resource allocation in each of uplink and downlink is done separately in most cases, especially when the asymmetry between uplink and downlink is large.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073637.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Resource Allocation for Uplink and Downlink in Wireless Networks: A Case Study with User-Level Utility Functions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","Wireless networks","Quality of service","Mobile communication","Frequency conversion","Bandwidth","Councils","Cellular phones","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","telecommunication links","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint resource allocation","uplink","downlink","wireless networks","user-level utility functions","cell-level resource scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint Resource Allocation for Uplink and Downlink in Wireless Networks: A Case Study with User-Level Utility Functions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073637/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718357","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Resource Allocation for Uplink and Downlink in Wireless Networks: A Case Study with User-Level Utility Functions","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-08-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054515S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5073639,"authors":[{"name":"Xinning Wei","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Xinning","lastName":"Wei","id":"37878946800"},{"name":"Tobias Weber","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Weber","id":"37273310400"},{"name":"Alexander Kuhne","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Laboratory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Kuhne","id":"37396353500"},{"name":"Anja Klein","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Laboratory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Anja","lastName":"Klein","id":"37288187900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073639","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Transmission with Imperfect Partial Channel State Information","abstract":"The knowledge of the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) on data transmission techniques is helpful to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. In this paper, based on the proposed cooperative downlink (DL) transmission scheme applying adaptive scheduling of mobile stations (MSs), significant channel selection, and joint transmission (JT) with partial CSI, i.e., JT considering only part of the useful channels and the interference channels, a novel performance assessment is performed taking imperfectness of the CSI into consideration.

The question about how much CSI should be taken into consideration as a function of the extent of imperfectness of the CSI in order to achieve optimum system performance is answered based on numerical results.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073639.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073639","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073639","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073639","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel state information","Adaptive scheduling","System performance","Interference channels","Iterative algorithms","Degradation","Land mobile radio","Mobile antennas","MIMO","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","numerical analysis","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint transmission","imperfect partial channel state information","wireless communication systems","cooperative downlink transmission scheme","adaptive scheduling","mobile stations","channel selection","interference channels","numerical results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073639/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Transmission with Imperfect Partial Channel State Information","accessionNumber":"10718359","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073639/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Transmission with Imperfect Partial Channel State Information","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-12-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046682S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073640,"authors":[{"name":"A.

There is still significant room for improvement of latency in 3 G NWs to provide the best quality of experience for broadband services, therefore, latency is a key parameter that should be taken into account in future 3G NW configurations. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the high impact latency has on current Mobile NWs and also to present ways that should be followed to reduce RTT, based on real NW measurements. In realizing this challenge, the current state of HSPA NWs in terms of latency have been analyzed, the sensitivity to latency of that traffic carried by the 3G NW quantified and measuring the proportional contribution of RTT from all the elements of the NW. Initial analysis shows that the UTRAN is, currently, the predominant factor in E2E latency for 3G NWs and therefore this study focuses more on this aspect. The next step has been to study the reduction of latency on 3G real NWs by means of current technology optimization(s) and planned technology deployment. Finally, it was investigated how QoS differentiation can be optimised for sustaining RTT over a potentially congested NW in several of its interfaces and/or nodes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Video sharing","3G mobile communication","Mobile communication","Quality of service","Current measurement","Radio access networks","Radio control","Control systems","Ground penetrating radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband mobile networks","mobile 3G networks","transport network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073642","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073642.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latency in Broad-Band Mobile Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Latency in Broad-Band Mobile Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073642/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073642/","accessionNumber":"10718381","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latency in Broad-Band Mobile Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-18-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065909S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5073645,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Kumar","affiliation":["University of Aalborg, Denmark","Birla Institute of Technology, Ranchi, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38658525500"},{"name":"Valentina Palma","affiliation":["University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Valentina","lastName":"Palma","id":"37936833300"},{"name":"Erwann Borgat","affiliation":["University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Erwann","lastName":"Borgat","id":"37938081500"},{"name":"Nicola Marchetti","affiliation":["University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Marchetti","id":"37293742400"},{"name":"P.

The channel estimation is introduced and its impact on the system performance is evaluated under different channel conditions. The main contribution is to address the impact of the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocol on the WiMAX system performance. For DL, the schemes include single-input single-output (SISO), Alamouti space-time block coding (STBC), and spatial multiplexing, i.e., vertical coded 2times2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). For UL, the transmission schemes include SISO and 1times2 SIMO. It is observed that the HARQ protocol can improve the system performance dramatically, typically 2 ~ 3.5 dB gain in SNR from the first retransmission. The retransmission gain is also found to be relatively independent of the number of receive antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073648.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link Level Simulation Study of Downlink MIMO and Uplink HARQ in IEEE 802.16e WIMAX System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","WiMAX","System performance","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Channel estimation","Automatic repeat request","Access protocols","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mobile radio","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["link level simulation","downlink MIMO","uplink HARQ","IEEE 802.16e","WiMAX system","channel estimation","hybrid automatic repeat request protocol","space time block coding","spatial multiplexing","retransmission gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Link Level Simulation Study of Downlink MIMO and Uplink HARQ in IEEE 802.16e WIMAX System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073648/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718387","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link Level Simulation Study of Downlink MIMO and Uplink HARQ in IEEE 802.16e WIMAX System","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-11-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069072S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073653,"authors":[{"name":"Botao Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectrics & Microprocessor, School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Botao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405128700"},{"name":"Hengzhu Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectrics & Microprocessor, School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Hengzhu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405272000"},{"name":"Xucan Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectrics & Microprocessor, School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xucan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37933107100"},{"name":"Dongpei Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectrics & Microprocessor, School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Dongpei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37896487400"},{"name":"Xiaofei Yi","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectrics & Microprocessor, School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Yi","id":"37932967500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073653","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":490},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073653","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital video broadcasting","Parity check codes","Scheduling algorithm","Message passing","Bit error rate","Iterative decoding","Throughput","Code standards","Microprocessors","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","parity check codes","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity DVB-S2 LDPC decoder","low density parity check decoder","row message passing offset min-sum algorithm","COMS technology"]}],"abstract":"The decoding complexity is the main issue in designing DVB-S2 Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoder.

The proposed scheme exploits a low complexity MMSE equalizer and a partial MMSE-OSIC equalizer appropriately, according to symbol selection algorithm. This algorithm chooses the number of selected symbols which should be detected by the OSIC scheme based on the required reliability (RR) of each subchannel.

One of the approaches is to replace power amplifiers with the Linear Amplification using Nonlinear Components (LINC) block. However, this produces additional nonlinear distortions caused by amplitude or phase mismatch between two power amplifiers inside the LINC block. In this paper, we introduce a noble LINC calibration technique that utilizes the channel estimator block that is initiated by the Media Access Control (MAC) layer during the Distributed Interframe Space (DIFS) or Short Interframe Space (SIFS). For DIFS or SIFS, pilot symbols are allocated in a payload field and then the outputs of the transmitter are internally forwarded to the receiver to characterize the LINC channel with a pilot-aided Least Square Error (LSE) channel estimator. By applying a reverse distortion onto information symbols after the LINC channel distortion is obtained by channel estimation, we can significantly improve the Symbol Error Rate (SER) and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of the OFDM system with the LINC transmitter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAC Controlled LINC Calibration using Pilot-Aided LSE Channel Estimator for OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073661","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073661.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"MAC Controlled LINC Calibration using Pilot-Aided LSE Channel Estimator for OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073661/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718419","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAC Controlled LINC Calibration using Pilot-Aided LSE Channel Estimator for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-11-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05945S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073662,"authors":[{"name":"David Martin-Sacristan","affiliation":["ITEAM, Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia Applications, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Martin-Sacristan","id":"38275339500"},{"name":"Jorge Cabrejas","affiliation":["ITEAM, Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia Applications, Spain"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Cabrejas","id":"38278010700"},{"name":"Daniel Calabuig","affiliation":["ITEAM, Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia Applications, Spain"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Calabuig","id":"37294145900"},{"name":"Jose F.

Moreover, additional performance can be extracted in the presence of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. However, channel estimation error usually exists in practical systems and leads to imperfect CSI. As a result, the system performance is degraded. Fortunately power allocation can mitigate the problem effectively. In this paper, the power allocation problem is investigated in the case of imperfect CSI with accurate system model. A greedy power allocation (GPA) algorithm with adaptive modulation scheme is proposed to maximize the system data rate while satisfying each data stream's bit error rate requirement. Simulation results show that GPA can reduce the effects of imperfect CSI and obtain better performance than other traditional algorithms, e.g. waterfilling and equal power allocation algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073665","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073665.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Data Rate Power Allocation for MIMO Spatial Multiplexing Systems with Imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Data Rate Power Allocation for MIMO Spatial Multiplexing Systems with Imperfect CSI","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073665/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718423","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073665/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Data Rate Power Allocation for MIMO Spatial Multiplexing Systems with Imperfect CSI","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-07-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061824S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073667,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Indeed, the near-far effect provides extremely reliable transmissions between near nodes, regardless of node density, which can not be achieved by CSMA/CA. However, CDMA can not be directly applied in realistic traffic accident scenarios, where highly reliable transmissions are required between far nodes as well. This paper proposes to apply packet forwarding and transmission scheduling methods that try to expand the area, where reliable transmissions are achievable. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves approximately 100% of delivery ratio and 4 milliseconds of delay in a realistic traffic accident scenario, where CSMA/CA achieves approximately 60% of delivery ratio and 80 milliseconds of delay.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073667.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Message Dissemination in Inter-Vehicle CDMA Networks for Safety Driving Support","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Safety","Broadcasting","Road accidents","Delay","Frequency","Ad hoc networks","Vehicle crash testing","Unicast","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","carrier sense multiple access","code division multiple access","scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-vehicle CDMA networks","message dissemination","safety driving support","ad hoc networks","packet transmissions","CSMA","realistic traffic accident scenarios","packet forwarding scheduling","packet transmission scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Message Dissemination in Inter-Vehicle CDMA Networks for Safety Driving Support","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073667/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718425","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message Dissemination in Inter-Vehicle CDMA Networks for Safety Driving Support","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"08-03-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075769S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073668,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Fitch","affiliation":["Research and Venturing, British Telecommunications Public Limited Company, Ipswich, UK"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Fitch","id":"37342983200"},{"name":"Hui Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37287669300"},{"name":"Alister G.

The issue of deciding when to send updates is addressed in this paper and two metrics for making this decision are compared. One is obtained from the correlation matrix distance (CMD) which measures how far the MIMO channel has moved over a time interval, the other is a novel approach using mutual information (MI), whereby two calculations of MI are made, the first assuming that water-filling is employed at the transmitter and the second assuming that it is not. Using CMD, updates are sent when the correlation distance becomes greater than a given threshold. Using MI, updates are sent when the channel changes to the extent that the capacity with water-filling becomes less than that without. Matlab simulation results for a 2 * 2 MIMO system show that the two metrics result in a similar overhead, both being more efficient than constant interval. Extension to larger antenna arrays should be straightforward. MI, although computationally more intensive, can extend easily to decide when to switch between spatial multiplexing (SM) and diversity modes using space-time block coding (STBC) if the channel rank collapses.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073668.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metrics to Decide the Feedback Interval in Closed-Loop MIMO-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","MIMO","Transmitters","Switches","OFDM","Frequency estimation","State estimation","Time measurement","Mutual information","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","channel estimation","correlation methods","diversity reception","MIMO communication","multiplexing","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback interval","closed-loop MIMO-OFDM systems","closed-loop multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","channel estimation","channel state","correlation matrix distance","MIMO channel","mutual information","correlation distance","channel capacity","Matlab simulation results","MIMO system","antenna arrays","spatial multiplexing","diversity modes","space-time block coding","channel rank","channel modelling","water filling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Metrics to Decide the Feedback Interval in Closed-Loop MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073668/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718426","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metrics to Decide the Feedback Interval in Closed-Loop MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-12-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036916S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073670,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Lan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Lan","id":"37686874100"},{"name":"Daniel K.

In this paper, we investigate the VRA system in spatially multiplexed orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which is a promising scheme for next generation of downlink communication. To create VRA in OFDM, various fractionally spaced timing offset is imposed to each transmit substream, and oversampling at the receiver filter output. To explore the potential of the VRA-OFDM system, this paper analyzes its system capacity and error rate performance. Results show that the VRA-OFDM system can achieve higher ergodic capacity and outage rate, and lower outage probability than conventional MISO-OFDM system. Due to the created virtual antennas, ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC) can be used in the VRA-OFDM system, which favours the use of VRA in downlink communication due to lower complexity. Meanwhile, if maximum likelihood (ML) detection is used, the VRA-OFDM system shows better BER performance than the conventional overloaded MISO-OFDM ML receiver.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073670","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073670.pdf","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO OFDM System with Virtual Receive Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"MIMO OFDM System with Virtual Receive Antennas","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073670/","accessionNumber":"10718428","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073670/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO OFDM System with Virtual Receive Antennas","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-22-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057433S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073672,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Unfortunately, the optimum transmission mode for users that are interference limited depends to a large extent on the transmission mode used by interfering base stations. This paper proposes interference-aware link adaptation where base stations exchange their transmission plans with neighboring base stations and broadcast this information to the active users. Each user measures its long term susceptibility to spatial interference and returns this information to the base station via a spatial mode table. The base stations then schedule active users according to the decisions made in interfering base stations and the preferred transmission strategies of its own users.

The novel structures for detection exploit different patterns and orderings for the modification of the original feedforward and feedback filters design. We present minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimators for the multi-branch structure and the design of MIMO receivers and show that the proposed MMSE design does not require a significant additional complexity. The proposed multi-branch MMSE DF detectors are compared with several existing detectors in the literature via computer simulations and are shown to close the gap between MMSE detectors and the optimal maximum likelihood detector.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073677","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073677.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Mean-Squared Error Multi-Branch Decision Feedback Detection for MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073677/","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Mean-Squared Error Multi-Branch Decision Feedback Detection for MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718435","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073677/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Mean-Squared Error Multi-Branch Decision Feedback Detection for MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-11-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058004S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073679,"authors":[{"name":"I.

For such purpose two types of burst are defined: localized and distributed. A new resource allocation and scheduling algorithm that exploits such structure is then proposed. Furthermore, the effects of limited feedback are also investigated where only the n-best subchannel quality metrics are feedback. As shown in the simulation results, a tradeoff between spectral efficiency, delay and load signaling requirements is obtained which can be adjusted by modifying the number of subchannels signaled in the uplink. Additionally, the proposed scheme turns out to be a very efficient way to increase the system fairness and therefore improving the quality of service.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed TUSC and Band AMC Permutation Zone in OFDMA Systems with Limited Feedback","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073679","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073679.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Mixed TUSC and Band AMC Permutation Zone in OFDMA Systems with Limited Feedback","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073679/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718437","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed TUSC and Band AMC Permutation Zone in OFDMA Systems with Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-17-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043484S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073681,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Nguyen-Le","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Hung","lastName":"Nguyen-Le","id":"38275020100"},{"name":"Tho Le-Ngoc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Tho","lastName":"Le-Ngoc","id":"37271236200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073681","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Channel estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency synchronization","Multipath channels","Cost function","Robustness","Fading","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ML-based joint estimation","carrier frequency offset","doubly selective channels","OFDM transmissions","pilot-aided joint channel estimation","burst-mode orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM systems","maximum likelihood cost function","joint synchronization","Cramer-Rao lower bounds","fast fading channels","linear minimum mean square algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a pilot-aided joint channel estimation and synchronization scheme for burst-mode orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over time- and frequency-selective (doubly selective) channels. By exploiting the basis expansion model (BEM) for representing doubly-selective channels, a maximum likelihood (ML) cost function of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and BEM coefficients is formulated to develop a ML framework for the joint synchronization and channel estimation problem. Inheriting the properties of the ML estimation, the proposed estimator is unbiased and its mean-squared-error (MSE) performance achieves Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) asymptotically (for a large data records). Simulation results demonstrate that, over a wide range of Doppler spreads, the proposed estimation scheme offers a high robustness against the time variation of fast fading channels and outperforms the linear minimum mean square (LMMSE) algorithm. In addition, the ML-based algorithm achieves CRLB at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073681","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073681.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML-Based Joint Estimation of Carrier Frequency Offset and Doubly Selective Channels for OFDM Transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073681/","displayDocTitle":"ML-Based Joint Estimation of Carrier Frequency Offset and Doubly Selective Channels for OFDM Transmissions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718459","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073681/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML-Based Joint Estimation of Carrier Frequency Offset and Doubly Selective Channels for OFDM Transmissions","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-21-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052986S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073682,"authors":[{"name":"Lan Wang","affiliation":["DOCOMO, Beijing Communications Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37635153700"},{"name":"Yongsheng Zhang","affiliation":["DOCOMO, Beijing Communications Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538316200"},{"name":"Zhenrong Wei","affiliation":["DOCOMO, Beijing Communications Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenrong","lastName":"Wei","id":"37928782600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073682","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":1459},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile radio mobility management","Radio network","Femtocells","Base stations","Macrocell networks","Costs","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Cellular networks","Radio access networks","Electromagnetic interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","mobility management (mobile radio)","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility management schemes","radio network layer","long term evolution","LTE femtocells","cellular base station","network capacity","3G networks","mass deployment"]}],"abstract":"Femtocell, a small cellular base station in home and small business environment, is an attractive solution for operators to improve indoor coverage and network capacity in 3G networks.

The hybrid-decision scheme mixes between the characteristics of the soft-decision decoding scheme and the hard- decision decoding scheme to reduce the computational complexity of the whole decoding algorithm. The modification proposed in this paper is applied to the implementation-efficient reliability ratio weighted bit-flipping (IERRWBF) algorithm which represents hard-decision scheme in the hybrid algorithm. This modification is capable of achieving better performance than that of the hybrid decoding algorithm with reducing the number of iterations required at each SNR and approaching more to the performance of the SPA.

The max* operation is performed on n>2 rather than on only two inputs, as it is in the conventional approach. The approximation uses a very simple max operation and a look-up table (LUT) with only eight stored values. Complexity comparison reveals a significant reduction in the number of operations required per decoding step for the presented approximation, as compared with the conventional Log-MAP decoding. Performance evaluation results are presented for both turbo and TTCM codes, showing the near-optimal performance of the novel approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Iterative decoding","Modulation coding","Table lookup","Wireless communication","Bit error rate","Degradation","Concatenated codes","Convolutional codes","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["table lookup","trellis coded modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified log-map algorithm","turbo codes","turbo TCM codes","log-MAP decoding","turbo trellis-coded modulation codes","look-up table"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073689","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073689.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Log-MAP Algorithm for Simplified Decoding of Turbo and Turbo TCM Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modified Log-MAP Algorithm for Simplified Decoding of Turbo and Turbo TCM Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073689/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073689/","accessionNumber":"10718467","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Log-MAP Algorithm for Simplified Decoding of Turbo and Turbo TCM Codes","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"12-01-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051504S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5073690,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Hao Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Hao","lastName":"Fang","id":"37575827700"},{"name":"Ju-Ya Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ju-Ya","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293034000"},{"name":"Ming-Der Shieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Der","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37266682200"},{"name":"Jing-Shiun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jing-Shiun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37577603500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073690","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Blind equalizers","Computational complexity","Fading","Time domain analysis","Computational modeling","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","channel estimation","computational complexity","error statistics","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified subspace based channel estimation algorithm","OFDM systems","modified subspace-based blind channel estimation algorithm","signal matrix","computational complexity","mean-squared error","bit error rate","static channel"]}],"abstract":"A modified subspace-based blind channel estimation algorithm for OFDM systems is proposed in this paper.

Based on the ICI distributions, we try to extend the conventional MIMO detection schemes. Nevertheless this extension increases the computational complexity significantly whereas the performance gain is not satisfactory. To improve the capability of ICI cancellation, we employ successive interference cancellation (SIC) method not in MIMO detection but in ICI cancellation. However, the processing delay time due to the SIC in OFDM will grow according to the increase of the number of subcarriers. To overcome this effect, we propose a modified SIC (MSIC) that can reduce the processing delay dramatically at the expense of some performance degradation. In simulation, we show the expense is so small that it can be ignored in severe time-selective channels.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073691","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073691.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Successive Interference Cancellation for MIMO OFDM on Doubly Selective Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modified Successive Interference Cancellation for MIMO OFDM on Doubly Selective Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073691/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718469","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073691/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Successive Interference Cancellation for MIMO OFDM on Doubly Selective Channels","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-23-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.153192S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073693,"authors":[{"name":"Klas Johansson","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Klas","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37270842900"},{"name":"Johan Bergman","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Bergman","id":"37931760600"},{"name":"Dirk Gerstenberger","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Gerstenberger","id":"37926010000"},{"name":"Mats Blomgren","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Blomgren","id":"37689078600"},{"name":"Anders Wallen","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Wallen","id":"37936357800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073693","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":761},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073693","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Continuous improvement","Multiaccess communication","Delay","System performance","Downlink","Radio access networks","Physical layer","Throughput","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","mobile radio","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier HSPA evolution","radio access technology","mobile broadband service","WCDMA/HSPA","multicarrier operation","carrier aggregation","radio access network","bursty packet","high speed packet access"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073693","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073693.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Carrier HSPA Evolution","abstract":"The HSPA Evolution will during the next decade be a key radio access technology for a cost-effective provisioning of mobile broadband services. In addition to the continuous improvements of WCDMA/HSPA in terms of spectral efficiency and latency, \"multi-carrier operation\" (or \"carrier aggregation\") for individual connections is now introduced. This paper presents the evolution of Multi-Carrier HSPA, discusses implications on network architecture & user equipment, and evaluates the achievable system performance (with focus on downlink). It is concluded that Multi-Carrier HSPA can be implemented at a low incremental cost; both in the radio access network, which already supports multiple carriers, and in terminals (due to synergies with LTE). Numerical results further show that achievable data rates of a Multi-Carrier HSPA system increase proportional to the number of carriers; in terms of peak physical layer data rates as well as (for bursty packet data) average user throughput. Thus, Multi-Carrier HSPA will be an attractive means for operators to provide higher data rates and decrease the production cost of mobile broadband access.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073693/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10718471","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073693/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Carrier HSPA Evolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Carrier HSPA Evolution","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-01-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038095S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073696,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In all the cells, each transmitter (BS or RS) controls the power allocation on each subchannel to maximize its own utility in a distributed way. In the first time subslot, a match factor is defined for considering the mismatch between the first hop link data rate and the second hop link data rate and the pricing factor for the RS will be adjusted adaptively by this match factor. As a Nash equilibrium is used to determine the solution of this problem, the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium are studied.

To achieve proportional fairness among users while improving user's satisfaction in the upper layer, e.g. application and transmission control protocol (TCP) layers, we propose a novel multi-layer optimization approach for packet scheduling in OFDMA-based cellular systems, whereby the scheduler is designed not only based on optimization of the quality-of-service (QoS) class in the application layer, and fairness over users, but also based on the optimization of the throughput performance in the TCP layer. Simulations are conducted using TCP applications with the ultra mobile broadband (UMB) air interface numerology. Simulation results show that the proposed packet scheduling achieves up to 27.3% improvement over the proportional fairness scheduler in terms of the average system TCP throughput in the TCP layer, when resource usable rate for TCP applications is lower. Meanwhile, the proposed packet scheduling also performs with comparable fairness in the physical layer relative to the proportional fairness scheduler.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073701.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Layer Optimized Packet Scheduling for OFDMA-Based Cellular Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Throughput","Physical layer","Protocols","Frequency conversion","Performance evaluation","Noise measurement","Design optimization","Control systems","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","scheduling","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer optimized packet scheduling","OFDMA-based cellular system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","proportional fairness scheduler","quality-of-service","QoS","TCP layer","ultra mobile broadband air interface","resource usable rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Layer Optimized Packet Scheduling for OFDMA-Based Cellular Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073701/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10703995","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Layer Optimized Packet Scheduling for OFDMA-Based Cellular Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-04-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040599S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073703,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojuan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaojuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405051600"},{"name":"Yi Gong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Gong","id":"37271888700"},{"name":"Gaoxi Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Gaoxi","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37280918900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073703","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Decoding","Relays","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Multiple access interference","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Access protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","decoding","error statistics","least mean squares methods","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","decode-and-forward cooperative relaying","DS-CDMA systems","multiple access interference","MMSE","bit-error-rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the uplink of a Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) system, where the source users cooperate in relaying each other's message to the destination node based on the decode-and-forward relaying protocol.

Simulation results show that the cooperative relaying significantly outperforms the direct transmission. Among the three partner selection strategies, Max- Cooperate achieves the lowest average BER. It is found that when the number of users increases, the BER performance of direct transmission gets worse, but the BER performance of Max- Cooperate improves significantly. For All-Cooperate and Sue- Cooperate selection strategies, the number of users does not have much impact on the BER performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Detection for Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relaying in DS-CDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073703","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073703.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Detection for Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relaying in DS-CDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073703/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10703997","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Detection for Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relaying in DS-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-12-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039508S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073704,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-P.

To avoid the complexity of joint-detection, a multi-stage successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector or parallel interference cancellation (PIC) detector is used as an implementation of MUD. To further reduce complexity, time-division multiplexing (TDM) is used to separate user groups in time so that MUD can focus on a smaller number of overlapping signals. SIC or PIC cancels a number of temporarily detected user signals from the receive signal before detecting another user signal. A temporarily detected user signal can be regenerated based on demodulated data or decoded data, and based on hard-decision values or soft-decision values. We find that a two-stage SIC or PIC process improves VoIP performance significantly and having more detection stages beyond two does not further improve performance by much. The improved performance allows a VoIP user to reduce the average transmit power, which translates to VoIP capacity and coverage increases. Furthermore, we find that the individual user performance is not sensitive to its detection order. We also quantify the relative performance between the various signal regeneration schemes considered. As expected, post-decoding interference cancellation (IC) offers a significant gain over pre-decoding IC. Furthermore, we find that post-decoding IC is robust to traffic load variations. Also, soft-decision based cancellation achieved the best performance. However, the performance improvement is small compared to hard-decision based cancellation. Finally, we see that MUD can work with G-Rake to suppress one dominant other-cell interfering signal, e.g., due to a high-data-rate user in another cell.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-User Detection for Improving VoIP Capacity and Coverage in WCDMA Uplink","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073704","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073704.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-User Detection for Improving VoIP Capacity and Coverage in WCDMA Uplink","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073704/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10703998","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-User Detection for Improving VoIP Capacity and Coverage in WCDMA Uplink","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-12-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057684S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073705,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Clerckx","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Clerckx","id":"37269077900"},{"name":"David Mazzarese","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Mazzarese","id":"37293996200"},{"name":"Gil Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gil","lastName":"Kim","id":"37674981200"},{"name":"Sungjin Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungjin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279279100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073705","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Feedback","Statistics","Quantization","Receiving antennas","Broadcasting","Transmitting antennas","Gas insulated transmission lines","Paper technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multiuser channels","statistical analysis","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO downlink","IEEE 802.16m","muliple input-multiple output technology","time correlated channel","spatially correlated channel","channel statistics","codebook design"]}],"abstract":"Multi-User (MU) Muliple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) has become an essential technology to achieve IMT advanced requirements.

The results of computer simulation show that our proposal with a lager roll-off factor can reduce the PAPR more effectively compared with conventional OFDM and CI/OFDM.

A single-cell multiuser system model is formulated that provides system capacity estimates accounting for the signaling overhead. Different scheduling granularities are considered, including the one used in the specifications for the 3G Long Term Evolution (LTE). A greedy scheduling method is assumed, where each resource is assigned to the user for which it can support the highest number of bits. The simulation results indicate that the cost of control signaling does not outweigh the scheduling gain, when compared with a simple round-robin scheme that does not need signaling of scheduling information. Furthermore, in the studied scenario, joint coding and signaling of scheduling information over all selected users is found to be superior to separate coding and signaling for each user. The results also indicate that the scheduling granularity used for LTE provides better performance than the full granularity.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073719","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073719.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Coding of Scheduling Information in OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Coding of Scheduling Information in OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073719/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704013","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073719/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Coding of Scheduling Information in OFDM","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-08-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04154S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073721,"authors":[{"name":"Moussa Diallo","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Moussa","lastName":"Diallo","id":"37540908000"},{"name":"Rodrigue Rabineau","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Rodrigue","lastName":"Rabineau","id":"37545546000"},{"name":"Laurent Cariou","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Cariou","id":"37299003800"},{"name":"Maryline Helard","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Maryline","lastName":"Helard","id":"37269770700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073721","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":261},"abstract":"This paper deals with a novel transform domain channel estimation (TD-CE) based on discrete cosine transform (DCT) for the MIMO-OFDM system.

Such errors degrade the performance of an OFDM receiver by introducing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) into the systems. Traditionally, designing an OFDM receiver needs plenty of Monte Carlo simulations because the synchronization errors are simultaneously inevitable in practical environments. Therefore, we formulate the theoretical signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) to assist the design of OFDM receivers. By knowing the required SINR of specific application, all combinations of allowable errors can be derived.

In literature the effect of channel uncertainty at the receiver is often investigated with the assumption that channel estimation errors are identically distributed and independent of both SNR and channel correlation values. In this paper we extend the analysis by considering correlation among the channel estimation errors as typically happen when the MIMO channel to be estimated is spatially correlated. We propose and study upper and lower bounds on the MIMO channel capacity giving emphasis to the impact of the resulting channel estimation error, through its covariance matrix. The role played by the effective SNR and spatial correlation is studied by detailing the results to MIMO systems employing linear MMSE channel estimators.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073728","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073728.pdf","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Effect of Imperfect Channel Estimation upon the Capacity of Correlated MIMO Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Effect of Imperfect Channel Estimation upon the Capacity of Correlated MIMO Fading Channels","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073728/","accessionNumber":"10704042","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073728/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Effect of Imperfect Channel Estimation upon the Capacity of Correlated MIMO Fading Channels","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-04-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060798S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5073729,"authors":[{"name":"Menguc Oner","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Menguc","lastName":"Oner","id":"37268389500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073729","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Cognitive radio","Signal sampling","Statistics","Chromium","Frequency","Degradation","Timing jitter","Signal analysis","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","signal sampling","timing jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random sampling jitter","spectrum sensing algorithms","cognitive radio receiver","communication signals","random timing jitter","cyclostationary statistics"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio is an enabling technology, which is expected to lead to a more efficient utilization of the available spectral resources due to its flexibility and its ability to sense its spectral environment. Recently, spectrum sensing methods based on exploiting the cyclostationary characteristics of communication signals have been drawing considerable interest. Imperfections in the cognitive radio receiver that affect the cyclic statistics of a signal of interest may lead to a degradation in the performance of spectrum sensing algorithms based on cyclostationarity. One such typical source of imperfection is random timing jitter in the sampling process. In this work, we explore the effect of random sampling jitter on the second order cyclostationary statistics of wide sense cyclostationary signals. General analytical expressions are derived for the cyclic statistics of sampled signals in the presence of sampling jitter and specific results are provided for two cases of interest. Subsequently, the effect of the jitter on a spectrum sensing algorithm is investigated via simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Effect of Random Sampling Jitter on Cyclostationarity Based Spectrum Sensing Algorithms for Cognitive Radio","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073729","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073729.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Effect of Random Sampling Jitter on Cyclostationarity Based Spectrum Sensing Algorithms for Cognitive Radio","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073729/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704043","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Effect of Random Sampling Jitter on Cyclostationarity Based Spectrum Sensing Algorithms for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-01-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046093S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073731,"authors":[{"name":"Symeon Chatzinotas","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Chatzinotas","id":"37265267500"},{"name":"Muhammad Ali Imran","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Muhammad Ali","lastName":"Imran","id":"37265529100"},{"name":"Reza Hoshyar","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Hoshyar","id":"37267960100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073731","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","MIMO","Gaussian channels","Communication systems","Dispersion","Delay lines","Frequency domain analysis","Fourier transforms","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","channel capacity","correlation methods","dispersive channels","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","fading channels","Fourier transforms","frequency selective surfaces","frequency-domain analysis","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","probability","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ergodic channel capacity","wideband MIMO channel","flat-fading Gaussian channel","wireless channels","time dispersive channel","frequency selective channel","tapped delay line model","time domain model","frequency domain model","Fourier transform","channel matrix","nonseparable correlation","Gaussian blocks","asymptotic eigenvalue probability density function","operator-valued free probability","channel model parameters"]}],"abstract":"In the ergodic capacity literature, the majority of results preserve the assumption of a flat-fading Gaussian channel. However, the actual wireless channels in current communication systems are often wideband and therefore time dispersive and frequency selective. In this direction, we study the ergodic capacity of a wideband MIMO channel. Starting from a tapped delay line model for the time domain, the frequency domain model is derived by employing the Fourier transform. However, in both cases the resulting channel matrix is characterised by non-separable correlation amongst the Gaussian blocks. The asymptotic eigenvalue probability density function and the channel capacity are calculated by specializing a theorem originating in operator-valued free probability.

In this paper we focus on one such technique, beamforming, in the downlink channel. In each sector, a number of fixed beams are used to serve UEs (User Equipment). For each frame, the scheduler chooses a beam and then schedules one or more UEs that lie within that beam. Since the power is focused on a narrow beam then the served UEs can achieve higher rates and the sector coverage is also increased. However, this beam causes more interference in adjacent sectors. If a neighboring sector schedules a UE that lies within the coverage of this beam then the rate for that UE will be low. The neighboring sectors must therefore schedule UEs outside of the beam or at least know of the interference that will be experienced. The first approach (interference avoidance) requires coordination among the sectors with the associated communication overheads and delays. In this paper we follow the second approach and assume no coordination among sectors except for the fact that they all use the same beam cycle period. Although all NBs use the same beam cycle period, they may occasionally change the specific beam schedule based on local factors such as the geographical distribution of UEs within its beams. Such changes should be made infrequently since the approach is based on the assumption that the interference experienced by a UE repeats with the beam cycle period.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073735","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073735.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073735","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Downlink Beamforming with Synchronized Beam Cycles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Downlink Beamforming with Synchronized Beam Cycles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073735/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073735/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704049","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Downlink Beamforming with Synchronized Beam Cycles","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-18-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073892S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073736,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Xiao","affiliation":["Queen's University Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37268994500"},{"name":"Jinsong Wu","affiliation":["Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jinsong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279164000"},{"name":"Mathini Sellathurai","affiliation":["Queen's University Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Mathini","lastName":"Sellathurai","id":"37285072400"},{"name":"T.

The space-time coded CDMA systems are also compared to the MIMO CDMA system based on spatial multiplexing, some recommendations are made on how to design a practical MIMO CDMA system based on the comparative studies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On The Performance of Space-Time Coded Multiuser MIMO Systems with Iterative Receivers","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073736","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073736.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On The Performance of Space-Time Coded Multiuser MIMO Systems with Iterative Receivers","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073736/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704050","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On The Performance of Space-Time Coded Multiuser MIMO Systems with Iterative Receivers","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-08-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076278S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073737,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Jalloh","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Jalloh","id":"37662087200"},{"name":"Pankaj Das","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pankaj","lastName":"Das","id":"37285357200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073737","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Phase noise","Channel estimation","Diversity reception","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate","Ice","Block codes","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","diversity reception","error statistics","OFDM modulation","phase noise","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit and receive diversity","OFDM systems","phase noise","imperfect channel estimation","maximal ratio combining","space-time block codes","multiple transmit antennas","receive antenna","Rayleigh fading environment","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the effects of phase noise in the presence of imperfect channel estimation (ICE) on the performance of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) wireless systems with receive diversity employing maximal ratio combining (MRC) and transmit diversity for Space-Time Block Codes (STBC) with multiple transmit antennas and one receive antenna in a Rayleigh fading environment.

In this paper, we address the design of opportunistic spectrum access for cognitive radio system employing cooperative spectrum sensing. The opportunistic spectrum access strategy contains two parts: an access policy to maximize the transmission throughput in each channel, and a cooperative spectrum sensing strategy to maximize the overall transmission throughput of the cognitive network. We first propose the optimal access policy as an optimal tradeoff point between transmission collision and overlooked opportunity in each channel. Then the optimal cooperative spectrum sensing strategy is studied to solve the following questions: to what extent each cognitive user should cooperate with others and which part of spectrum it should choose to sense.

Both the transmitter as well as the receiver are assumed to know the channel matrix perfectly. It is well known that, for linear MIMO transceivers, a diagonal transmission (i.e., orthogonalization of the matrix channel) is optimal for some criteria. Surprisingly, it was shown five years ago that for the family of Schur-convex functions an additional rotation of the symbols is necessary. However, if the bit loading is optimized jointly with the linear transceiver, then the rotation is unnecessary. Similarly, for DF MIMO transceivers, a rotation of the symbols is sometimes needed. The main result of this paper shows that for a DF MIMO transceiver where the bit loading is jointly optimized with the transceiver filters, the rotation of the symbols becomes unnecessary and, consequently, also the DF part of the receiver is not required.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073744","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Bit Loading for MIMO Systems with Decision Feedback Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Bit Loading for MIMO Systems with Decision Feedback Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073744/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704077","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073744/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Bit Loading for MIMO Systems with Decision Feedback Detection","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-07-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059096S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073746,"authors":[{"name":"Antonios Alexiou","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, Research Academic Computer Technology Institute, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Antonios","lastName":"Alexiou","id":"37322297900"},{"name":"Christos Bouras","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, Research Academic Computer Technology Institute, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Bouras","id":"37273224300"},{"name":"Vasileios Kokkinos","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, Research Academic Computer Technology Institute, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Kokkinos","id":"37304164900"},{"name":"Evangelos Rekkas","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, Research Academic Computer Technology Institute, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Evangelos","lastName":"Rekkas","id":"37304127700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073746","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":314},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073746","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Long Term Evolution","Mobile TV","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Multimedia communication","TV broadcasting","Instruments","Standardization","3G mobile communication","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadcast antennas","MIMO communication","mobile radio","multimedia communication","power control","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal MBMS power allocation","MIMO antennas","LTE network","mobile network","multimedia service","multimedia broadcast","multicast service","Universal Mobile Telecommunication System","downlink capacity","power control scheme","power resources"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073746","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073746.pdf","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal MBMS Power Allocation Exploiting MIMO in LTE Networks","abstract":"In the frame of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) of mobile networks, the provision of rich multimedia services, such as Mobile TV, is considered of key importance for the LTE proliferation in mobile market. To this end, Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) is envisaged to play an instrumental role during LTE standardization process. MBMS was introduced in the Release 6 of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) in order to deliver multimedia data from a single source entity to multiple destinations. However, downlink capacity in such networks is limited by base station transmission power. As an aftermath, in MBMS efficient power allocation techniques should be implemented so as to ensure the mass provision of multimedia applications to mobile users. In this paper we propose a power control scheme for efficient selection of MBMS bearers. The proposed mechanism on the one hand manages to economically utilize power resources during MBMS transmissions, while on the other hand exploits the performance enhancements emerged from Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas used in LTE networks.

Detection of the occupancy status of the slots is characterized by false alarm probability and detection probability. The detection probability needs to be large enough to protect primary user. However, too large detection probability means increased false alarm probability thus reducing the secondary users transmit opportunities. We study finding the optimum false alarm and detection probabilities. Numerical results indicate that the secondary users maximum throughput is obtained when the random access probabilities are equal to one and random access is handled instead with false alarm probabilities.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073752.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Detection Parameters for Time-Slotted Cognitive Radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073752/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Detection Parameters for Time-Slotted Cognitive Radios","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704085","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Detection Parameters for Time-Slotted Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-02-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11696S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073755,"authors":[{"name":"Hee-Nam Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hee-Nam","lastName":"Cho","id":"37401955700"},{"name":"Jin-Woo Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin-Woo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292735200"},{"name":"Yong-Hwan Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Hwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281125100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073755","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power system relaying","Array signal processing","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Bandwidth","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","relays","telecommunication channels","telecommunication power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum power allocation","beamforming based regenerative dual-hop","MISO relay channels","end-to-end capacity","signal-to-noise ratio","transmit beamforming"]}],"abstract":"We consider a power allocation strategy to maximize the end-to-end capacity of a regenerative dual-hop multiple-input single-output (MISO) relay channel with the use of transmit beamforming.

Numerical results of the outage probabilities are presented to illustrate the performance improvement due to cooperative diversity.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073756","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073756.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probability Analysis of Wireless Relay and Cooperative Networks in Rician Fading Channels with Different K-Factors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073756/","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability Analysis of Wireless Relay and Cooperative Networks in Rician Fading Channels with Different K-Factors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704089","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073756/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability Analysis of Wireless Relay and Cooperative Networks in Rician Fading Channels with Different K-Factors","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"10-06-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057548S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073757,"authors":[{"name":"Rachita Dahama","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Rachita","lastName":"Dahama","id":"37547203500"},{"name":"Kevin W.

A key requirement for CRs is to limit the interference to the licensed system. However, the variability in the radio channel caused by fading and shadowing makes this task more difficult. In this paper the performance of the licensed system has been analysed by calculating the probability of outage of the licensed receiver (LR). A Poisson field of CRs is considered such that the CRs are distributed uniformly around the LR. A circular exclusion zone of radius R has been defined with the LR at the center so that CRs are permitted to transmit only if they are outside this zone. For the first time, expressions for outage probabilities have been developed for different values of R, taking into account the variability in the radio channel. Rayleigh, lognormal and Suzuki channels have been analysed. The effects of channel characteristics on the outage probability have been investigated. Results show the extent to which increasing R improves the performance of the licensed system significantly.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073757.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probability Estimation for Licensed Systems in the Presence of Cognitive Radio Interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073757/","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability Estimation for Licensed Systems in the Presence of Cognitive Radio Interference","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704090","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability Estimation for Licensed Systems in the Presence of Cognitive Radio Interference","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-06-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06132S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073760,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Muller","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Muller","id":"37288909400"},{"name":"Joachim Speidel","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Speidel","id":"37269778600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073760","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Decoding","Relays","Diversity reception","Signal processing","MIMO","Radio frequency","Channel state information","Signal analysis","Genetic expression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage-optimal transmit antenna selection","cooperative decode-and-forward systems","cooperative diversity","regenerative relays","information outage probability","single-hop systems","channel state information"]}],"abstract":"We propose and analyze three different transmit antenna selection schemes for cooperative diversity systems with regenerative relays.

In the eigenmode MIMO-OFDM system, a transmitter performs linear precoding using channel state information (CSI), and thus excellent transmission performance can be achieved. However, the transmitted signal still has high PAPR because of OFDM characteristics. To reduce such PAPR, this paper enhances selected mapping (SLM) and partial transmit sequence (PTS) which are known as PAPR reduction methods for OFDM. The enhanced methods, which are referred to as eigenmode transmission SLM (EM-SLM) and eigenmode transmission PTS (EM-PTS), can be applied to the eigenmode MIMO- OFDM without any performance degradation.

In this paper, we consider a cooperative communication system operating in an amplify-and-forward (AF) mode with an imperfectly-known relay fading channel.

A simple and easy-to-evaluate asymptotical upper bound (AUB) of the symbol-error-rate (SER) is derived for uncoded AF cooperative systems with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. Based on the AUB, we propose a criterion for the choice of parameters in the PSAM scheme, i.e., the pilot spacing and the Wiener filter length. We also formulate an optimum power allocation problem for the considered system. The optimum power allocation can be found by means of a gradient search over a continuous range.

Proposed a PAPR reduction method termed polyphase interleaving and inversion (PII) for MIMO-OFDM systems under the use of the space-frequency block coding (SFBC). In this paper, we find more degrees of freedom can be utilized among the multiple antennas for the SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems. Hence, we present four additional cross-antenna SFBC patterns, and based on these patterns, we propose two new efficient PAPR reduction schemes for SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems. The simulation results show that, even with the same computational complexity, the proposed scheme would have better PAPR reduction performance than the PII method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Broadband communication","Wireless communication","Interleaved codes","Computational modeling","Computational complexity","Broadband antennas","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","broadband networks","computational complexity","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio reduction","cross-antenna translation","SFBC MIMO-OFDM systems","multiple-input multiple-output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","broadband wireless communications","PAPR reduction method","polyphase interleaving-inversion","space-frequency block coding","multiple antennas","computational complexity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073770","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073770.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction by Cross-Antenna Translation for SFBC MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction by Cross-Antenna Translation for SFBC MIMO-OFDM Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073770/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073770/","accessionNumber":"10704121","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction by Cross-Antenna Translation for SFBC MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-11-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032951S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5073771,"authors":[{"name":"Antonis Phasouliotis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Antonis","lastName":"Phasouliotis","id":"37937172700"},{"name":"Daniel K.

In particular, the pairwise error probabilities (PEP) for both systems are derived. Simulation results illustrate that when the number of users, hence the system load is low, MIMO MC-CDMA outperforms MIMO OFDMA. However when the system load increases, the performance of MIMO MC-CDMA deteriorates and becomes worse than MIMO OFDMA. This can be explained by the PEP analysis of MIMO MC- CDMA which shows that when the number of users is small, the multiuser interference is also small and frequency diversity is better exploited. Conversely at high system load, MIMO OFDMA outperforms MIMO MC-CDMA as it is insensitive to multiuser interference. Nevertheless if the other users' spreading sequences are available at the receiver of the desired user, the impact of multiuser interference can be minimised and MIMO MC-CDMA outperforms MIMO OFDMA at all system loads.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073771","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073771.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Comparison of Downlink MIMO MC-CDMA and MIMO OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Comparison of Downlink MIMO MC-CDMA and MIMO OFDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073771/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704122","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073771/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Comparison of Downlink MIMO MC-CDMA and MIMO OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-21-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057197S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073772,"authors":[{"name":"Youngpo Lee","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngpo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37539815600"},{"name":"Taeung Yoon","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taeung","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37584342900"},{"name":"Seungsoo Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungsoo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37290946900"},{"name":"Sun Yong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sun Yong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37695169700"},{"name":"Seokho Yoon","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokho","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37279393400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073772","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073772","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Cascading style sheets","Phase shift keying","Jamming","Delta modulation","Frequency","Chirp modulation","Signal analysis","Baseband","Data engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","chirp modulation","error statistics","jamming","phase shift keying","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CSS communication system","chirp spread spectrum technique","antijamming capability","wireless communication","symbol error rate","SER expressions","M-ary phase shift keying system","broadband jamming signal","tone jamming signal"]}],"abstract":"Due to its anti-jamming capability, chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technique has attracted much attention in the area of wireless communications.

In particular passive tags provide a promising, low cost and energy-efficient solution for inventory applications. However, their large-scale adoption strictly depends on the efficiency of the identification process. A major challenge is how to arbitrate channel access so that all tags are able to answer the reader inquiries and identify themselves over time. This paper stems from the observation that a variety of anti-collision protocols for RFIDs have been proposed in the literature. However, a thorough simulation comparison among them and a clear identification of the mechanisms resulting in better end- to-end performance is lacking. The objective of our work has been to fill this gap. This paper presents the results of a detailed ns2-based comparative evaluation of representatives of all the classes of anti-collision protocols so far proposed. Simulation results show that end-to-end performance of the different classes of protocols in terms of metrics such as the time needed for tags identification differ significantly over what previously found by experiments which only focused on the number of reading cycles for tag identification. Our thorough performance evaluation has highlighted that different solutions are to be used in different application scenarios and that decreasing the collisions (rather than idle times) is the way to go to further improve anti-collision protocols performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073775.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Anti-Collision Protocols for RFID Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Radiofrequency identification","Access protocols","Application software","Computer science","Costs","Energy efficiency","Large-scale systems","Backscatter","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anticollision protocols","RFID systems","automatic item identification","passive tags","ns2-based comparative evaluation","tag identification","radiofrequency identification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Anti-Collision Protocols for RFID Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073775/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704126","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Anti-Collision Protocols for RFID Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01-02-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056372S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":5073777,"authors":[{"name":"Salama S.

Cooperative-diversity networks use the neighbor nodes to assist the source by sending the source information to the destination for achieving spatial diversity. Regular cooperative-diversity networks make an inefficient use of the channel resources because relays forward the source signal to the destination every time regardless of the channel conditions. Incremental relaying cooperative diversity has been proposed to save the channel resources by restricting the relaying process to the bad channel conditions only. Incremental relaying cooperative relaying networks exploit limited feedback from the destination terminal, e.g., a single bit indicating the success or failure of the direct transmission. If the destination provides a negative acknowledgment via feedback; in this case only, the relay retransmits in an attempt to exploit spatial diversity by combining the signals that the destination receives from the source and the relay. In this paper, we study the end-to-end performance of incremental relaying cooperative-diversity networks using decode-and-forward relays over independent non-identical Rayleigh fading channels. Closed-form expressions for the bit error rate and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage probability are determined. Results show that the incremental relaying cooperative diversity can achieve the maximum possible diversity, compared with the regular cooperative-diversity networks, with higher throughput.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073777","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073777.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Decode-and-Forward Incremental Relaying Cooperative-Diversity Networks over Rayleigh Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Decode-and-Forward Incremental Relaying Cooperative-Diversity Networks over Rayleigh Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073777/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704128","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073777/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Decode-and-Forward Incremental Relaying Cooperative-Diversity Networks over Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-20-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068736S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073781,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanyuan Ma","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37533401600"},{"name":"Matthias Patzold","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Patzold","id":"37268363500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073781","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Wideband","Analytical models","Error probability","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","OFDM","Computational modeling","Scattering","Fading","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential phase shift keying","error statistics","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","wideband sum-of-cisoids","channel simulators","bit error probability","DPSK","OFDM systems","method of exact Doppler spread","Monte Carlo method"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the performance of a wideband sum-of-cisoids (SOC) channel simulator w.r.t. the bit error probability (BEP) of differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

We also study the degradations of the BEP introduced by an imperfect channel simulator. Using the deviation of the BEP as an appropriate measure, we evaluate the performance of three parameter computation methods, known as the method of exact Doppler spread (MEDS), the randomized MEDS (R-MEDS), and the Monte Carlo method (MCM). For coherent DPSK OFDM systems, it turns out that these three methods are equivalent. For noncoherent DPSK OFDM systems, it is theoretically shown that both the MEDS and the R-MEDS outperform the MCM.

In our study, one single transmit antenna with an aim to maximizing the total received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected for transmission, while it is assumed that the receive side use all the available antennas. Using binary-phase-shift-keying (BPSK) modulation as an illustration, we derive the exact bit error rates (BERs) of two diversity schemes, namely transmit antenna selection and full complexity schemes. Moreover, we compare the asymptotic performance of the two diversity schemes analytically. The effect of correlation among the sub-channels on the SNR degradation is also determined in terms of the correlation coefficient and the number of transmit/receive antennas. Finally, results show that the transmit antenna selection scheme can achieve better performance than the full complexity scheme at the expense of a small amount of feedback information from the receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073789.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of MIMO Systems with Transmit Antenna Selection over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Fading","Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Binary phase shift keying","Bit error rate","Performance analysis","Degradation","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","single transmit antenna selection","Rayleigh fading channel","intra-class correlated channel","signal-to-noise ratio","binary-phase-shift-keying","BPSK modulation","bit error rate","BER","asymptotic performance","diversity schemes","SNR","correlation coefficient"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of MIMO Systems with Transmit Antenna Selection over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073789/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704158","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of MIMO Systems with Transmit Antenna Selection over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-11-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045561S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073792,"authors":[{"name":"Kiattisak Maichalernnukul","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, University of Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Kiattisak","lastName":"Maichalernnukul","id":"37284823800"},{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, University of Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37269768700"},{"name":"Feng Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, University of Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37269765900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073792","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Ultra wideband antennas","Antennas and propagation","Power system relaying","Fingers","Bit error rate","Ultra wideband technology","Diversity reception","RAKE receivers","FCC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","computational complexity","diversity reception","personal area networks","probability","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB relay system","multiple antennas","IEEE 802.15.3a channel","legacy wireless systems","transmit power spectral density","ultrawideband impulse radio systems","multiple detect-and-forward relays","spatial diversity reception","partial-Rake scheme","partial pre-Rake scheme","outage probability","wireless personal area networks"]}],"abstract":"In order to coexist with existing legacy wireless systems, the transmit power spectral density (PSD) of ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radio systems is limited. The coverage range of the UWB systems is then confined within a few meters. One possible way to achieve a greater coverage is a short-range multihop relaying strategy. This paper proposes a two-hop UWB relay system using multiple detect-and-forward relays, each of which is equipped with multiple antennas. Each multiple-antenna relay performs spatial diversity reception with partial-Rake scheme in the first hop, and decides whether or not to perform spatial transmit diversity with partial-pre-Rake scheme in the second hop. This leads not only to low complexity at the receiver, but also to reduced error propagation. Moreover, we derive the outage probability of the proposed relay system based on the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model. The effects of using multiple relay antennas, relays, and Rake/pre-Rake fingers on the outage performance are demonstrated. The tradeoffs among the numbers of relay antennas, relays, and Rake/pre-Rake fingers are also investigated. Numerical results show that it is best to use multiple relay antennas to improve the outage performance of the proposed system. Furthermore, in general, increasing the number of relays is more beneficial than increasing the number of Rake/pre-Rake fingers.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073792","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073792.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Investigation of a UWB Relay System using Multiple Relays with Multiple Antennas in IEEE 802.15.3a Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073792/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Investigation of a UWB Relay System using Multiple Relays with Multiple Antennas in IEEE 802.15.3a Channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704161","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073792/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Investigation of a UWB Relay System using Multiple Relays with Multiple Antennas in IEEE 802.15.3a Channel","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-19-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08255S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073794,"authors":[{"name":"Amr Eid","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Amr","lastName":"Eid","id":"37710699900"},{"name":"Walaa Hamouda","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Walaa","lastName":"Hamouda","id":"37266360300"},{"name":"Iyad Dayoub","affiliation":["IEMN DOAE, University of Valenciennes, Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Iyad","lastName":"Dayoub","id":"37573108600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073794","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Frequency-selective fading channels","Performance analysis","Frequency","Interference suppression","Cooperative systems","Decorrelation","Detectors","Relays","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","code division multiple access","decoding","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","frequency selective surfaces","interference suppression","multipath channels","radiofrequency interference","signal detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DAF cooperative CDMA network","decode-and-forward network","frequency-selective fading slow channel","asynchronous direct sequence code-division-multiple-access","cooperative diversity","inter-user channel","bit-error-rate performance","uplink transmission","decorrelator detector","multipath fading effect","multiple-access interference mitigation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the performance of cooperative networks introduced in the literature is analyzed for asynchronous direct sequence code-division-multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems in frequency-selective slow fading environment.

We conclude by observing that for a fixed target rate and operating SNR, using a larger number of antennas and with a simple linear MMSE receiver may be a convenient design choice compared to limiting the number of antennas and insisting on more complicated non-linear receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of MMSE MIMO Receivers: A Large N Analysis for Correlated Channels","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073796","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073796.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of MMSE MIMO Receivers: A Large N Analysis for Correlated Channels","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073796/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704165","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of MMSE MIMO Receivers: A Large N Analysis for Correlated Channels","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"05-06-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067938S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073802,"authors":[{"name":"Jungwook Wee","affiliation":["Advanced Mobile Technology Research Center, Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jungwook","lastName":"Wee","id":"37554357100"},{"name":"Wongi Jeon","affiliation":["Advanced Mobile Technology Research Center, Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wongi","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37408248100"},{"name":"Younsung Lee","affiliation":["Advanced Mobile Technology Research Center, Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Younsung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37560079100"},{"name":"Kiwon Kwon","affiliation":["Advanced Mobile Technology Research Center, Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kiwon","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37309211500"},{"name":"Yongsoo Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongsoo","lastName":"Cho","id":"37290880800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073802","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073802","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an efficient estimation technique for time-varying multipath channels by exploiting two dimensional delay-time nature in pilot inserted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

However, it makes channel estimation more difficulty due to the increased frequency selectivity. In this paper, we focus on the direct estimation of the equivalent single-input channel for CDD-OFDM systems. We first propose a cyclic cross-correlation channel estimation scheme based on the equispaced constant-modulus pilot structure. Using the statistical parameters of the channel and noise derived by the result of the cyclic cross-correlation channel estimation, we propose an improved channel estimation scheme based on the Wiener filter to reduce the estimation error further.

Distinct waves are isolated and the polarization of each wave is expressed in terms of its spherical components. The evolution of the waves polarization is investigated as function of its physical propagation parameters. The polarization of the waves is shown to be sensitive to spatial characteristics, while being insensitive to delay.

For both types, appropriate performance indices are specified. A terminal pays in proportion to its fraction of the total power at the receiver, which directly determines its signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), and hence its performance. Hence, a terminal can individually choose its optimal power fraction without knowing the choices made by others. The network sets for each terminal an individual price that drives the terminal to the \"revenue per Watt\" maximiser. An optimal link-layer configuration can be identified through this analysis. Distinguishing features of our model are: (i) the simultaneous consideration of both limited and unlimited energy supplies, (ii) the performance metrics utilised (one for each type of energy supply), (iii) the generality of our physical model, and (iv) our focus on the fraction of total power at the receiver allocated to a terminal.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073811.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation through Revenue-Maximising Pricing on a CDMA Reverse Link Shared by Energy-Constrained and Energy-Sufficient Heterogeneous Data Terminals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Multiaccess communication","Energy management","Performance gain","Measurement","Base stations","Bandwidth","Gaussian noise","Batteries","Bismuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","code division multiple access","CDMA reverse link","heterogeneous data terminals","market-oriented management","link-layer configuration","power fraction","signal-to-interference ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation through Revenue-Maximising Pricing on a CDMA Reverse Link Shared by Energy-Constrained and Energy-Sufficient Heterogeneous Data Terminals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073811/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704195","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation through Revenue-Maximising Pricing on a CDMA Reverse Link Shared by Energy-Constrained and Energy-Sufficient Heterogeneous Data Terminals","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-18-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075326S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073813,"authors":[{"name":"Milan Zivkovic","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Zivkovic","id":"37392230400"},{"name":"Rudolf Mathar","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Mathar","id":"37271899400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073813","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":788},"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) offers high data rates and robust performance in frequency selective channels by link adaptation utilizing information about the channel quality. A crucial parameter required for adaptive transmission is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a novel SNR estimation algorithm for wireless OFDM systems based on the reuse of the synchronization preamble. The periodic structure of the preamble is utilized for the computationally efficient SNR estimation algorithm, based on the second-order moments of received preamble samples. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the MMSE algorithm and two preamble-based algorithms found in the literature. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is robust against frequency selectivity and may therefore be used for subchannel SNR estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073813.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preamble-Based SNR Estimation in Frequency Selective Channels for Wireless OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency synchronization","Robustness","Bandwidth","AWGN","OFDM modulation","Intersymbol interference","Additive white noise","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency selective surfaces","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preamble-based SNR estimation algorithm","frequency selective channel quality","wireless OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","link adaptation","signal-to-noise ratio","periodic structure","synchronization preamble reuse","second-order moments","subchannel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Preamble-Based SNR Estimation in Frequency Selective Channels for Wireless OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073813/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704196","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preamble-Based SNR Estimation in Frequency Selective Channels for Wireless OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-14-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050985S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5073819,"authors":[{"name":"Miha Smolnikar","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Miha","lastName":"Smolnikar","id":"37689359600"},{"name":"Mihael Mohorcic","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Mihael","lastName":"Mohorcic","id":"37298511400"},{"name":"Tomaz Javornik","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Tomaz","lastName":"Javornik","id":"37283530400"},{"name":"David Grace","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Grace","id":"37269106100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073819","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Electronic countermeasures","Statistics","Rail transportation","Attenuation","Satellite communication","Propagation delay","Wireless communication","Hybrid power systems","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric electromagnetic wave propagation","high altitude stratospheric platforms","mobile radio","quality of service","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["propagation impairment countermeasures","mobile stratospheric operating environment","high altitude platform","IP architecture","quality of service"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073819","abstract":"The efficiency of wireless communication systems largely depends on proper understanding of propagation impairments and the design of suitable countermeasures, taking into account physical causes and time-scales of propagation phenomena.

By incorporating co-existing primary system(s) and CRs into a cognitive radio network (CRN), it is possible to significantly enhance overall spectrum efficiency, provided that CRs can precisely explore appropriate spectrum and network activities, which we call CRN tomography by borrowing the terminology from medical imaging. CRN tomography can actively or passively measure or infer CRN parameters and traffic patterns. Conventional CR spectrum sensing to find the spectrum holes falls into a simplified scenario of passive CRN tomography. Like medical tomography, we propose active CRN tomography by a realistic probing signal with cooperative adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) according to SINR. We successfully demonstrate that the active radio resource tomography can support real-time adaptation to dynamic environments without any a priori information from radio channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10718116","htmlLink":"/document/5073824/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Radio Resource Tomography of Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio Resource Tomography of Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-06-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05758S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073826,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Saadani","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Saadani","id":"37268236000"},{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Landre","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Landre","id":"37391883000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073826","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Throughput","Testing","Equalizers","Modulation coding","RAKE receivers","Downlink","Base stations","Fading","Multiple access interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","least mean squares methods","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","macro-cell environment","HSDPA system","coding schemes","link level simulations","drive test measurements","LMMSE equalizer","receiver diversity"]}],"abstract":"The HSDPA system evolution introduces new modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) that use 64 QAM modulation in order to increase the maximum achievable throughput.

Specifically, a reliability-aided MUD scheme is proposed, which consists of a linear MUD and a so-called L-level maximum-likelihood (ML)-MUD. The linear MUD is either a joint TF-domain linear MUD or constituted by two linear MUDs, one of which is operated in the T-domain and the other one in the F-domain. The L-level ML-MUD is a reduced ML-MUD, which only searches in a space of size 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</sup>\n in order to find the optimum solutions for the L most unreliable data bits detected by the linear MUD. In this contribution the bit error rate (BER) performance of the TF/MC DS-CDMA using the reliability-aided MUD is investigated, when communicating over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels or over frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Our simulation results show that the reliability-aided MUD is capable of significantly outperforming the corresponding linear MUD. It can be shown that, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high, the reliability-aided MUD can readily obtain several decibels of SNR gain over the linear MUD at the cost of slight or moderate increase of the detection complexity.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073833","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073833.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability-Aided Multiuser Detection in Time-Frequency-Domain Spread Multicarrier DS-CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073833/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-Aided Multiuser Detection in Time-Frequency-Domain Spread Multicarrier DS-CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10704222","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073833/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-Aided Multiuser Detection in Time-Frequency-Domain Spread Multicarrier DS-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-12-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125534S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073835,"authors":[{"name":"Hyundoo Jeong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyundoo","lastName":"Jeong","id":"38258806800"},{"name":"Jae Hong Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Hong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336646300"},{"name":"Hanbyul Seo","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Group, Mobile Communication Technology Research Laboratory, LG Electronics, Inc., South Korea"],"firstName":"Hanbyul","lastName":"Seo","id":"37593688900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073835","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"abstract":"In this paper, a new subcarrier allocation algorithm is proposed for an uplink multiuser OFDM relay network. To achieve fairness for a source and relay, we consider the minimum rate requirement for a source and the power constraint on a relay, respectively. An optimization problem with fairness constraints is formulated and the subcarrier allocation criterion is obtained by using convex optimization. In the proposed algorithm, if all sources meet the minimum rate requirement, a subcarrier is allocated to a source-relay pair which has the largest instantaneous rate to maximize the sum of the achievable rate of a source. Otherwise, a subcarrier is allocated to a source-relay pair which has the smallest achievable rate to improve fairness for a source. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves fairness and spectral efficiency for a source.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073835.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Uplink Multiuser OFDM Relay Networks with Fairness Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Relays","Constraint optimization","MIMO","Wireless communication","Power system relaying","Computational complexity","Mobile communication","Communications technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radio networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","uplink multiuser OFDM relay networks","fairness constraints","subcarrier allocation","optimization problem","convex optimization","source relay pair"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Uplink Multiuser OFDM Relay Networks with Fairness Constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073835/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718121","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Uplink Multiuser OFDM Relay Networks with Fairness Constraints","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-14-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063144S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5073836,"authors":[{"name":"Susana Mota","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics / Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Susana","lastName":"Mota","id":"37338078900"},{"name":"Nuno Almeida","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics / Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Almeida","id":"38181659200"},{"name":"Armando Rocha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics / Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Armando","lastName":"Rocha","id":"37328974500"},{"name":"Fernando Perez-Fontan","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Perez-Fontan","id":"38274302000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073836","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"abstract":"This paper presents some results obtained from a first approach to a point-scatter simulator for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radio channel modeling.

In the presence of co-channel interference (CCI), conventional soft decision decoding is performed by a simple erasing method for frequency selective CCI. But the conventional method cannot obtain sufficient performance gain because the CCI power varies and a considerable number of bits are affected by the CCI. For this reason, we consider a novel weighting method based on the specific CSI such as statistical location and instantaneous power of the CCI as well as typical frequency-selective fading channel. Simulation results verify that the proposed CSI estimation is sufficiently reliable for digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T) system with analog TV signals as the CCI. In addition, the proposed soft decision method guarantees superior coded bit error rate (BER) performance compared to the conventional method.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073839","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073839.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust CSI-Based Soft Decision for COFDM Systems with Co-Channel Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust CSI-Based Soft Decision for COFDM Systems with Co-Channel Interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073839/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718137","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073839/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust CSI-Based Soft Decision for COFDM Systems with Co-Channel Interference","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-14-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054084S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5073843,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Meucci","affiliation":["Universit\u00e1 di Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Meucci","id":"37568183400"},{"name":"Satya Ardhy Wardana","affiliation":["Center for TeleInfrastruktur Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Satya Ardhy","lastName":"Wardana","id":"37645957500"},{"name":"Neeli Rashmi Prasad","affiliation":["Center for TeleInfrastruktur Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Neeli Rashmi","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37302205700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073843","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Physical layer","Cryptography","OFDM","Protection","Information security","Robustness","Data security","Cognitive radio","Pattern analysis","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cryptography","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical layer security","dynamic subcarrier permutations","cognitive OFDMA systems","cognitive radio network","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","dynamic spectrum access","robust protection","pattern analysis","cryptography techniques","IEEE 802.16 system model","orthogonal frequency division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel lightweight mechanism for a secure physical (PHY) layer in cognitive radio network (CRN) using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). User's data symbols are mapped over the physical subcarriers with a permutation formula. The PHY layer is secured with a random and dynamic subcarrier permutation which is based on a single pre-shared information and depends on dynamic spectrum access (DSA). The dynamic subcarrier permutation is varying over time, geographical location and environment status, resulting in a very robust protection that ensures confidentiality. The method is shown to be effective also for existing non-cognitive systems. The proposed mechanism is effective against eavesdropping even if the eavesdropper adopts a long-time patterns analysis, thus protecting cryptography techniques of higher layers. The correlation properties of the permutations are analyzed for several DSA patterns. Simulations are performed according to the parameters of the IEEE 802.16e system model. The securing mechanism proposed provides intrinsic PHY layer security and it can be easily implemented in the current IEEE 802.16 standard applying almost negligible modifications.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073843","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073843.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Physical Layer using Dynamic Permutations in Cognitive OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure Physical Layer using Dynamic Permutations in Cognitive OFDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073843/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718141","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073843/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Physical Layer using Dynamic Permutations in Cognitive OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"10-02-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060228S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5073845,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Woo Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Woo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37539892900"},{"name":"Chung G.

In this paper the smashed filter of Davenport et al. is applied to a principal problem of digital communications: pilot-based time offset and frequency offset estimation. An application, motivated by current cognitive radio research, is wide-band detection of a narrowband signal, e.g. to synchronize terminals without prior channel or frequency allocation. Smashed filter estimation and maximum likelihood-based, uncompressed estimation for a signal corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (matched filter estimation) are compared. Smashed Filtering adds a degree of freedom to signal detection and estimation problems, which effectively allows to trade signal-to-noise ratio against processing bandwidth for arbitrary signals.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073847.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Detection for Cognitive Radios with Smashed Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073847/","displayDocTitle":"Signal Detection for Cognitive Radios with Smashed Filtering","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718145","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Detection for Cognitive Radios with Smashed Filtering","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-02-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043834S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073848,"authors":[{"name":"Yoona Oh","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea","Platform Laboratory, KT Corporation, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoona","lastName":"Oh","id":"37066204500"},{"name":"Sang-Wook Han","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea","Department of ECE, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sang-Wook","lastName":"Han","id":"37404243500"},{"name":"Hoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Incheon, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280358800"},{"name":"Youngnam Han","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngnam","lastName":"Han","id":"37280849300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073848","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Resource management","Throughput","Power engineering and energy","OFDM","Transmitters","Power system modeling","Laboratories","Channel state information","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer optimization","power allocation","MIMO-OFDM systems","multiple-input multiple-output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","conventional waterfilling algorithm","complexity problem","convex analysis","successive waterfilling algorithm","perfect channel state information","transmitter","receiver"]}],"abstract":"This paper suggests an efficient power allocation scheme for multiple input and multiple output - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems achieving near-optimum. We deal with power allocation problem with low complexity. It is well known that the conventional waterfilling algorithm runs repetitive calculations and logarithm operations to find out an optimal water level over whole time and spatial dimensions. To cope with this complexity problem, we investigate the problem structure originated from the characteristic of optimal waterfilling in MIMO-OFDM system through convex analysis, which leads to a unique step structure for optimal power allocation. Taking advantage of this structure, we propose a successive waterfilling algorithm with low complexity. The proposed algorithm calculates the allocated power of each subchannel recursively after setting an initial power by the step structure. Underlying assumption is that the perfect channel state information is available to both transmitter and receiver sides.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073848","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073848.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Cross-Layer Optimization for Power Allocation in MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Cross-Layer Optimization for Power Allocation in MIMO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073848/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718146","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073848/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Cross-Layer Optimization for Power Allocation in MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"09-06-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104207S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5073849,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292384500"},{"name":"Kewu Peng","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kewu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37274592000"},{"name":"Jintao Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jintao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539000300"},{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Song","id":"37290858000"},{"name":"Zhixing Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhixing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280277800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073849","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073849","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","System performance","Frequency diversity","Fading","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Channel state information","Frequency estimation","Frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","time-varying channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision directed channel estimation","OFDM system","transmit diversity","frequency-selective fading channels","time-selective fading channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","transmit antennas","channel state information","channel sounding signal","channel frequency response","m-QAM constellation subcarriers","slow-varying fading channel"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve the system performance over both frequency- and time-selective fading channels, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with transmit diversity technique is an effective and attractive solution. However, the received signal is the superposition of the signals from different transmit antennas. Hence, to obtain accurate channel state information (CSI) is difficult but very important to recover transmitted OFDM symbols. Conventional channel estimation methods use subcarrier pilots or training sequences as the channel sounding signal to obtain the estimation of channel frequency response (CFR). Actually, decision-directed channel estimation (DDCE) method which takes advantage of the fact that m-QAM constellation subcarriers in OFDM symbol also contain much valuable hidden-information and can be used to perform the channel estimation as well as tracking of time-varying channel. In this paper, a simple and effective partial hard decision method for m-QAM is investigated. Furthermore, a simplified DDCE method based on an accurate initial CFR and partial decision results of OFDM subcarriers for transmit diversity system is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm works well over the slow-varying frequency-selective fading channel.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073849","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073849.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Decision-Directed Channel Estimation Method for OFDM System with Transmit Diversity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Decision-Directed Channel Estimation Method for OFDM System with Transmit Diversity","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5073849/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718147","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073849/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Decision-Directed Channel Estimation Method for OFDM System with Transmit Diversity","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-22-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069589S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073850,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Han","affiliation":["Key Laboratory, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Han","id":"37877123100"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Tao","affiliation":["Wireless Technol.

This approach is based on post-processing signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of each user, and takes both large scale and small scale fading into account, which renders more spatial multi-user diversity than that of the traditional paring criterions. To simplify the method, a parameter D is constructed from each user's raw SNR and channel matrix H. As shown in the simulation results, the average system transmission rate obtained by the proposed simplified SINR-based pairing scheduling (SSINRPS) is obviously larger than that of traditional strategies such as random pairing scheduling (RPS), determinant pairing scheduling (DPS) and SINR-based pairing scheduling as the optimal one.

To solve the challenge of spectrum shortage, an innovative opportunistic spectrum access strategy, called cognitive radio (CR) has been proposed.

Herein another potential candidate for CR, OFDM offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OFDM/OQAM) is introduced, and its spectral efficiency for coded multicarrier transmission is compared with cyclic prefix based OFDM (CP-OFDM) and raised cosine windowed OFDM (RC-OFDM) in CR context. Simulated results of spectral efficiency comparison (SEC) for different multicarrier systems are interpreted by theoretically analyzing the out-of-band radiation of their prototype pulses shaping.

The two-way relaying protocol can enhance the spectral efficiency compared with the one-way protocol by compensating the loss from half-duplex signaling. In this paper, we propose an iterative scheme to find a relay weighting matrix maximizing the sum-rate for two-way relay channels. Due to the non-convexity of the given problem, the proposed scheme iteratively identifies a local optimal solution by deriving the gradient of the sum-rate and applying the gradient descent algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed iterative scheme with provable convergence achieves a near-optimal sum- rate for the two-way MIMO relay channels.

Complexity reduction is achieved by using a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based BP algorithm. Parity-check matrix adaptation based on the reliability of the codeword symbols is an essential step to make the BP algorithm effective on high-density parity-check matrices characteristic of RS codes. The matrix adaptation, as well as all other operations, is performed at symbol level such that bit-to-symbol and symbol-to- bit conversions are avoided. A moderate coding gain over algebraic hard-decision decoding is achieved on additive white Gaussian noise channels. The symbol-based algorithm presented in this paper addresses the main weakness of its bit-based counterpart, namely the prohibitively high complexity for practical applications that use long codes and large finite fields, albeit with less coding gain.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073872","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073872.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Belief propagation","Reed-Solomon codes","Iterative algorithms","Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Additive white noise","Sparse matrices","AWGN","Code standards","FAA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","AWGN channels","Bayes methods","decoding","fast Fourier transforms","matrix algebra","parity check codes","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol-based belief propagation decoding","Reed-Solomon code","fast Fourier transform","FFT-based BP algorithm","parity-check matrix adaptation","additive white Gaussian noise channel","algebraic hard-decision decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Symbol-Based Belief Propagation Decoding of Reed-Solomon Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073872/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073872/","accessionNumber":"10718189","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol-Based Belief Propagation Decoding of Reed-Solomon Codes","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-02-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054574S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073876,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Bernardo","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Bernardo","id":"37394379100"},{"name":"Ramon Agusti","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Agusti","id":"37268326200"},{"name":"J.

In this paper, an self-learning spectrum sensing framework is proposed, which can enable the single mobile cognitive node to work in unknown wireless environment. When the wireless environment changes, the main sensing parameters (such as decision threshold, sampling frequency) could be adapted to optimum in the self- earning process. One adaptive algorithm is proposed to find the optimal decision threshold in energy detection sensing method.

Power control via channel inversion is common practice in the uplink of cellular systems as it maintains constant received signal power at the controlling base station (BS) regardless of the position of the mobile station (MS). Unlike the conventional cellular system, CBSs share information in detecting the MSs and they are shown to increase the system capacity. We propose a power control approach based on sustaining the total received power in CBSs. We investigate the performance of this method through simulations and show that it reduces the intercell interference in the CBS systems, saves power and improves the BER performance in both coded and uncoded scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073887","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073887.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total Power Control for Cooperative Base Stations Uplink","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073887/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Total Power Control for Cooperative Base Stations Uplink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073887/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10718224","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total Power Control for Cooperative Base Stations Uplink","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"10-03-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047044S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5073892,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292384500"},{"name":"Kewu Peng","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kewu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37274592000"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292907900"},{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Song","id":"37290858000"},{"name":"Zhixing Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhixing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280277800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2517-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"5073892","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Digital video broadcasting","OFDM","Fading","Frequency division multiplexing","Delay estimation","Bandwidth","Wireless LAN","Digital TV","Multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","computational complexity","diversity reception","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","pseudonoise codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit diversity","channel estimation","time domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","TDS-OFDM system","wireless fading channel","PN sequence design","space-time block coded m-sequences","Doppler spread","delay spread","fast Fourier transforms","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve the system performance over wireless fading channel, transmit diversity technique has been proven as an attractive and effective solution especially for broadcasting systems.

Based on this novel design, flexible channel estimation which provides a trade-off between maximum delay spread and maximum Doppler spread over double-selective channel is investigated and a radix-2 fast Fourier transform (FFT) approach is adopted for implementation from the viewpoint of computational complexity.

Iterative approaches based on Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC) and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) are investigated, and a low-complexity solution allowing to combine interstream interference cancellation and noise enhancement reduction is proposed. Performance is evaluated for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiplexing (SC-FDM) as candidate uplink modulation schemes for LTE-A. Simulation results show that, in a 2times2 antenna configuration, the turbo processing allows a consistent improvement of the link performance, being SC-FDM the one having higher relative gain with respect to linear detection. The turbo receiver's impact is however much reduced for both modulation schemes in a 2times4 configuration, due to the higher diversity gain provided by the additional receive antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073893.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo Receivers for Single User MIMO LTE-A Uplink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference cancellation","Long Term Evolution","Iterative methods","Silicon carbide","Noise reduction","Noise cancellation","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM modulation","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo receivers","MIMO","long term evolution-advanced systems","turbo detection techniques","single user multiple-input-multiple-output antenna schemes","parallel interference cancellation","successive interference cancellation","noise enhancement reduction","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","single carrier frequency division multiplexing","receive antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Turbo Receivers for Single User MIMO LTE-A Uplink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073893/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718230","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo Receivers for Single User MIMO LTE-A Uplink","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"06-07-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054974S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073897,"authors":[{"name":"Luis A.

In this paper, a semi-blind user separation algorithm is proposed, which assumes time synchronization and availability of information on the type of SAS used. The proposed algorithm estimates the carrier frequency offsets and time delays of each frequency allocation block by exploiting the cross-correlations over pilot subcarriers. A clustering method to group the blocks is employed, where each group belongs to a different user. Mathematical model of the proposed algorithm is presented, and possible user separation applications in OFDMA-based femtocells are discussed. Feasibility of the algorithm is proved through practical simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073271/5073272/05073898.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Separation for OFDMA Uplink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Synthetic aperture sonar","Frequency estimation","Radio spectrum management","Frequency conversion","Frequency synchronization","Delay estimation","Delay effects","Clustering methods","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA uplink","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system","subcarrier assignment scheme","semiblind user separation algorithm","time synchronization","carrier frequency offset estimation","time delay estimation","frequency allocation block","mathematical model","OFDMA-based femtocells"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"User Separation for OFDMA Uplink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10718265","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Separation for OFDMA Uplink","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"03-05-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057369S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073271","isNumber":"5073272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073272","articleId":"5073898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073929,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ajmal Khan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muhammad Ajmal","lastName":"Khan","id":"37653385100"},{"name":"Muhammad Moinuddin","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Moinuddin","id":"37594078200"},{"name":"Samir Al-Ghadhban","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Al-Ghadhban","id":"38273969100"},{"name":"Asrar U.

In the subspace based channel shortening, the convolutive system is transformed into instantaneous system thorough successive deflations and can end up to different memoryless systems corresponding to nonzero taps of MIMO channel. However, only one of the memoryless systems is exploited to separate the mixtures by the independent component analysis (ICA) method. In this system we improved the performance by taking advantage of using all the memoryless systems in the estimation of the mixtures. In fact the mixtures are estimated separately based on each evaluated memoryless system and then average is taken over their results. The simulation results show considerable enhancement in performance with a price which is paid for complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of the Mosharaka International Conference on Communications, Signals and Coding","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069087/5073919/05073931.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of the Mosharaka International Conference on Communications, Signals and Coding","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073919","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind receiver based on instantaneous independent component analysis for convolutive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Independent component analysis","MIMO","Memoryless systems","Higher order statistics","Blind source separation","Fading","OFDM modulation","Transmitters","Source separation","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","convolution","independent component analysis","memoryless systems","MIMO communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind receiver","independent component analysis","ICA","convolutive MIMO channel","multiple input multiple output system","blind source separation","subspace based channel shortening","memoryless system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind receiver based on instantaneous independent component analysis for convolutive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5073931/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10703177","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind receiver based on instantaneous independent component analysis for convolutive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"Paper 5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042901S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5069087","isNumber":"5073919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069087","xplore-issue":"5073919","articleId":"5073931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Mosharaka for Researches","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5073936,"authors":[{"name":"I.

We consider the forward transmission case where different classes of data are simultaneously transmitted for different active users. The system allocates different data streams over different subchannels or blocks according to the each user's CSI, and assigns to each stream a priority grade according to the QoS experienced and needed by each user. The classical water-filling algorithm is here adapted to cope with the spreading codes and the bit allocation. Results show that the total data rate gets closer to the channel capacity while the QoS requirements are met.","publicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of the Mosharaka International Conference on Communications, Signals and Coding","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Proceedings of the Mosharaka International Conference on Communications, Signals and Coding","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069087/5073919/05073936.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073919","startPage":"47","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subchannel power allocation and rate adaptation for a MC-CDMA system satisfying mixed QoS requirements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5073936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subchannel power allocation and rate adaptation for a MC-CDMA system satisfying mixed QoS requirements","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5073936/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10703182","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subchannel power allocation and rate adaptation for a MC-CDMA system satisfying mixed QoS requirements","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"Paper 10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067647S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2008","isNumber":"5073919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069087","articleId":"5073936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5073960,"authors":[{"name":"Phatiphat Thounthong","affiliation":["King Mongkut's University of Technology, North Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Phatiphat","lastName":"Thounthong","id":"37400042100"},{"name":"Bernard Davat","affiliation":["Nancy Universit\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Davat","id":"37282679400"},{"name":"Stephane Rael","affiliation":["Nancy Universit\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Rael","id":"37282680000"},{"name":"Panarit Sethakul","affiliation":["King Mongkut's University of Technology, North Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Panarit","lastName":"Sethakul","id":"37541309500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2618"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0598"}],"articleNumber":"5073960","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"abstract":"The most important purpose of this work is to analyze the phenomenon of a fuel starvation of a PEM FC system. The incentive for automotive FC applications is quite different from that for stationary power generation or other applications. The dynamic characteristics of FC must be considered. Experimental results based on a PEMFC (500 W, 40 A) noticeably substantiate that, to employ an FC in dynamic applications, its current or power slope must be limited to improve an FC performance, including its voltage-current curve and lifetime. The use of other kinds of auxiliary power source(s) as depicted in the paper, such as batteries or supercapacitors to cooperate with FC main source, is mandatory for high dynamic applications,

Wiring length can be reduced and integration density can be increased by stacking different assembled substrate layers and interconnecting them with one another resulting in 3D-SiP. Glass is an excellent material because of matched coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) to silicon, high thermal load, dielectricity and high optical transparency over a wide wavelength range. Commercially available thin glass foils can be used as substrate material for electronic and optoelectronic modules. The goal of our ongoing development is making glass based packaging competitive with polymer based (e.g. chip-in-polymer) or silicon based packaging (e.g. silicon-through-via, stacked dies by wire bonding). Our work is focused on conductor trace and through-via realization as well as optical lightwave circuits integration using glass as substrate material. For through-vias in glass, holes were drilled in glass wafers by different laser technologies or etched using photosensitive glass and evaluated. Conductor traces and through-via interconnects were deposited on glass. Also, optical waveguide and fluidic channel integration in glass substrates were investigated. This paper presents the first demonstrator of our glass based packaging technology targeting sensor applications. Two silicon dies, a laser diode, two photodiodes and a fluidic-optical chip were mounted on a glass substrate and interconnected by 3D electrical wiring.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thin glass based packaging technologies for optoelectronic modules","publicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074018","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066986/5073977/05074018.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Thin glass based packaging technologies for optoelectronic modules","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074018/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10702839","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin glass based packaging technologies for optoelectronic modules","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s05p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064061S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066986","isNumber":"5073977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066986","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5073977","articleId":"5074018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5074032,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaowu Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaowu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279343900"},{"name":"T.C.

Thus, the conventional organic buildup substrates cannot support these kinds of silicon chips anymore. To address these needs, Si interposer with TSV has emerged as a good solution to provide high wiring density interconnection, to minimize CTE mismatch to the Cu/low-k chip that is vulnerable to thermal-mechanical stress, and to improve electrical performance due to shorter interconnection from the chip to the substrate. This paper presents the development of TSV interposer technology for a 21 times 21 mm Cu/low-k test chip on FCBGA package. The Cu/low-k chip is a 65 nm, 9-metal layer chip with 150 mum SnAg bump pitch of total 11,000 I/O, with via chain and daisy chain for interconnect integrity monitoring and reliability testing. The TSV interposer size is 25 times 25 times 0.3 mm with CuNiAu as UBM on the top side, and SnAgCu bumps on the underside. The conventional BT substrate size is 45 times 45 mm with BGA pad pitch of 1 mm and core thickness of 0.8 mm. Mechanical and thermal modeling and simulation for the FCBGA package with TSV interposer have been performed. TSV interposer fabrication processes and assembly process of the large die mounted on TSV interposer with Pb-free micro solder bumps and underfill have been set up. The FCBGA samples have been subjected to moisture sensitivity test and thermal cycling (TC) reliability assessments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074032","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074032","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology

The 3D packaging technology with through-hole electrodes has been receiving an especially great deal of attention because through-hole electrodes technology results in compact and high-performance systems. We have developed a new chip-to-chip interconnection method using mechanical caulking with through-hole electrodes and Au stud-bumps. In this method, bonding between chips is achieved by the deformation-injection of an Au stud bump on a chip into a through-hole electrode on the other chip. Therefore, electrical interconnection between stacked chips can be achieved by simply applying a pressing load at room temperature. In this study, the through-hole electrodes were formed from the backside of a wafer by via-last processing. However, fabricating through-hole electrode for existing products such as the micro-controller unit fraught with difficulty because the through-hole electrodes must be connected to external lands (aluminum electrodes for wire bonding) located on the front- side of the wafer. This requires a sufficiently long time to etch the interlayer dielectric film and etching control to stop the etching at thin aluminum electrodes. The variance of the etching rate for interlayer dielectric film often causes short- etching or over-etching of aluminum electrodes, which means electrical connecting through-hole electrodes with aluminum electrodes fail. Therefore, we had not established a high-yield through-hole electrode fabrication process. To realize the high-yield through-hole electrode fabrication in via-last processing, we developed a new electrode structure. In our proposed structure, several internal 'lands', which share the same area with the external land, are inserted into the interlayer dielectric film just below the external land. The internal lands are formed using the back- end metal layers within the interlayer dielectric film. The proposed structure with internal lands is expected to enable the production tolerance and reduce the etching time of the interlayer dielectric film. Our experimental results using a test element group wafer with internal lands reveal that the electrical connecting ratio between the through-hole electrodes and the internal lands was 100% (evaluated with five chips each having 200 connecting points distributed on a 4-inch wafer, which had 166 chips). In addition, the etching time for hole opening decreased by 54% compared with the conventional structure. The high-yield through-hole electrode fabrication enabled us to examine the transistor characteristics using through-hole electrodes. Using through-hole electrodes, 65-nm-node transistors were successfully operated. Additionally, the same transistors were operated even with two chips connected using through-hole electrodes by mechanical caulking. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between the transistor characteristics and the distance from the transistor to the through-hole electrode. In this paper, we focused on the saturation current, which is one of the important characteristics of transistors. The saturation current decreased as the distance from the through-hole electrode became smaller (especially bellow 20 mum).","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074041","startPage":"360","endPage":"364","publicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066986/5073977/05074041.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of MOS transistor after through-hole electrode fabrication and 3D-assembly by mechanical caulking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074041/","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of MOS transistor after through-hole electrode fabrication and 3D-assembly by mechanical caulking","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10702880","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074041/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of MOS transistor after through-hole electrode fabrication and 3D-assembly by mechanical caulking","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s08p6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046553S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","isNumber":"5073977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066986","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5074041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5074078,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Liu","affiliation":["Microsystems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Xi Liu","id":"37935036600"},{"name":"Qiao Chen","affiliation":["Microsystems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Qiao Chen","id":"37931644200"},{"name":"Pradeep Dixit","affiliation":["Microsystems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Pradeep Dixit","id":"37301897300"},{"name":"Ritwik Chatterjee","affiliation":["Microsystems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Ritwik Chatterjee","id":"37269211200"},{"name":"Rao R.

There has been significant effort in TSV fabrication and electrical design. However, considerably less work has been done on thermo-mechanical analysis and mechanical design of these structures. Due to the high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between Si and the conducting material in the vias, thermo-mechanical reliability is a major concern. This paper uses finite-element (FE) models and X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments for the thermo-mechanical analysis of TSVs. Two-dimensional thermo-mechanical finite-element models have been built to analyze the stress/strain distribution in the TSV structures, and the models show that large stress gradients and plastic deformation exist near the corner of electroplated Cu pads. The stress results from the finite-element models have been compared against XRD experimental data.

In this study, the thermo-mechanical reliability of 3-D interconnect was investigated using finite element analysis (FEA) combined with analytical methods. FEA simulation demonstrated that the thermal stresses in silicon decrease as a function of distance from an isolated TSV and increase with the TSV diameter. Additional simulation suggested that hybrid TSV structures can significantly reduce the thermal stresses. An analytical stress solution was introduced to deduce the stress distribution around an isolated TSV, which was further developed to deduce the stress interaction in TSV arrays based on linear superposition of the analytical solution. We calculated the crack driving force in TSV lines under a thermal load. The effects of TSV diameter, pitch size, and the line configuration on crack driving force were investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066986/5073977/05074079.pdf","startPage":"630","endPage":"634","publicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermo-mechanical reliability of 3-D ICs containing through silicon vias","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermomechanical processes","Silicon","Thermal stresses","Through-silicon vias","Copper","Residual stresses","Thermal force","Filling","Manufacturing processes","Thermal degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","finite element analysis","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit reliability","silicon","thermal stresses","thermomechanical treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermomechanical reliability","3D IC interconnect","through silicon vias","process-induced thermal stress","finite element analysis","FEA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Thermo-mechanical reliability of 3-D ICs containing through silicon vias","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074079/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10702946","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermo-mechanical reliability of 3-D ICs containing through silicon vias","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s14p2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046226S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066986","isNumber":"5073977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066986","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"5073977","articleId":"5074079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074080,"authors":[{"name":"John H.

Antenna miniaturization is also a critical issue since the key component determining the size of a mobile device is usually the antenna. Recent studies on novel materials called magneto-dielectrics have raised hope to miniaturize the antenna effectively. Magneto-dielectrics are materials with both the relative permittivity (epsi\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n) and the relative permeability (mu\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n) of the substrate greater than unity. In this paper, several issues regarding the magneto-dielectrics and their application to the antenna miniaturization are investigated. The theoretical reason why the magneto-dielectrics are better substrates for planar antennas than the dielectric materials is investigated along with a material synthesis technique to explain how to realize these materials. Additionally, a characterization methodology to extract the frequency dependent properties (epsi', epsi\" mu', and mu\") of these materials is presented in this paper. Finally, the advantages and the limitations of these substrates for antenna applications are discussed in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074103","publicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066986/5073977/05074103.pdf","startPage":"801","endPage":"808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna miniaturization using magneto-dielectric substrates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074103/","displayDocTitle":"Antenna miniaturization using magneto-dielectric substrates","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10702970","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074103/","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna miniaturization using magneto-dielectric substrates","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s17p5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132053S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066986","isNumber":"5073977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066986","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5073977","articleId":"5074103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5074112,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaobing Luo","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaobing","lastName":"Luo","id":"37288618500"},{"name":"Wei Xiong","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37692049800"},{"name":"Ting Cheng","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37690096800"},{"name":"Sheng Liu","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280143900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4475-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4476-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"}],"articleNumber":"5074112","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1135},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074112","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Heat sinks","Light emitting diodes","Temperature","Design methodology","Optimization methods","LED lamps","Thermal management","Thermal stresses","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip scale packaging","durability","heat sinks","LED lamps","semiconductor device packaging","semiconductor device reliability","street lighting","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["horizontally-located plate fin heat sink","high-power LED street lamp","light emitting diode","chip packaging","optical extraction","reliability","durability","thermal management","heat dissipation","steady state temperature","environment temperature","power 112 W","temperature 45 C","temperature 25 C"]}],"abstract":"When junction temperatures of the light emitting diode (LED) chips packaged inside LED lamps exceed their maximal limits, the optical extraction and the reliability/durability of the LED lamps will be jeopardized, therefore, thermal management is very important for high power LED street lamps.

Face-to-face silicon (Si) dies stacking is one of the three dimensional (3D) packaging technologies to form a high density module. In this work, a chip level stacked module was demonstrated for medical application and assessed its package level reliability. The chip level stack module is achieved by stacking two thin dies of different size and thickness together using flip chip technology with micro bump interconnects. Electrical simulations are carried out to obtain RLC parameters of micro bump interconnect and complete interconnection from daughter die to substrate. Mechanical simulations are also carried out to study the stress analysis on micro bumps and CSP bumps in the package and parametric study of stacked module package to study the effect of substrate material, underfill material die thicknesses on package reliability and warpage. Test chips are designed and fabricated with daisy chain test structures to access the reliability of the stack module. Pb-free (SnAg) micro bumps of 40 mum on daughter die wafers and eutectic SnPb solder CSP bumps of 200 mum height on mother die wafers are fabricated. Mother die and daughter die bumped wafers were thinned to 300 mum and 60 mum respectively using mechanical backgrinding method. These thin dies are stacked using chip to wafer flip chip bonding and underfill process is established for the micro bump interconnects. The assembled Si die stacked modules are subjected to JEDEC package level reliability tests in terms of temperature cycle test (TC), high temperature storage test (HTS), moisture sensitivity test level 1 (MST L1) and MST L3, and un-biased high accelerated stress test (uHAST) and results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074132","publicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066986/5073977/05074132.pdf","startPage":"980","endPage":"987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of 3-D silicon die stacked package using flip chip technology with micro bump interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074132/","displayDocTitle":"Development of 3-D silicon die stacked package using flip chip technology with micro bump interconnects","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10702999","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074132/","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of 3-D silicon die stacked package using flip chip technology with micro bump interconnects","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s21p6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055147S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066986","isNumber":"5073977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066986","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5073977","articleId":"5074132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074141,"authors":[{"name":"Trang Thai","affiliation":["School of ECE, GEDC, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Trang","lastName":"Thai","id":"37545551800"},{"name":"Justin Ratner","affiliation":["School of ECE, GEDC, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Ratner","id":"37295838900"},{"name":"Wenhua Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave & Digital Communication, Tsinghua University, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Wenhua Chen","id":"37279187600"},{"name":"Gerald DeJean","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"DeJean","id":"37280227900"},{"name":"Manos M.

Since carbon nanotubes were found to be ultra sensitive to different gases at extremely low concentration, a very important application is integrated gas sensors that are based on the change in the electrical properties of carbon nanotube materials induced by gas molecule adsorption. However, a systematic design methodology for high frequency gas sensors utilizing carbon nanotube materials is not yet possible due to the lack of in-depth knowledge on the material properties before and after being exposed to the gases of interests. In this study, the scattering parameters of PNM textile embedded in waveguides are measured in both room atmosphere and in ammonia/air mixture of 5% ammonia. The gas measurement show a phase shift of 10 degrees in S11 values. The impedance of the PNMs are computed from the scattering parameters in waveguide measurements, which for the first time experimentally show that CNTs can function as resonators at microwave frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074141","publicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066986/5073977/05074141.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073977","startPage":"1049","endPage":"1052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization and testing of novel polarized nanomaterial textiles for ultrasensitive wireless gas sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization and testing of novel polarized nanomaterial textiles for ultrasensitive wireless gas sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074141/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703007","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074141/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization and testing of novel polarized nanomaterial textiles for ultrasensitive wireless gas sensors","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s23p1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045182S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066986","isNumber":"5073977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066986","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5073977","articleId":"5074141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074147,"authors":[{"name":"Unsun Cho","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Unsun Cho","id":"37824443200"},{"name":"Yunho Jung","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yunho Jung","id":"37274423500"},{"name":"Shinil Lim","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Shinil Lim","id":"38184377700"},{"name":"Jaeseok Kim","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jaeseok Kim","id":"37281193800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4475-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4476-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"}],"articleNumber":"5074147","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074147","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Humans","Medical treatment","Heart","Circuits","Modems","CMOS technology","Cardiology","Energy consumption","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","defibrillators","diseases","electrocardiography","medical signal detection","mobile communication","prosthetics","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["implantable cardioverter defibrillator","mixed signal biomedical SoC","wireless communication system","heart arrhythmia","low power consumption","chip design","front-end circuit","bio-signal digital processor","modem","digital conversion-of-analog electrogram signal","real time QRS detection algorithm","CMOS technology","device miniaturization","voltage 1.5 V","size 0.18 mum"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074147","publicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066986/5073977/05074147.pdf","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implantable bio-medical SoC for ICD with wireless communication system","abstract":"This paper presents the implementation results of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) which is a mixed signal biomedical SoC implanted in human body to deliver appropriate therapies for heart arrhythmia.

With the metal temporarily bonding technology, we could remove the handling substrate and perform the chip stacking process. The TSVs made by bottom-up electroplating do not need the expensive MOCVD seed layer deposition and special designed electroplater/solution. Moreover, it is independent with the DRIE angle and the scallop at the sidewall of the vias. By using the bottom-up electroplating technology, we could fabricate the TSVs in much shorter process time to save the process cost. From the X-Ray images and the SEM pictures, the diameter of the vias is 5.3 micron meters and the length of the vias is 67 micron meters. The aspect ratio of the bottom-up electroplated TSVs is larger than 12 and all the vias are definitely void free. X-Ray image also shows the process yield is very high. After the thermal shock reliability test, the resistance measurement and the vias are fine from the SEM pictures. There is no crack found at the sidewall of the vias. After the TSV process, the bonded electrode continues to serve as electrode for the mask-less Sn electroplating. The electroplating current goes through the bottom electrode TSVs and the Sn is electroplated on the TSVs without mask define. Sn bump served as mechanical and electrical connection. We also demonstrate the dry etching process for wafer thinning on a 170degC thermal release tape with handling substrate. After the etching process, the thickness of the chip is about 5 mum and then it is released from the handling substrate successfully. For thin wafer handling technology, we proposed a metal temporarily bonding technology. Au to Au bonding is used here for metal temporarily bonding. After the wafer thinning process, the sample could sustain high temperature process without crack and could be removed from the handling substrate after the process. This study also demonstrates the process flow for the 3D chip stacking by using the bottom-up electroplated TSVs. The handling substrate is removed by metal temporarily bonding technology and the interconnection is done by Cu/Sn bump. Based on this technology, the TSVs in the 3D chip stacking could be made in shorter electroplating time and low cost way by a traditional electroplater.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074161","publicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066986/5073977/05074161.pdf","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D stacked chip technology using bottom-up electroplated TSVs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074161/","displayDocTitle":"3D stacked chip technology using bottom-up electroplated TSVs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703026","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074161/","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D stacked chip technology using bottom-up electroplated TSVs","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s25p7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084489S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066986","isNumber":"5073977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066986","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5073977","articleId":"5074161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074196,"authors":[{"name":"B.

First is the alignment between the wafers. While the alignment accuracy is about 5 mum before contacting the wafers, it becomes about 17 mum after bonding. Second are the air-gaps across the bonded interface due to processing induced artifacts and particles. Third is the wafer bow, which control the three-dimensional (3D) bonding.

This work demonstrates a novel interconnection solution with excellent reliability for ultra-fine pitch (~30 mum) silicon (Si) on organic first level interconnections by using copper (Cu) pillar with nano-anisotropic conductive film (nano-ACF)/non conductive Film (NCF). Novel nano-ACF/NCF materials were developed and evaluated for package level reliability criterion for mobile or portable electronics systems at ultra-fine first level interconnect pitch of 30 mum. Various additives were added to the formulation to enhance the reliability performance. Test vehicles (TVs) with 30 mum bump pitch were designed with 3 mm times 3 mm chip to extract both daisy chain resistance and single bump resistance data. As assembled bump resistivity was measured and the interconnect reliability performance was evaluated using the novel adhesive materials for flip-chip on organic packages. Performance of these test vehicles was studied for High Temperature Storage Life Test (HTS), Unbiased- Highly Accelerated Stress Test (U-HAST) and is currently being tested for Thermal Cycling Test (TCT). Test results showed that the interconnect resistance is better than or comparable to most common solders for both as assembled and U-HAST tested assemblies. The TVs depicted excellent reliability results in both HTS and U-HAST. Insulation resistance measurements showed that these adhesives are near perfect insulators and there is negligible difference in nano-ACF and NCF in terms of leakage current. On the basis of the results, nano-adhesive materials, proposed in this work provide unique opportunities for ultra fine pitch and high electrical performance interconnects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly-reliable, 30\u00b5m pitch copper interconnects using nano-ACF/NCF","publicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074208","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066986/5073977/05074208.pdf","startPage":"1479","endPage":"1485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Highly-reliable, 30\u00b5m pitch copper interconnects using nano-ACF/NCF","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074208/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10703072","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly-reliable, 30\u00b5m pitch copper interconnects using nano-ACF/NCF","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s32p5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109715S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066986","isNumber":"5073977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066986","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5073977","articleId":"5074208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5074233,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Bharathy","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"],"firstName":"Krishna","lastName":"Bharathy"},{"name":"Jae Young Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Jae Young","lastName":"Choi","id":"38240065900"},{"name":"Madhavan Swaminathan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Madhavan","lastName":"Swaminathan","id":"37275519500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4475-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4476-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"}],"articleNumber":"5074233","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Packaging","Geometry","Apertures","Admittance","Computational efficiency","Power supplies","Voltage fluctuations","Electromagnetic interference","Finite difference methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","mesh generation","multichip modules","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element method","multilayered power-ground planes","plane-pair geometry","SPICE-compatible equivalent circuit","admittance matrices","adaptive triangular mesh","voids"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel formulation for the modeling of multi-layer package power/ground planes has been proposed. The formulation is developed by first applying the finite element method (FEM) for a single plane-pair geometry, from which a SPICE-compatible equivalent circuit is extracted. Next, the admittance matrices obtained for individual plane-pairs are coupled together, to extend the technique, and to enable the modeling of multiple plane-pairs. This method, the mutli-layer finite element method (MFEM), uses an adaptive triangular mesh. This enables MFEM to capture the effects of small geometrical features that can affect the frequency response, with only a modest increase in computational cost as compared to methods that use regular square meshes. MFEM is able to correctly model the effect of apertures or voids in the planes, which cause vertical coupling of energy. Several examples have been shown to illustrate the efficacy of the method for both single and multiple plane-pair geometries.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074233","publicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5066986/5073977/05074233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073977","startPage":"1630","endPage":"1635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of the finite element method for the modeling of multi-layered power/ground planes with small features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Use of the finite element method for the modeling of multi-layered power/ground planes with small features","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074233/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10702768","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074233/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of the finite element method for the modeling of multi-layered power/ground planes with small features","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s36p2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103648S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5066986","isNumber":"5073977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5066986","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5073977","articleId":"5074233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074308,"authors":[{"name":"K.-C.

The goal of such adaptation methods is to provide a flexible framework that can synthesize waveforms that provide different tradeoffs between a variety of performance objectives, and can do so efficiently. In this paper, we propose a waveform design method that efficiently synthesizes waveforms that provide a trade-off between estimation performance for a Gaussian ensemble of targets and detection performance for a specific target. In particular, the method synthesizes (finite length) waveforms that achieve an inherent trade-off between the (Gaussian) mutual information and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a particular target. In addition, the method can accommodate a variety of constraints on the transmitted spectrum. We show that the waveform design problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem in the autocorrelation of the waveform, and we develop a customized interior point method for efficiently obtaining a globally optimal waveform.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal waveform design for cognitive radar","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074349","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074349.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal waveform design for cognitive radar","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074349/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718696","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal waveform design for cognitive radar","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073719S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5074354,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38275609800"},{"name":"Bhavana Manjunath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Bhavana","lastName":"Manjunath","id":"38276526800"},{"name":"Ghassan Maalouli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Ghassan","lastName":"Maalouli","id":"37281656700"},{"name":"Antonia Papandreou-Suppappola","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Antonia","lastName":"Papandreou-Suppappola","id":"38275416300"},{"name":"Darryl Morrell","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Polytechnic Campus, Arizona State University, Mesa, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Darryl","lastName":"Morrell","id":"37285057400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074354","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate waveform design for dynamic target tracking using a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) radar system.

Recently, the idea of compressed sensing has been used in the radar system. When the number of targets on the range-Doppler plane is small, the target scene can be reconstructed by employing the compressed sensing techniques. In this paper, we extend this idea to the MIMO radar. In the MIMO radar, the compressed sensing technique can be used to reconstruct the target scene when the signals are sparse in the range-Doppler-angle space. To effectively reconstruct the target scene, it is required that the correlation between the target responses be small. In this paper, a waveform design method is introduced to reduce the correlations between target responses. Because of the increased dimensionality in MIMO radars as compared to phased array radars, the impact of compressed sensing will be very significant there.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074356.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"44","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing in MIMO radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","MIMO","Layout","Doppler radar","Radar antennas","Receiving antennas","Linear antenna arrays","Spaceborne radar","Transmitting antennas","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","phased array radar","radar detection","radar receivers","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","compressed sensing","signal sampling","target reconstruction","sparse signals","range-Doppler-angle space","waveform design","phased array radars"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing in MIMO radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074356/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718703","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing in MIMO radar","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042489S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074366,"authors":[{"name":"V.

We obtain Whittle's index in closed-form under the average reward criterion, which leads to the direct implementation of Whittle's index policy. To evaluate the performance of Whittle's index policy, we provide simple algorithms to calculate an upper bound of the optimal performance. The tightness of the upper bound and the near-optimal performance of Whittle's index policy are illustrated with simulation examples. When channels are stochastically identical, we show that Whittle's index policy is equivalent to the myopic policy, which has a simple and robust structure. Based on this structure, we establish the approximation factors of the performance of Whittle's index policy. Furthermore, we show that Whittle's index policy is optimal under certain conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074369","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074369.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel probing for opportunistic access with multi-channel sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074369/","displayDocTitle":"Channel probing for opportunistic access with multi-channel sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718730","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074369/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel probing for opportunistic access with multi-channel sensing","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052759S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074370,"authors":[{"name":"Lifeng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37402804900"},{"name":"Hai Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272625900"},{"name":"H.

In the scenario under consideration, multiple cognitive users seek to opportunistically exploit the availability of empty frequency bands within parts of the radio spectrum having multiple bands. The availability of each channel is modelled as a Markov chain. The scenario in which the parameters of the Markov chain of each channel is known is first considered. An optimal symmetric strategy that maximizes the total throughput of the cognitive users is developed. Next, the situation in which the parameters of each channel are unknown a priori is considered. This problem is modelled as a competitive multiuser bandit problem, a non-trivial extension of the classical bandit problem. Low complexity medium access protocols, which strike an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation in such competitive environments, are developed. The operating points of these low complexity protocols are shown to converge to those of the scenario in which the parameters are known.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"98","endPage":"102","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074370.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medium access in cognitive radio networks: A competitive multi-armed bandit framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074370/","displayDocTitle":"Medium access in cognitive radio networks: A competitive multi-armed bandit framework","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718731","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medium access in cognitive radio networks: A competitive multi-armed bandit framework","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046843S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5074371,"authors":[{"name":"Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Jayakrishnan","lastName":"Unnikrishnan","id":"37572645200"},{"name":"Venugopal V.

This work studies a scenario in which finite-capacity unidirectional backhaul links exist only between base stations belonging to adjacent cells. Relying on a linearWyner-type cellular model with no fading, achievable rates are derived for the two scenarios in which the base stations are endowed only with the codebooks of local (in-cell) mobile stations, or also with the codebooks used in adjacent cells.

To increase the sum-rate, it has been shown that downlink channel state information (CSI) must be utilized at the transmitter. Especially in frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems, feedback of this CSI is necessary from each of the users to provide the transmitter with this knowledge. The amount of feedback should be as small as possible to reduce the uplink burden. Most work on the design of this feedback has assumed a channel that fades independently from block to block. However, in practice, the channel is correlated in time. In this paper, we propose a limited feedback approach utilizing the temporal channel correlation information in multiuser downlink MIMO systems.

Nevertheless, the performance of spatial interference cancelation can be degraded by imperfect channel estimation at receivers. We analyze the impact of inaccurate channel state information (CSI) on network transmission capacity by modeling transmitters as a Poisson point process and applying mathematical tools from stochastic geometry. CSI inaccuracy leads to smaller throughput and larger outage probability of each data link. Such performance loss can be controlled by choosing the length of training sequences as derived. Furthermore, increasing this length logarithmically with the inverse of the decreasing target outage probability achieves the same network-capacity scaling laws as for perfect CSI. Simulation results show that spatial interference cancelation increases transmission capacity by an order of magnitude or more despite CSI inaccuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074377","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074377.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"131","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial interference cancelation for mobile ad hoc networks: Imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial interference cancelation for mobile ad hoc networks: Imperfect CSI","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074377/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718737","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074377/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial interference cancelation for mobile ad hoc networks: Imperfect CSI","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088653S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074378,"authors":[{"name":"Hooman Shirani-Mehr","affiliation":["EE Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hooman","lastName":"Shirani-Mehr","id":"38274924500"},{"name":"Daniel N.

Users estimate their channel vectors from common downlink pilot symbols and feed back a prediction, which is used by the BS to compute the linear beamforming matrix for the next time slot and to select the users to be served according to the proportional fair scheduling (PFS) algorithm. We consider a realistic physical channel model used as a benchmark in standardization and some alternatives for the channel estimation and prediction scheme. We show that a parametric method based on ESPRIT is able to accurately predict the channel even for relatively high user mobility. However, there exists a class of channels characterized by large Doppler spread (high mobility) and clustered angular spread for which prediction is intrinsically difficult and all considered methods fail. We propose a modified PFS that take into account the ldquopredictabilityrdquo state of the UTs, and significantly outperform the classical PFS in the presence of prediction errors. The main conclusion of this work is that multiuser MIMO downlink yields very good performance even in the presence of high mobility users, provided that the non-predictable users are handled appropriately.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074378","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074378.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel state prediction, feedback and scheduling for a multiuser MIMO-OFDM downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074378/","displayDocTitle":"Channel state prediction, feedback and scheduling for a multiuser MIMO-OFDM downlink","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718738","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074378/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel state prediction, feedback and scheduling for a multiuser MIMO-OFDM downlink","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062388S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074379,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The optimal hard decision detection for MIMO wireless systems is the maximum likelihood (ML) detector. ML detection is attractive due to its superior performance (in terms of BER). However, direct implementation grows exponentially with the number of antennas and the modulation scheme, making its ASIC or FPGA implementation infeasible for all but low-density modulation schemes using a small number of antennas. Sphere decoding (SD) solves the ML detection problem in a computationally efficient manner. However, even with this complexity reduction, real-time implementation on a DSP processor is generally not feasible and high-performance parallel computing platforms such as FPGAs are increasingly being employed for this class of applications. The sphere detection problem affords many opportunities for algorithm and micro-architecture optimizations and tradeoffs. This paper provides an overview of techniques to simplify and minimize FPGA resource utilization of sphere detectors for high-performance low-latency systems.","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074383.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074383","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and architecture of spatial multiplexing MIMO decoders for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and architecture of spatial multiplexing MIMO decoders for FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074383/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074383/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718760","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and architecture of spatial multiplexing MIMO decoders for FPGAs","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108166S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074385,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Enineering, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Tulsa, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066688400"},{"name":"Samuel Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Enineering, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Tulsa, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37276497200"},{"name":"Qiang Wu","affiliation":["Sofgt Imaging LLC, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37308374600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074385","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":685},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074385","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Concurrent computing","Belief propagation","Computer architecture","Hardware","Software architecture","Coprocessors","Memory management","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","coprocessors","decoding","multi-threading","parity check codes","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel decoding algorithm","LDPC codes","CUDA","parallel belief propagation algorithm","low-density parity-check codes","Compute Unified Device Architecture","parallel data computing","multithreaded coprocessor","high memory bandwidth GPU","bit-nodes","check-nodes","graphics processor unit"]}],"abstract":"A parallel belief propagation algorithm for decoding low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is presented in this paper based on Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA).

It is natural to suppose that the same is true for MIMO radar, but the situation is not so clear. Researchers claim many advantages of MIMO radar relative to phased array radars (e.g., better detection performance, better angular resolution, better angular measurement accuracy, improved robustness against RFI & ECM & multipath, etc.). We will evaluate such assertions from a system engineering viewpoint. In particular, there are serious tradeoffs of MIMO vs. phased array radars relative to cost, system complexity and risk, considering numerous real world effects that are not included in most theoretical analyses. Moreover, in many cases one can achieve essentially the same radar system improvement with phased array radars using simpler less expensive and less risky algorithms. We evaluate roughly a dozen asserted advantages of MIMO radar relative to phased arrays.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074388","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074388.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar: Snake oil or good idea?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074388/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar: Snake oil or good idea?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10729468","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074388/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar: Snake oil or good idea?","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043184S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074389,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In, the MI was first applied to radar waveform design. However, the practical meaning of MI in the sensing context remains unclear. Recently, shows that under the white noise assumption, the water-filling scheme simultaneously maximizes the MI and minimizes the minimum MSE (MMSE). Such an equivalence disappears when the target parameter statistics are not perfectly known. To further the understanding of the practical meaning of MI and to establish a connection between MI and commonly adopted MSE measures for sensing, this paper takes a fresh look at the target estimation problem, by considering the general colored noise, incorporating the normalized MSE (NMSE), and establishing joint robust designs for both the transmitter (waveforms) and the receiver (estimator) under various target and noise uncertainty levels. Our results show that: i) the optimum waveform designs resulted from the MI, MMSE and NMSE criteria are all different; and ii) compared to MMSE, the NMSE-based designs share more similarities with the MI-based ones, especially when the target and noise statistics are not perfectly known.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074390","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074390.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"197","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication-inspired sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Communication-inspired sensing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074390/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718765","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074390/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication-inspired sensing","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052274S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074391,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The transmit waveforms could be uncorrelated, or correlated in order to achieve a desirable beampattern. The concept of compressive sampling is employed at the receive nodes in order to perform direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. According to the theory of compressive sampling, a signal that is sparse in some domain can be recovered based on far fewer samples than required by the Nyquist sampling theorem. The DOAs of targets form a sparse vector in the angle space, and therefore, compressive sampling can be applied for DOA estimation. The proposed approach achieves the superior resolution of MIMO radar with far fewer samples than other approaches.

While the first has to be solved in part in the analog part of the processing chain, due to the huge difference of signal strength between the direct blast and weak target reflections, the second is about combining enough signal efficiently, while not sacrificing too much performance. When combining this setup with digital multicarrier waveforms like orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) in digital audio/video broadcast (DAB/DVB), this problem can be seen to be a version of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. We start with an existing approach, based on efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) operation to detect target signatures, and show how this approach is related to a standard matched filter approach based on a piece-wise constant approximation of the phase rotation caused by Doppler shift. We then suggest two more applicable algorithms, one based on subspace processing and one based on sparse estimation. We compare these various approaches based on a detailed simulation scenario with two closing targets and experimental data recorded from a DAB network in Germany.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074394","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074394.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"213","endPage":"217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing for OFDM/MIMO radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing for OFDM/MIMO radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074394/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718769","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074394/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing for OFDM/MIMO radar","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065422S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074395,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel R.

While the problem is similar to previously reported measurement selection problems for Gaussian random vectors, there are some key differences stemming from the fact that the signal amplitude is a nuisance parameter. An objective function based on minimizing the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound is proposed. Through a linearization of the response vector and other simplifying assumptions, the objective function is reduced to a one-parameter function that is easily maximized. Simulation results comparing the optimal measurement to the traditional measurement suggest the potential for significantly improved estimator performance, although the linearization assumption is problematic when the parameter being estimated has a large prior variance.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074395","startPage":"218","endPage":"222","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074395.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive sensing of target signature with unknown amplitude","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive sensing of target signature with unknown amplitude","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074395/","accessionNumber":"10718770","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074395/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive sensing of target signature with unknown amplitude","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063669S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074399,"authors":[{"name":"Renato Candido","affiliation":["Electronic Systems Engineering Department, Escola Polit\u00e9cnica, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Candido","id":"37397419300"},{"name":"Magno T.

Our theoretical model deals, in a unified way, with any combinations based on the following algorithms: LMS, normalized LMS (NLMS), and recursive-least squares (RLS). Through the analysis, we observe that the affine combination of two algorithms of the same family with close adaptation parameters (step-sizes or forgetting factors) provides a 3 dB gain in relation to its best component filter. We study this behavior in stationary and nonstationary environments. Good agreement between analytical and simulation results is always observed. Furthermore, a simple geometrical interpretation of the affine combination is investigated. A model for the transient and steady-state behavior of two possible algorithms for estimation of the mixing parameter is proposed. The model explains situations in which adaptive combination algorithms may achieve good performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"236","endPage":"240","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074399.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Affine combinations of adaptive filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074399/","displayDocTitle":"Affine combinations of adaptive filters","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718773","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Affine combinations of adaptive filters","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051825S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5074402,"authors":[{"name":"Federico S.

Our simulations demonstrate that IAA and IAA-ML show better performance than the most competitive sparse signal representation approaches in the literature: M-FOCUSS, M-SBL and lscr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-SVD.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074408","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074408.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric and sparse signal representations in array processing via iterative adaptive approaches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074408/","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric and sparse signal representations in array processing via iterative adaptive approaches","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718799","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074408/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric and sparse signal representations in array processing via iterative adaptive approaches","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085921S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074415,"authors":[{"name":"Zhilan Xiong","affiliation":["Advanced Signal Processing Group, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Zhilan","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37404249200"},{"name":"Ranaji Krishna","affiliation":["Advanced Signal Processing Group, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Ranaji","lastName":"Krishna","id":"37528200800"},{"name":"Sangarapillai Lambotharan","affiliation":["Advanced Signal Processing Group, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Sangarapillai","lastName":"Lambotharan","id":"37273617900"},{"name":"Jonathon A.

Our particular interest lies in usually not considered system configurations where the base station is equipped with less antennas than the user terminals have in sum. For such scenarios, conventional block-diagonalization or zero-forcing techniques cannot be applied and even asymptotic results on the sum rate do not seem to exist. We show that the nonconvex problem at hand is closely related to a combinatorial stream selection and that choosing the number of active streams too high reduces the multiplexing gain and can even lead to a saturation of the sum rate, i.e., a multiplexing gain of zero. Besides the full featured reference algorithm probing all feasible stream allocation combinations, a reduced complexity successive version is presented as well. Both variants are based on the projected gradient algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074416","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074416.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"316","endPage":"320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A combinatorial approach to maximizing the sum rate in the MIMO BC with linear precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A combinatorial approach to maximizing the sum rate in the MIMO BC with linear precoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074416/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718806","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074416/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A combinatorial approach to maximizing the sum rate in the MIMO BC with linear precoding","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121964S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074417,"authors":[{"name":"Patricia Layec","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Layec","id":"37688331400"},{"name":"Pablo Piantanida","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Piantanida","id":"37293979700"},{"name":"Raphael Visoz","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Visoz","id":"37268925600"},{"name":"Antoine O.

We consider a training-based channel estimation at the receiver while a limited-rate feedback channel conveys the transmitter information. Imperfect knowledge comes from the channel estimation errors and the quantization noise. Restricting the decoder to be linear yields to minimize of the sum-mean square error (sum-MSE) subject to individual power constraints. Although no closed-form solution is possible in a multi-user setting, an efficient iterative algorithm relying on the KKT conditions is derived.

The beamforming technique that maximizes the achievable sum-rate in the multi-user, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC) has the distinct form of a regularized channel inversion (RCI). This current work adapts the method used for BC sum-rate maximization to maximize the sum-rate in the MIMO multiple-access channel (MAC) under fixed, per-user power constraints. This beamformer is based on accurate channel state information (CSI) resulting in performance degradation when only erroneous CSI is available at the receiver. Consequently, we develop an additional beamformer based on channel distribution information at the transmitter and/or receiver that attempts to maximize the average sum-rate, allowing for a stability/throughput tradeoff in the MAC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074418.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"330","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instantaneous and average rate maximization in MIMO multiple-access channels (MAC) with linear processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Array signal processing","Transmitters","Broadcasting","Channel state information","Degradation","Throughput","Delay estimation","Computer errors","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","linear codes","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instantaneous rate maximization","average rate maximization","MIMO multiple-access channels","linear processing","linear precoding","regularized channel inversion","sum-rate maximization","channel state information","channel distribution information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous and average rate maximization in MIMO multiple-access channels (MAC) with linear processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074418/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718808","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous and average rate maximization in MIMO multiple-access channels (MAC) with linear processing","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052073S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074419,"authors":[{"name":"Roland Tresch","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Center Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Tresch","id":"37403233800"},{"name":"Christian Mehlfuhrer","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Mehlfuhrer","id":"37296855600"},{"name":"Maxime Guillaud","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Center Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Maxime","lastName":"Guillaud","id":"37403232700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074419","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Interference","Downlink","Equations","Statistics","Throughput","Performance gain","Yield estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","higher order statistics","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LMMSE channel estimation","out-of-cell interference mitigation","MIMO W-CDMA system","intracell interference","receive-side spatial correlation","Toeplitz linear equation sets","second-order statistics"]}],"abstract":"An LMMSE channel estimator is proposed for the downlink of a MIMO W-CDMA system.

Finding the optimum user allocation, transmit and receive filters for maximizing sum rate in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel constitutes a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem. Here we present an efficient linear zero-forcing algorithm for this problem, which is derived from maximizing a lower bound for the sum rate. It successively allocates data streams to users and in contrast to state of the art approaches thereby also determines the corresponding receive filters. Compared to existing approaches drastic complexity reductions can be achieved even with slight performance gains.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074420","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074420.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"336","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient linear successive allocation for the MIMO broadcast channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient linear successive allocation for the MIMO broadcast channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074420/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718810","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074420/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient linear successive allocation for the MIMO broadcast channel","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057874S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5074421,"authors":[{"name":"Chinmay S.

A key step in this problem is to determine the optimal inflation factor (under Costa's choice of auxiliary random variable) when there is only partial CSIT. Towards this end, two iterative numerical algorithms are proposed. Both of these algorithms are seen to yield a good choice for the inflation factor. Finally, the high-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) behavior of the achievable rate over the FDPC is dealt with. It is proved that FDPC (with t transmit and r receive antennas) achieves the largest possible scaling factor of min(t,r) log SNR even with no CSIT. Furthermore, in the high SNR regime, the optimality of Costa's choice of auxiliary random variable is established even when there is partial (or no) CSIT in the special case of FDPC with t les r. Using the high-SNR scaling-law result of the FDPC (mentioned before), it is shown that a DPC-based multi-user transmission strategy, unlike other beamforming-based multi-user strategies, can achieve a single-user sum-rate scaling factor over the multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian Broadcast Channel with partial (or no) CSIT.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074421.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"345","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dirty Paper Coding for fading channels with partial transmitter side information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Random variables","MIMO","Auxiliary transmitters","Iterative algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Broadcasting","Interference","Receiving antennas","Memoryless systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","channel coding","fading channels","Gaussian channels","multiuser channels","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dirty paper coding","partial transmitter side information","fading dirty paper channel","Costa channel","inflation factor","signal-to-noise ratio","transmit antennas","receive antennas","multiuser transmission","beamforming","Gaussian broadcast channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Auxiliary random variable","Dirty Paper Coding","Inflation factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dirty Paper Coding for fading channels with partial transmitter side information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074421/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718811","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dirty Paper Coding for fading channels with partial transmitter side information","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052263S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074422,"authors":[{"name":"Jorg Wagner","affiliation":[" Communication Technology Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37402634600"},{"name":"Armin Wittneben","affiliation":[" Communication Technology Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Wittneben","id":"37264987800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074422","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Spread spectrum communication","Relays","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Communications technology","Laboratories","Performance analysis","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity scaling","MIMO amplify-and-forward multihop networks","noncooperating relay antennas","asymptotic capacity analysis","channel matrices","Marcenko-Pastur law"]}],"abstract":"Consider a multiple-input-multiple-output-multihop network consisting of n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</sub>\n noncooperating source antennas, n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</sub>\n fully cooperating destination antennas, and L clusters of n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</sub>\n noncooperating relay antennas each.

Nonetheless, the additional resource consumption to deploy the relay station reduces the system throughput significantly. The zero-forcing (ZF)-based two-phase relaying scheme that requires only two phases to communicate a frame was suggested for the system where a single mobile station is considered. The performance bottle-necks of the conventional ZF-based two-phase relaying are channel asymmetry and an ill-conditioned channel that reduces the effective channel gain. We propose a novel two-phase relaying scheme to support multiple users simultaneously for a given channel resource. The proposed relaying scheme includes the multiuser scheduling at the relay station and the additional precoding at the base station to make the effective channels from the base and mobile stations equal to each other. We evaluate the proposed relaying scheme by numerically comparing its sum rate to those of the conventional relaying schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074423","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074423.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"351","endPage":"355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-forcing-based two-phase relaying with multiple mobile stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Zero-forcing-based two-phase relaying with multiple mobile stations","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074423/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718831","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074423/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-forcing-based two-phase relaying with multiple mobile stations","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06449S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074427,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Luen Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng-Luen","lastName":"Wei","id":"37309427800"},{"name":"John J.

Transmit beamformers can be designed by setting constraints on the interference temperature of the licensed users and signal to interference and noise ratios (SINRs) of the cognitive users. This design is however very sensitive to errors in channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we propose robust and non-robust beamforming techniques for multiuser cognitive radios. The proposed beamformer has the ability to maintain the SINRs of all unlicensed users above a target value for all possible errors in the CSI. The problem is formulated within a convex optimization framework with constraints on worst-case errors which can be solved using interior point methods. The performance of the robust beamformer is compared with non-robust beamformer in terms of BER of the unlicensed users and the probability density function of the achieved SINRs.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074429","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074429.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"378","endPage":"382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust interference control techniques for multiuser cognitive radios using worst-case performance optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust interference control techniques for multiuser cognitive radios using worst-case performance optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074429/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718835","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074429/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust interference control techniques for multiuser cognitive radios using worst-case performance optimization","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044932S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074430,"authors":[{"name":"Bryan A.

Comparisons are made to a conventional approach that uses no prior information.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074430","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074430.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074430","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","startPage":"383","endPage":"387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive beamforming enhancements in relation to active-passive data fusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Passive beamforming enhancements in relation to active-passive data fusion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074430/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074430/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718836","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive beamforming enhancements in relation to active-passive data fusion","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071698S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5074432,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungchul Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungchul","lastName":"Kim","id":"37310671200"},{"name":"Jungwoo Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jungwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280330400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074432","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Array signal processing","Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas","Channel state information","Transmitters","Approximation algorithms","Antenna accessories","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","error statistics","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","space division multiplexing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO beamforming systems","antenna grouping techniques","spatial multiplexing","diversity gain","transmit antennas","receive antennas","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate antenna grouping algorithms which are hybrids of beamforming and spatial multiplexing.

Moreover, an adaptive beamformer is used to mitigate the effect of the extremely low signal-to-noise ration of the extracted features. The sensor array scans local portions of the structure, providing accurate spatial selectivity and high signal-to-noise ratio for any given scan direction. The sensor array is in direct contact with the structure; therefore, the measured signal is in the near-field of the array, and spherical near-field compensation is necessary.

MHPSK is a spectrally efficient modulation technique that uses four orthonormal basis functions to increase the Euclidean distance between different symbols in the signal space. Spectral efficiency and probability of bit error are two key figures of merit used to evaluate digital modulation techniques. The use of four orthonormal basis functions provides an advantage over traditional modulation techniques such as M-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) that only possess two degrees of freedom. MHPSK offers an improvement in bit error performance over other spectrally efficient modulation techniques for the same average energy per bit-to-noise power spectral density ratio and the same spectral efficiency. As a result, MHPSK offers a novel way to improve both throughput and reduce power requirements using easy to generate waveforms. In this paper, long block length Reed Solomon (RS) codes are used to encode information symbols which are then transmitted with MHPSK. The results are compared with those obtained when data is encoded with the digital video broadcast (DVB) standard rate r = 0.9 low density parity check (LDPC) code commonly employed in satellite communications for high spectral efficiency broadcasts and transmitted with either 8-PSK, 16-PSK or 16-QAM. The performance obtained with MHPSK, 8-PSK, 16-PSK, and 16-QAM is compared in terms of probability of bit error and bandwidth efficiency when long FEC block lengths are used.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074437","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074437.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"413","endPage":"417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long block length reed solomon coded M-ary hyper phase-shift keying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Long block length reed solomon coded M-ary hyper phase-shift keying","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074437/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718842","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074437/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long block length reed solomon coded M-ary hyper phase-shift keying","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08109S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5074440,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Maurer","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Maurer","id":"37285341000"},{"name":"Joakim Jalden","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"Jalden","id":"37284731500"},{"name":"Gerald Matz","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Matz","id":"37284513500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074440","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Quantization","Broadcasting","Channel state information","Transmitting antennas","Power system modeling","Receiving antennas","Radio frequency","Power engineering and energy","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","multibeam antennas","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multithreshold TOP","full-diversity vector perturbation precoding","finite-rate feedforward","multiple antenna broadcast","power normalization factor","channel equalization","transmit outage precoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074440","abstract":"We consider vector perturbation (VP) precoding for a multiple antenna broadcast scenario with multiple non-cooperative users.

To overcome this problem, we propose a new precoding scheme that uses a finite set of power normalization factors and avoids transmission at all when the available power is not sufficient to perform channel equalization at the transmit side.

This so-called variational Bayes incremental expectation maximization (VB-IEM) algorithm has two virtues: first, it non-decreases an objective function at each iteration and secondly, it adopts the convergence properties of the exact EM algorithm if the parameter estimate is consistent and maximum a posteriori. When the VB-IEM algorithm is applied to joint multi-user decoding and multi-channel estimation in flat Rayleigh fading, Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed scheme supports extremely high effective system loads.","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074442.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"442","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Bayesian soft multiuser decoding and multichannel estimation based on the variational IEM algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint Bayesian soft multiuser decoding and multichannel estimation based on the variational IEM algorithm","htmlLink":"/document/5074442/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10718900","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Bayesian soft multiuser decoding and multichannel estimation based on the variational IEM algorithm","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086678S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074443,"authors":[{"name":"Clemens Novak","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik und Hochfrequenztechnik, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Novak","id":"37411500500"},{"name":"Gottfried Lechner","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Gottfried","lastName":"Lechner","id":"37284749400"},{"name":"Gerald Matz","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik und Hochfrequenztechnik, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Matz","id":"37284513500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074443","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel state information","Information analysis","Parity check codes","Demodulation","MIMO","Interleaved codes","Modulation coding","Iterative decoding","Rayleigh channels","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","interleaved codes","iterative decoding","MIMO communication","parity check codes","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-BICM","channel state information","LDPC code optimization","bit-interleaved coded modulation","iterative decoding","channel estimates","Rayleigh fading","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"We investigate MIMO systems employing bit-interleaved coded modulation and iterative decoding with imperfect channel estimates.

Perfect orthogonality is impossible to achieve, and in reality adaptive processing is necessary to remove interference, with some mismatch loss in main lobe size. This study proposes a method of composing waveforms from mutually-orthogonal complementary sets. Each transmitter is assigned a set of complementary waveforms to be separated in frequency. Nonlinear processing of matched filter outputs can completely remove cross-transmitter interference and suppress autocorrelation sidelobes without cost. Cross terms introduced by the nonlinear operation are handled via frequency agility and Doppler processing. The principle is demonstrated by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074457","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074457.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of complementary sets in MIMO radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074457/","displayDocTitle":"The use of complementary sets in MIMO radar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718878","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074457/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of complementary sets in MIMO radar","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042258S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074459,"authors":[{"name":"Tuomas Aittomaki","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, SMARAD CoE, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Aittomaki","id":"37391626000"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, SMARAD CoE, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074459","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radar cross section","Radar scattering","Fluctuations","Diversity methods","Radar signal processing","Transmitters","Array signal processing","Fading","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radar","radionavigation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar direction finding","multiple waveforms","statistical MIMO radar","Swerling scattering model","Cramer-Rao bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","radar","array signal processing"]}],"abstract":"A MIMO radar uses multiple waveforms and other forms of diversity to improve the performance.

In practice, however, direct digitization of this broadband RF environment is problematic. Physical limitations in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology restrict the total bandwidth that can be digitized, as well as the ability to digitize high RF signals directly. This paper describes a novel ldquoanalog-to-informationrdquo receiver, motivated by recent developments in compressed sensing (CS), which overcomes both of these challenges in certain settings. The proposed receiver performs frequency modulated pulsed sampling at sub-Nyquist/Shannon rates to compress a broadband RF environment into an analog interpolation filter. The RF sample clock modulation induces a Nyquist-zone dependent frequency modulation on the received signals, allowing separation and recovery of the signal information from a sparse broadband RF environment.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074464","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074464.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nyquist folding analog-to-information receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074464/","displayDocTitle":"A Nyquist folding analog-to-information receiver","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718901","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074464/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nyquist folding analog-to-information receiver","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059537S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074471,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Compared with other state-of-the-art greedy algorithms, the most innovative feature of the SAMP is its capability of signal reconstruction without prior information of the sparsity. This makes it a promising candidate for many practical applications when the number of non-zero (significant) coefficients of a signal is not available. The proposed algorithm adopts a similar flavor of the EM algorithm, which alternatively estimates the sparsity and the true support set of the target signals. In fact, SAMP provides a generalized greedy reconstruction framework in which the orthogonal matching pursuit and the subspace pursuit can be viewed as its special cases. Such a connection also gives us an intuitive justification of trade-offs between computational complexity and reconstruction performance. While the SAMP offers a comparably theoretical guarantees as the best optimization-based approach, simulation results show that it outperforms many existing iterative algorithms, especially for compressible signals.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074472","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074472.pdf","startPage":"581","endPage":"587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm for practical compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm for practical compressed sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074472/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10718909","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074472/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm for practical compressed sensing","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06296S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"251","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5074474,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Miller","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratories, Lexington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Miller","id":"37288481800"},{"name":"Joel Goodman","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratories, Lexington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Goodman","id":"37296258700"},{"name":"Matthew Herman","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratories, Lexington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Herman","id":"37573191200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074474","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Polynomials","Nonlinear distortion","Kernel","Computer architecture","Dynamic range","Interleaved codes","Analog-digital conversion","Nonlinear filters","Finite impulse response filter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","nonlinear equations","nonlinear filters","sequential estimation","Volterra equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polyphase nonlinear equalization","semi-blind identification method","Volterra kernel","nonlinear filters","equalizer identification process"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Polyphase nonlinear equalization architecture and semi-blind identification method","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","endPage":"597","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074474.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074474","startPage":"593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074474","abstract":"In this paper, we present an architecture and semi-blind identification method for a polyphase nonlinear equalizer (pNLEQ).

Considerations in transmit waveform and receive filter design are central to attaining improved performance through a MIMO system. Moreover, adaptive array techniques are needed to improve accuracy, resolution and to further provide interference suppression. Recently, the weighted least-squares based iterative adaptive approach (IAA), a non-parametric and user parameter-free method was shown to provide good performance for array processing. In this paper, we demonstrate how IAA can be extended for MIMO radar applications. Our simulations show that IAA outperforms other well-established methods in the field.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074478","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074478.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"609","endPage":"613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse signal representation for MIMO radar imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse signal representation for MIMO radar imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074478/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718914","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074478/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse signal representation for MIMO radar imaging","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086976S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074479,"authors":[{"name":"Hana Godrich","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hana","lastName":"Godrich","id":"37392162300"},{"name":"Alexander M.

MIMO radar systems with coherent processing and a single target were shown to benefit from a coherency and spatial advantages. The first is proportional to the ratio of the signal carrier frequency to the effective bandwidth, while the latter provides a gain proportional to the product of the number of transmitting and receiving sensors. In the current study, the model in extended to the estimation accuracy of multiple targets. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the multiple targets localization problem is derived and analyzed. The localization is shown to benefit from coherency advantage. The tradeoff between target localization accuracy and the number of targets that can be localized is shown to be incorporated in the spatial advantage term. An increase in the number of targets to be localized exposes the system to increased mutual interferences. This tradeoff depends on the geometric footprint of both the sensors and the targets, and the relative positions of the two. Numerical analysis of some special cases offers an insight to the mutual relation between a given deployment of radars and targets and the spatial advantage it presents.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074479.pdf","startPage":"614","endPage":"618","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target localization accuracy and multiple target localization: Tradeoff in MIMO radars","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radar antennas","Frequency","Bandwidth","Numerical analysis","Narrowband","Parameter estimation","Direction of arrival estimation","Interference","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherence","MIMO communication","radar tracking","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target localization","MIMO radars","coherent processing","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radars","CRLB","target localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Target localization accuracy and multiple target localization: Tradeoff in MIMO radars","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074479/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718915","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target localization accuracy and multiple target localization: Tradeoff in MIMO radars","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067984S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074480,"authors":[{"name":"Qian He","affiliation":["EE Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China","EE Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"He","id":"37308640100"},{"name":"Rick S.

We consider several special classes of channels. As the first model, we consider the degraded multi-receiver wiretap channel where the legitimate receivers exhibit a degradedness order while the eavesdropper is more noisy with respect to all legitimate receivers. We establish the secrecy capacity region of this channel model. Secondly, we consider the parallel multi-receiver wiretap channel with a less noisiness order in each sub-channel, where this order is not necessarily the same for all sub-channels. We establish the common message secrecy capacity and sum secrecy capacity of this channel. Thirdly, we study a special class of degraded parallel multi-receiver wiretap channels and provide a stronger result. In particular, we study the case with two sub-channels two users and one eavesdropper, where there is a degradedness order in each sub-channel such that in the first (resp. second) sub-channel the second (resp. first) receiver is degraded with respect to the first (resp. second) receiver, while the eavesdropper is degraded with respect to both legitimate receivers in both sub-channels. We determine the secrecy capacity region of this channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074493.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"680","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On secure broadcasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Degradation","Transmitters","Educational institutions","Computer security","Channel capacity","Noise figure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","receivers","security of data","telecommunication security","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication security","transmitter","multiple receivers","broadcast channel","eavesdropper","wiretap channel","secrecy capacity region","sum secrecy capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"On secure broadcasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074493/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718943","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On secure broadcasting","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075503S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5074496,"authors":[{"name":"Onur Sahin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New york University, USA"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Sahin","id":"37304614500"},{"name":"Elza Erkip","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New york University, USA"],"firstName":"Elza","lastName":"Erkip","id":"37266656500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074496","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"abstract":"We consider one-sided interference channel with two independent source-destination pairs, and a cognitive relay with only a link to the destination that observes interference.

We further analyze a more realistic set-up where instead of source messages, the relay knows the transmitted signals of both sources and is unaware of the codebooks. We investigate the achievable region under this signal cognitive assumption and further obtain a converse, thereby the capacity region under strong relay-interference conditions. Our results suggest that while relaying is usually utilized as an effective technique for boosting received signal quality, in the presence of interference, an equally important task of the relay is to manage the interference.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference channels","Decoding","Boosting","Transmitters","Interference cancellation","Signal analysis","Quality management","Signal design","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio links","relays","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one-sided interference channel","source-destination pair","cognitive relay","signal message","message cognitive","source message","codebook","signal cognitive assumption","relay-interference condition","signal quality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074496","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074496.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive relaying with one-sided interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive relaying with one-sided interference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074496/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074496/","accessionNumber":"10718946","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive relaying with one-sided interference","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062184S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074497,"authors":[{"name":"Anelia Somekh-Baruch","affiliation":["Department of ElectricalEngineering, Princeton University, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Anelia","lastName":"Somekh-Baruch","id":"38270337000"},{"name":"Sriram Sridharan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"37705263600"},{"name":"Sriram Vishwanath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Vishwanath","id":"37283401100"},{"name":"Sergio Verdu","affiliation":["Department of ElectricalEngineering, Princeton University, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Verdu","id":"37274351500"},{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":["Department of ElectricalEngineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai","id":"37267375900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074497","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Interference channels","Performance analysis","Relays","Gaussian distribution","Random variables","Communication systems","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio receivers","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radios","multiple access networks","information theoretic model","uplink system","cognitive transmitter-receiver pair","primary transmitters","primary receiver","channel gain"]}],"abstract":"This paper analyzes the fundamental limits of performance of cognitive radios in a multiple access setting.

Based on recently found outer bounds on the capacity region of unfaded IFCs, we determine the power allocation that maximizes a sum-rate outer bound. With this power allocation both users are simultaneously active when the power of the interfering signals is small relative to the power of the intended signals. Otherwise, only the user with the largest fading gain is active, similar to multi-access and broadcast channels. By considering a simplified version of the Han-Kobayashi region, we derive the power allocation that maximizes a sum-rate inner bound. Numerical results for iid Rayleigh fading show that the inner and our bounds are very close to one another. The structure of the determined power allocation policies suggests that practical power allocations can be designed based on only a bit of channel state information.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074498","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074498.pdf","startPage":"701","endPage":"706","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian fading interference channels: Power control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian fading interference channels: Power control","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074498/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718948","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074498/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian fading interference channels: Power control","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04405S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5074502,"authors":[{"name":"Vaneet Aggarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Vaneet","lastName":"Aggarwal","id":"37302263100"},{"name":"Gajanana Krishna","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gajanana","lastName":"Krishna","id":"37865326500"},{"name":"Srikrishna Bhashyam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Srikrishna","lastName":"Bhashyam","id":"37294831000"},{"name":"Ashutosh Sabharwal","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ashutosh","lastName":"Sabharwal","id":"37270204100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074502","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel state information","State feedback","Frequency conversion","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Power system modeling","Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication","time division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy feedback","MIMO channels","frequency division duplex system","time division duplex system","diversity multiplexing tradeoff"]}],"abstract":"Two distinct models of feedback, suited for FDD (frequency division duplex) and TDD (time division duplex) systems respectively, have been widely studied in the literature.

We find that, when all imperfections are accounted for, the maximum achievable diversity order in FDD systems matches the diversity order in TDD systems. TDD systems achieve better diversity order at higher multiplexing gains. In FDD systems, the maximum diversity order can be achieved with just a single bit of feedback.

To facilitate feedback and signaling, the precoding matrix for each rank is often restricted to a finite pre-determined codebook. Prior research has studied the problem of designing the codebook independently for each rank, with the aim of maximizing throughput gains for a given codebook size. In this paper, we propose to jointly design the family of codebooks for various transmission ranks. Our nested codebooks greatly simplify both codebook design and the selection of precoding matrix for a specific channel. In addition, we prove by analysis and simulation results that the complexity reduction is obtained without sacrificing throughput gains. Due to these advantages, the proposed structured codeboook design has been accepted for use in the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nested codebook design for MIMO precoders","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074503","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074503.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Nested codebook design for MIMO precoders","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074503/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718969","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nested codebook design for MIMO precoders","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10214S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074504,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Pugh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Pugh","id":"37684076400"},{"name":"Bhaskar D.

The distribution function of the maximum SINR is derived and is noted to differ from previous work. In an effort to further reduce feedback, a scheme where each user feeds back the maximum SINR observed over its receive antennas and transmit beams. Using the Frechet bounds and properties of chi-squared random variables, the throughput of this system is bounded and empirically shown to approach the performance of the previous scheme as the number of users increases.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074504.pdf","startPage":"728","endPage":"732","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the capacity of MIMO broadcast channels with reduced feedback by antenna selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Feedback","Antenna feeds","Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Performance analysis","Array signal processing","Distribution functions","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","feedback","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO broadcast channel","channel capacity","reduced feedback","antenna selection","random beamforming schemes","multiuser Gaussian broadcast channel","SINR feedback","multiple receive antennas","distribution function","transmit beams","Frechet bounds","chi-squared random variables"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-user MIMO","broadcast channel","random beamforming","LMMSE receivers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the capacity of MIMO broadcast channels with reduced feedback by antenna selection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074504/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718970","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the capacity of MIMO broadcast channels with reduced feedback by antenna selection","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069777S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074505,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Bayesteh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Bayesteh","id":"37327977200"},{"name":"Amir K.

It is assumed that the receivers have perfect channel state information (CSI), while the BS only knows the partial CSI, provided by the receivers via feedback. We study the minimum amount of feedback required at the BS, to achieve the maximum sum-rate capacity in the asymptotic case of N rarr infin, considering various signal to noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The amount of feedback is defined as the total average number of binits sent to the BS from the users. It is shown in the paper that i) In the low and fixed SNR regimes, it is not possible to achieve the maximum sum-rate with finite amount of feedback. Moreover, in order to get arbitrarily close to the sum-rate capacity in the fixed SNR regime, the amount of feedback must grow logarithmically with the sum-rate capacity. It is also established that random beam-forming scheme, proposed in, is feedback optimal in these regimes. ii) In the high SNR regime, the minimum required amount of feedback to achieve the sum-rate capacity depends on the number of receive antennas; in the case of K < M and large enough SNR, the minimum amount of feedback grows linearly with the sum-rate capacity and in the case of K ges M, it grows at most logarithmically with the sum-rate capacity. Furthermore, the amount of feedback does not need to grow with SNR in the case of K ges M.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074505","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074505.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"733","endPage":"737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback requirements in MIMO broadcast channels: An asymptotic analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feedback requirements in MIMO broadcast channels: An asymptotic analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074505/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718971","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074505/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback requirements in MIMO broadcast channels: An asymptotic analysis","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095584S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5074506,"authors":[{"name":"Eunmo Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Eunmo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37827772000"},{"name":"Akbar M.

Inspired by the statistical structure of the MIMO-OFDM channel matrix, the proposed transceiver structure consists of two components: (i) a fixed space-frequency code, and (ii) a set of spatial precoding matrices that are adapted based on limited feedback from the receiver. For the fixed component, we propose a structured space-frequency coding scheme that spreads the source symbols across space and frequency. The space-frequency coded symbols are then processed with a spatial precoding matrix for each OFDM tone before transmission. The spatial precoding matrices use the limited feedback from the receiver to adapt the spatial directions and corresponding power allocation for different spatial symbols, in order to improve both the mutual information and error rate. Since the spatial channel statistics are invariant across frequency, one codebook of spatial precoding matrices suffices for all OFDM tones. This codebook is designed using a systematic algorithm that we had previously developed for narrowband spatially correlated MIMO channels. Finally, to reduce the computational complexity at the receiver and the amount of feedback to the transmitter, we propose a new interpolation algorithm in which the codebook indices are fed back to the transmitter for a subset of tones - precoding matrices for the other tones are computed at the transmitter using the precoding matrices for tones in the subset.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074506.pdf","startPage":"738","endPage":"742","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolated linear precoding and space-frequency coding for MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Feedback","Transmitters","MIMO","Transceivers","Mutual information","Error analysis","Statistics","Algorithm design and analysis","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","feedback","interpolation","linear codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding","transceivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolated linear precoding","fixed space-frequency code","MIMO-OFDM systems","feedback-aided precoding schemes","multiple-input multiple-output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MIMO-OFDM channel matrix","transceiver structure","spatial precoding matrices","limited feedback","structured space-frequency coding scheme","power allocation","error rate","mutual information","spatial channel statistics","narrowband spatially correlated MIMO channels","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Interpolated linear precoding and space-frequency coding for MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074506/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718972","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolated linear precoding and space-frequency coding for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101743S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074507,"authors":[{"name":"Robert W.

These butterfly operations can be implemented with two fused primitives, a fused two-term inner product and a fused add subtract unit. A floating-point fused FFT Butterfly unit is presented that performs single-precision butterfly floating-point operation in a time that is only 87% the time required for a conventional floating-point butterfly. When placed and routed in a 45 nm process, the fused FFT Butterfly unit occupied about 72% of the area needed to implement a floating-point butterfly using conventional floating-point adders and multipliers. The numerical result of the fused butterfly unit is more accurate because fewer rounding operations are needed.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074512","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074512.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"767","endPage":"771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fused floating-point arithmetic for DSP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fused floating-point arithmetic for DSP","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074512/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718977","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fused floating-point arithmetic for DSP","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054401S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074514,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Doche","affiliation":["Department of Computing Division of Information and Communication Sciences, Macquarie University, North Ryde, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Doche","id":"37938945500"},{"name":"Laurent Imbert","affiliation":["Centre for Information Security and Cryptography, PIMS, CNRS and University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Imbert","id":"37271937300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074514","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074514","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elliptic curve cryptography","Elliptic curves","Public key cryptography","Greedy algorithms","Information security","Cryptographic protocols","Galois fields","Handwriting recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-base number system","elliptic curve cryptography","double-scalar multiplication"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074514","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074514.pdf","startPage":"777","endPage":"780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The double-base number system in elliptic curve cryptography","abstract":"Three algorithms for double-scalar multiplication on elliptic curves, based on the representations of a pair of integers as mixed powers of 2 and 3, are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074514/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10718979","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The double-base number system in elliptic curve cryptography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The double-base number system in elliptic curve cryptography","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000777.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041603S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074527,"authors":[{"name":"Lee C.

Emphasis is given to the underdetermined and sparse case, i.e., fewer observations than regression coefficients and the belief that only a few regression coefficients are non-zero. The fast update allows for a low-complexity method of reporting a set of models with high posterior probability and their exact posterior odds. As a byproduct, this Bayesian model averaged approach yields the minimum mean squared error estimate of unknown coefficients. Algorithm complexity is linear in the number of unknown coefficients, the number of observations and the number of nonzero coefficients.

We present a new autofocus algorithm, termed Fourier-domain MultiChannel Autofocus (FMCA), which is derived using a linear algebraic framework that allows the SAR image to be focused in a noniterative fashion. Motivated by the MutiChannel Autofocus (MCA) approach, the proposed autofocus algorithm also invokes an assumption on the underlying image support. However, it works with the collected Fourier data directly and is capable of accommodating both wide-angle monostatic SAR and bistatic SAR. Previous SAR autofocus algorithms rely on the assumption that radar's range of look angles is small, and may depend upon characteristics of the SAR scene. The performance of these autofocus algorithms degrades if the assumptions are violated. The proposed algorithm has the advantage that its formulation makes no assumptions about the range of look angles or characteristics of the scene.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074529","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074529.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"852","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fourier-domain Multichannel Autofocus for synthetic aperture radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fourier-domain Multichannel Autofocus for synthetic aperture radar","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074529/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074529/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fourier-domain Multichannel Autofocus for synthetic aperture radar","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039883S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5074536,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Papalexidis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Papalexidis","id":"38556936700"},{"name":"T.

An adaptation process that switches between beamforming, diversity and multiplexing modes in combination with various modulation schemes is based on the effective SINR. Mutual information effective SINR mapping method is used as a part of the spatial and modulation scheme selection process due to its capability for estimating the error rate performance of large variety of MIMO channels accurately. Simulation results show that a simple adaptive system which applies diversity and multiplexing modes attains good performance in realistic 2 times 2 MIMO channels.

When this improved channel estimate is used to detect OFDM data symbols, large improvement in bit error rate is observed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency domain joint channel and phase noise estimation in OFDM WLAN systems","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074547","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074547.pdf","startPage":"928","endPage":"932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Frequency domain joint channel and phase noise estimation in OFDM WLAN systems","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074547/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719023","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency domain joint channel and phase noise estimation in OFDM WLAN systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000928.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055116S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074549,"authors":[{"name":"Qijia Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Technology Research Institute, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Qijia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37403283400"},{"name":"Xiaoli Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Technology Research Institute, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279528400"},{"name":"G.

Optimally distorting the transmitted constellation for peak reduction in OFDM systems was introduced and shown to be a convex optimization problem. This work advantageously extends this approach to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. While the problem is still convex, solving the problem using standard convex optimization techniques quickly becomes computationally prohibitive for a large number of tones and/or antennas. This paper therefore also proposes solving the optimization problem using an interior-point method (IPM) based on the conjugate-gradient (CG) algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074550.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"947","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal constellation distortion for PAR reduction in MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","MIMO","OFDM modulation","Transmitting antennas","Constellation diagram","Distortion","Peak to average power ratio","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Contacts","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","convex programming","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal constellation distortion","peak-to-average-ratio reduction","MIMO-OFDM systems","convex optimization problem","interior-point method","conjugate-gradient algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal constellation distortion for PAR reduction in MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074550/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719026","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal constellation distortion for PAR reduction in MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000943.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036752S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074553,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Peng","id":"37405085400"},{"name":"Giridhar Mandyam","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Giridhar","lastName":"Mandyam","id":"37270329300"},{"name":"Dinesh Rajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Rajan","id":"37270183200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074553","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","OFDM","Wideband","Bandwidth","Downlink","Fading","Multipath channels","RAKE receivers","Interference","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","code division multiple access","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband cellular systems","downlink transport spectral efficiency","DS-CDMA","RAKE receiver","LMMSE receiver","multiuser cyclic prefix OFDM","zero padding OFDM","output signal to interference noise ratio","base station density"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we compare the downlink transport spectral efficiency (TSE) of DS-CDMA using RAKE receiver, LMMSE receiver, the multiuser cyclic prefix OFDM and zero padding OFDM in wideband cellular systems.

It is derived in terms of the output signal to interference noise ratio as the sum of products of bits and the distances over which they are carried per unit time and bandwidth.

Unfortunately, OFDM becomes vulnerable to large Doppler spread, since subcarriers lose their orthogonality giving rise for so-called intercarrier interference. Among previous proposals to cope with this problem was the use of multiple receive antennas. These are positioned in the moving direction of the receiver such that the individual antennas are receiving delayed replica of the transmit signal via identical paths. By means of interpolation this enables to fabric virtual non-moving antennas which seemingly experience no Doppler spread. However, knowledge of the temporal channel autocorrelation function is required to perform this interpolation. This paper presents a method to estimate the autocorrelation function in time domain based on the cylic OFDM signaling structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074561.pdf","startPage":"995","endPage":"999","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal autocorrelation estimation for OFDM with application to spatial interpolation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","OFDM","Interpolation","Receiving antennas","Interference","Proposals","Directive antennas","Transmitting antennas","Delay","Fabrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","channel estimation","intercarrier interference","interpolation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal autocorrelation estimation","spatial interpolation","OFDM frequency-selective channels","Doppler spread","intercarrier interference","virtual nonmoving antennas","temporal channel autocorrelation function","time domain","cylic OFDM signaling structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Temporal autocorrelation estimation for OFDM with application to spatial interpolation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074561/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719036","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal autocorrelation estimation for OFDM with application to spatial interpolation","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083272S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074563,"authors":[{"name":"Ghaleb Al-Habian","affiliation":["ECE Department, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ghaleb","lastName":"Al-Habian","id":"37590895800"},{"name":"Ali Ghrayeb","affiliation":["ECE Department, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada","EE Department, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghrayeb","id":"37278225300"},{"name":"Mazen Hasna","affiliation":["EE Department, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mazen","lastName":"Hasna","id":"37273431400"},{"name":"Adnan Abu-Dayya","affiliation":["EE Department, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Abu-Dayya","id":"38180073600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074563","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Relays","Error correction codes","Error correction","Communication system control","Context","Upper bound","Bit error rate","Cyclic redundancy check codes","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic redundancy check codes","error statistics","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed turbo coding","log-likelihood thresholding","cooperative communications","error propagation","bit-error rates","cyclic redundancy code"]}],"abstract":"In cooperative communications, error propagation at relays reduces the diversity order of the system. To combat that effect, we present a novel technique to control error propagation at the relays, which is presented in the context of a relay cooperating with a source to communicate with a destination using a turbo code. The relay calculates log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values for the bits sent from the source. These value are subjected to a threshold to selectively forward bits that are most reliable and discard bits that are less so, resulting in less errors propagating to the destination. We derive upper bounds on the bit-error rates for our proposed system and use them to optimize the threshold at the relay, showing that our system provides a better trade off between prevented errors and blocked correct bits. We compare our scheme with controlling error propagation using only a cyclic redundancy code(CRC) check at the relay, forwarding analog LLR values, and employing no error control at the relay at all. Based on system simulations, we show that our proposed scheme provides a significant diversity gain compared to other techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074563","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074563.pdf","startPage":"1005","endPage":"1009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed turbo coding using log-likelihood thresholding for cooperative communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074563/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed turbo coding using log-likelihood thresholding for cooperative communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719038","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074563/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed turbo coding using log-likelihood thresholding for cooperative communications","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057314S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074564,"authors":[{"name":"Ragnar Thobaben","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ragnar","lastName":"Thobaben","id":"37285065000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074564","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074564","abstract":"In this paper, we address the design of distributed coding schemes for the 3-node relay channel with half-duplex constraint.

However, due to the delay between evaluation of the channels at the terminals and application of the resource allocation decision, the concept operates conveniently only under quasi-static channel conditions. In case user terminals are moving, the channel may vary and thus the adaptive concept may suffer strong performance degradations. For a channel-adaptive transmission concept based on evaluation of SINR conditions, we propose a solution to predict future SINR conditions based on channel interpolation techniques. For a limited prediction interval depending on the receive antenna spacing, the technique significantly diminishes potential SINR losses.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074566","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074566.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting SINR conditions in mobile MIMO-OFDM systems by interpolation techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predicting SINR conditions in mobile MIMO-OFDM systems by interpolation techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074566/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719041","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074566/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting SINR conditions in mobile MIMO-OFDM systems by interpolation techniques","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10968S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5074567,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Ketseoglou","affiliation":["ECE Department, California Polytechnic State University, Pomona, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ketseoglou","id":"37300531400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074567","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Relays","Iterative decoding","Channel estimation","Least squares approximation","Delay","Diversity methods","Transceivers","Sensor systems","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","encoding","OFDM modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","iterative reception","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","repetition coding","iterative receiver","turbo processing","clipping distortion","channel estimation","node cooperation diversity"]}],"abstract":"A realistic model for OFDM cooperation diversity is presented for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems with clipping type of nonlinearities present. The destination node processes together the received information from the source node and a single relay one (if any of the candidate relays succeeds in decoding the original OFDM packet sent). The relayed packets are the same with the direct ones (repetition coding), so that simpler receiver processing applies. The destination node applies an iterative receiver structure based on Turbo processing, in which both the channels and the clipping distortion are (iteratively) estimated. The relaying nodes receive the source-node emanating packets in a standard, non-iterative fashion, due to delay constraints.

In the considered cellular hotspot scenario, a destination node receives superposition of single-hop transmission from a source node and two-hop transmissions via full-duplex relays. We propose a novel co-phasing scheme that results in significant coherent combining gain in the destination due to subcarrier phase rotation in the relays. In full-duplex relays, the phase rotation is achievable by time-domain baseband filtering.

Cooperation eliminates inter-cell interference and it enables a higher channel rank. The isolated cell capacity is an upper bound for unlimited backbone capacity, infinite signal processing power and infinite channel feedback.We discuss a combined physical, medium access control (MAC) and network layer approach targeting minimal implementation loss while relaxing assumptions. It is based on frequency-selective channel quality identifier (CQI) reports to the serving station selecting the right user(s) on a given resource with best signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR). Such scheduling is performed independently in each cell. In adjacent cells it forms a group of users whose mutual interference is smaller than on average. The task of cooperative transmission is to further reduce the mutual interference within this group. In a multi-user system, the group shares only part of the spectrum. Feedback can hence be limited to the granted resource blocks. Based on virtual pilot sequences we reduce the pilot overhead and use a suitable mirror feedback scheme in addition. Altogether the feedback overhead is reduced by 2 orders of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074569","startPage":"1035","endPage":"1039","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074569.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation concepts for distributed cooperative transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Implementation concepts for distributed cooperative transmission","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074569/","accessionNumber":"10719044","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074569/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation concepts for distributed cooperative transmission","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073104S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5074571,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The goal is to design an optimally efficient set of tests of items such that the test results contain enough information to determine a small subset of items of interest. It has its roots in the statistics community and was originally designed for the selective service during World War II to remove men with syphilis from the draft. It appears in many forms, including coin-weighing problems, experimental designs, and public health. We are interested in both the design of tests and the design of an efficient algorithm that works with the tests to determine the group of interest because many of the same techniques that are useful for designing tests are also used to solve algorithmic problems in compressive sensing, as well as to analyze and recover statistical quantities from streaming data. This article is an expository article, with the purpose of examining the relationship between group testing and compressive sensing, along with their applications and connections to sparse function learning.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074574.pdf","startPage":"1059","endPage":"1063","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group testing and sparse signal recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Algorithm design and analysis","Machine learning algorithms","Mathematics","Design for experiments","Compressed sensing","Signal design","Statistics","Public healthcare","Blood"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","signal processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group testing","sparse signal recovery","statistics community","selective service","coin-weighing problems","algorithmic problems","statistical quantities","sparse function learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Group testing and sparse signal recovery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074574/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719048","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group testing and sparse signal recovery","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042406S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074582,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang He","affiliation":["Wireless Communications and Networking Laboratory Electrical Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"He","id":"37311211700"},{"name":"Aylin Yener","affiliation":["Wireless Communications and Networking Laboratory Electrical Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Aylin","lastName":"Yener","id":"37273211500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074582","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Jamming","Upper bound","Bidirectional control","Degradation","Frequency","State feedback","Helium","Wireless communication","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","Gaussian channels","jamming","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-way secure communication","bidirectional communication","feedback","half-duplex Gaussian two-way relay channel","time sharing scheme","cooperative jamming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074582","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074582","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","abstract":"For bi-directional communication, the most general form of encoders should consider the signals received in the past as inputs. However, in practice, it would also be highly desirable if feedback could be ignored for encoding purposes since this would lead to a simple system design. In this work, we investigate the question of whether and how much loss in secrecy rate would be incurred, if such an approach were taken. To do so, we investigate the role of feedback in secrecy for two three-node two-way channel models. First, we show that feedback is indeed useful for a class of full-duplex two-way wire-tap channels. In this case, when feedback is ignored, the channel is equivalent to a Gaussian degraded relay channel with confidential messages to the relay. The usefulness of feedback is demonstrated by deriving an upper bound for this channel when feedback is ignored, and then proving that, when feedback is used, a secrecy rate higher than this upper bound is achievable. Secondly, we consider the half-duplex Gaussian two-way relay channel where there is an eavesdropper co-located with the relay node, and find that the impact of feedback is less pronounced compared to the previous scenario. Specifically, the loss in secrecy rate, when ignoring the feedback, is quantified to be less than 0.5 bit per channel use when the power of the relay goes to infinity. We also show that this rate region is achievable under a simple time sharing scheme with cooperative jamming, which, with its simplicity and near-optimum performance, is a viable alternative to an encoder using feedback.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"1093","endPage":"1097","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074582.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the role of feedback in two-way secure communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074582/","displayDocTitle":"On the role of feedback in two-way secure communication","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719054","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the role of feedback in two-way secure communication","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07512S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5074583,"authors":[{"name":"Bernd Bandemer","affiliation":["The Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Bandemer","id":"37394002300"},{"name":"Aydin Sezgin","affiliation":["The Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aydin","lastName":"Sezgin","id":"37284911800"},{"name":"Arogyaswami Paulraj","affiliation":["The Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arogyaswami","lastName":"Paulraj","id":"37278294900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074583","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian noise","Interference channels","Array signal processing","Transmitters","Upper bound","Propagation losses","Hydrogen","Sufficient conditions","Probability density function","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","interference (signal)","noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy interference regime","MISO","Gaussian interference channel","single-mode beamforming","practical decision algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074583","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074583","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","abstract":"In this work, we consider the two-user Gaussian MISO interference channel.

We study the design of linear precoders with probabilistically-constrained quality of service (QoS) requirements for each user, in scenarios with uncertain channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Our goal is to design the precoder so as to minimize the total transmitted power subject to the satisfaction of the QoS constraints with a maximum allowed outage probability. We consider two stochastic models for the uncertainty in the channel coefficients of each user. The first is a Gaussian model that is appropriate for uncertainty that results from estimation errors. The second one is uniform model that is appropriate for the quantization errors in systems with quantized feedback of channel state information. We formulate the design problem as a chance constrained optimization problem, in which each chance constraint involves randomly perturbed second order cone constraints. We adopt a conservative approach that yields (deterministic) convex and efficiently-solvable design formulations that guarantee the satisfaction of the probabilistic QoS constraints. Furthermore, based on these convex formulations, we propose computationally-efficient algorithms that can reduce the level of conservatism in the initial formulations. Our simulations indicate that the proposed methods can significantly expands the range of QoS requirements that can be satisfied in the presence of uncertainty in the CSI.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistically-constrained approaches to the design of the multiple antenna downlink","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074588","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074588.pdf","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistically-constrained approaches to the design of the multiple antenna downlink","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074588/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719059","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistically-constrained approaches to the design of the multiple antenna downlink","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052849S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074589,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Boccardi","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Boccardi","id":"37294661800"},{"name":"Howard Huang","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Howard","lastName":"Huang","id":"37289495000"},{"name":"Angeliki Alexiou","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Angeliki","lastName":"Alexiou","id":"37284629700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074589","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":384},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Base stations","Array signal processing","Downlink","Clustering algorithms","Round robin","Costs","Interference elimination","Data communication","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","array signal processing","cellular radio","MIMO communication","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network MIMO","reduced backhaul requirement","MAC coordination","network coordination","intercell interference","beamforming coefficient calculation"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of network coordination for reducing the intercell interference.

FEC decoder consists of mainly three components: control channel decoder, data channel decoder, and hybrid automatic repeat query (HARQ) combining. Control channel decoder is constrained by latency budget which impacts buffering as well as power management of modem signal processing chains. For WiMAX, both Viterbi and Turbo decoders are required to receive control channel while for LTE, only Viterbi decoder is required. For data-channel, a high-throughput Turbo decoder is required to support high data rate. HARQ combining is mainly dominated by memory size and bandwidth requirements given the maximum data rate, maximum number of HARQ processes and re-transmission formats. We analyze the requirements and discuss possible candidate architectures for three components.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074593.pdf","startPage":"1143","endPage":"1147","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward error correction decoding for WiMAX and 3GPP LTE modems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Decoding","WiMAX","Modems","Automatic control","Viterbi algorithm","Microwave generation","Long Term Evolution","Delay","Energy management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","forward error correction","turbo codes","Viterbi decoding","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction decoding","WiMAX","3GPP long term evolution modems","next generation wireless modems","worldwide interoperability for microwave access","third generation partnership project","control channel decoder","data channel decoder","hybrid automatic repeat query","viterbi decoders","turbo decoders","memory size","bandwidth requirements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long-Term Evolution","LTE","WiMAX","Turbo decoder","HARQ","Forward Error Correction","FEC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Forward error correction decoding for WiMAX and 3GPP LTE modems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074593/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719063","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward error correction decoding for WiMAX and 3GPP LTE modems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057753S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074594,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran K.

The result is lost tracks and deteriorated joint tracking performance. In this work, we design configurable waveforms and adjust the positioning of their ambiguity function (AF) sidelobes to unmask weak targets and improve tracking performance. To track multiple targets, we develop a tracker that is based on the likelihood particle filter and the independent partitions proposal method. The proposed independent partitions likelihood particle filter (IPLPF) accurately processes the high resolution measurements resulting from the use of Bjorck CAZAC sequences that we use to construct our configurable waveforms and tracks a fixed and known number of targets. We provide simulation results that demonstrate the improvement in tracking performance of multiple targets when using adaptively configured MCPC Bjorck CAZAC waveforms versus using non-adaptive configurations or single Bjorck CAZACs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074603.pdf","startPage":"1188","endPage":"1192","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple target tracking using particle filtering and adaptive waveform design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Adaptive filters","Filtering","Radar tracking","Particle tracking","Particle measurements","Particle filters","Delay","Design engineering","Electric variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle filtering (numerical methods)","radar tracking","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple target tracking","particle filtering","adaptive waveform design","weak target measurements","ambiguity function sidelobes","independent partitions proposal method","high resolution measurements","radar sensors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiple target tracking using particle filtering and adaptive waveform design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074603/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719071","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple target tracking using particle filtering and adaptive waveform design","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069657S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074628,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Chih Weng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ching-Chih","lastName":"Weng","id":"37403629300"},{"name":"P.

Because in practical implementations each antenna is limited individually by its equipped power amplifier, this paper adopts the more realistic per-antenna power constraints, in contrast to the conventional sum-power constraint on the transmitter antennas. Assuming perfect channel knowledge both at the transmitter and the receiver, the optimization problem can be transformed into a semi-definite program (SDP), which can be solved by convex optimization tools. Furthermore, several objective functions of the MIMO system, including average bit error rate, can also be optimized by the introduction of the majorization theory.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074628","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074628.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"1300","endPage":"1304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Per-antenna power constrained MIMO transceivers optimized for BER","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Per-antenna power constrained MIMO transceivers optimized for BER","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074628/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719092","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074628/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Per-antenna power constrained MIMO transceivers optimized for BER","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075701S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074631,"authors":[{"name":"Gonzalo Vazquez-Vilar","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gonzalo","lastName":"Vazquez-Vilar","id":"38276527500"},{"name":"Vinay Majjigi","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Majjigi","id":"37398242300"},{"name":"Aydin Sezgin","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aydin","lastName":"Sezgin","id":"37284911800"},{"name":"Arogyaswami Paulraj","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arogyaswami","lastName":"Paulraj","id":"37278294900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074631","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Array signal processing","Channel state information","Transmitters","State feedback","Block codes","Quality of service","Performance analysis","Information systems","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","diversity reception","MIMO communication","mobile communication","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback scheme","point-to-point MIMO systems","mobility","diversity scheme","channel state information","CSI","time duplexing","SNR","Doppler spread","beamforming","orthogonal space-time block coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO diversity","channel state information","fixed rate","feedback"]}],"abstract":"A MIMO diversity scheme that utilizes varying amounts of channel state information (CSI) for mobile users is presented.

The optimal feedback amount is shown to have a strong dependence on the user's average SNR and Doppler spread.

The PCI value is associated to a specific precoding vector that is applied to the transmit signal at the basestation. In this work, we derive analytic expressions for the post equalization SINR.

In order to alleviate this problem, resource bundling has been proposed. By applying the same precoding on a block (tile) of adjacent OFDM subcarriers, both the complexity of the system and the feedback overhead can be reduced significantly, at the cost of a slight performance degradation. In this paper, we consider the realistic situation where the available channel state information is noisy or inaccurate due to estimation errors or feedback delays. The robustness of the performance of a multi-user uplink system is studied for various tile sizes. We show that under channel uncertainty, optimal performance is no longer achieved with the smallest possible tile size. Thus, in this setting, tile-based processing achieves a performance gain, in addition to reducing complexity and overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074633","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074633.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"1326","endPage":"1329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tile-based MIMO OFDM systems: The impact of inaccurate channel state information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tile-based MIMO OFDM systems: The impact of inaccurate channel state information","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074633/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10719097","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074633/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tile-based MIMO OFDM systems: The impact of inaccurate channel state information","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059237S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5074635,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Jong Yang","affiliation":["Scientfic Computing Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun Jong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291243600"},{"name":"Joohwan Chun","affiliation":["Scientfic Computing Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joohwan","lastName":"Chun","id":"37272877200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074635","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","MIMO","Transmitters","Throughput","Matrix converters","Bit error rate","Maximum likelihood detection","Design methodology","Computer science","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz algorithm","lattice reduction","precoding system","channel condition","computational complexity","feedback system","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"It is well known that the lattice reduction (LR)-aided precoding system improves the channel condition and thereby the computational complexity at the mobile station can be dramatically reduced.

Fusion of multiple cues provides promises for improving the detection robustness, however has never been systematically studied before. By fusing multiple cues, the tampering detection process does not rely entirely on a single detector and hence can be robust in face of missing or unreliable detectors. In this paper, we propose a statistical fusion framework based on discriminative random fields (DRF) to integrate multiple cues suitable for forgery detection, such as double quantization artifacts and camera response function inconsistency. The detection results using individual cues are used as observation from which the DRF model parameters and the most likely node labels are inferred indicating whether a local block belongs to a tampered foreground or the authentic background. Such inference results also provide information about localization of the suspect spliced regions.

In addition, the design of the feedback channel for this scheme can be greatly simplified as no effort must be expended to combat the cross user interference. In this paper, we study the delay and throughput trade-offs for three specific schemes including generalized slotted ALOHA (GSA), repetition time diversity (RTD), and general incremental redundancy (INR). We also prove that when we increase the rate per packet linearly with K, we can obtain a linear scaling for both the throughput and the delay with respect to K.

In particular, we derive analytical bit error rate (BER) expressions for linearly dispersed full-rate DSTBCs characterized by a diversity order eta over the random set relay channel with arbitrary fading statistics per brach and assuming constant average transmit power per relay. The system concept is interesting in which no coordination amongst relays is required, and only backward channel state information (CSI) is assumed. Employing the formulae with eta = 1 so as to capture the performance of ideal (full-rate-full-diversity) codes, we then study the BER performance of AF-DSTBCs over the RSRC with Rayleigh fading per link. The analysis reveals that a substantial gain in spectrum efficient, and surprisingly even some improvement in raw BER, are achieved by the autonomic relaying mechanism, compared to the alternative of full-time all-relay cooperation, despite the fact that the total receive power at destination increases with the number K of active relays. Finally, we complement the analytical findings with simulation results employing the GABBA codes that corroborates the analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074662/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718712","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of amplify-and-forward DSTBCs over the random set relay channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of amplify-and-forward DSTBCs over the random set relay channel","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA","sourcePdf":"0001457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052685S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5074665,"authors":[{"name":"Steven W.

The relays need not even decode the signal in order to aid the transmission. Multi-antenna relays, in particular, may apply a linear transfer matrix to improve transmission while maintaining a simple design. The usage of multiple antennas, however, raises questions about which of the multitude of transmission strategies should be used for a given channel realization. In this paper, the use of pre-existing adaptation techniques is shown to be inapplicable to the linear MIMO relay channel, motivating the derivation of new techniques. To simplify the task, the source is limited to transmitting using either spatial multiplexing with no channel state information, or antenna selection based on a limited amount of feedback from the destination. Transmission is assumed to be fixed-rate and adaptation is based on minimizing the symbol error rate. A sufficient condition for multiplexing to outperform antenna selection is derived and, out of this, a value that behaves as an effective condition number of the relay channel is found.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074665","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074665.pdf","startPage":"1469","endPage":"1473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching between antenna selection and spatial multiplexing in the nonregenerative MIMO relay channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074665/","displayDocTitle":"Switching between antenna selection and spatial multiplexing in the nonregenerative MIMO relay channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718714","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074665/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching between antenna selection and spatial multiplexing in the nonregenerative MIMO relay channel","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048307S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5074666,"authors":[{"name":"Deniz Gunduz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Deniz","lastName":"Gunduz","id":"37284016000"},{"name":"Andrea Goldsmith","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Goldsmith","id":"37269021300"},{"name":"H.

Assuming independent quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels and channel state information available at the receivers, we characterize the optimal diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) curve for a full-duplex relay terminal. It is shown that the optimal DMT can be achieved by a compress-and-forward type relaying strategy in which the relay quantizes its received signal and transmits the corresponding channel codeword. It is noteworthy that, with this transmission protocol, the two transmissions in opposite directions can achieve their respective single user optimal DMT performances simultaneously, despite the interference they cause to each other. Motivated by the optimality of this scheme in the case of the two-way relay channel, a novel dynamic compress-and-forward (DCF) protocol is proposed for the one-way multi-hop MIMO relay channel for a half-duplex relay terminal, and this scheme is shown to achieve the optimal DMT performance.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074666","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074666.pdf","startPage":"1474","endPage":"1478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO two-way relay channel: Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074666/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO two-way relay channel: Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718715","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074666/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO two-way relay channel: Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff analysis","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06875S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074667,"authors":[{"name":"Anders Host-Madsen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Host-Madsen","id":"37284887100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074667","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Relays","Decoding","Wireless networks","Upper bound","Random variables","Electronic mail","Channel capacity","Entropy","Antenna theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic capacity","MIMO relay networks","reliable information transmission","relay channel","network capacity"]}],"abstract":"The deterministic capacity of a relay network is the capacity of a network when relays are restricted to transmitting reliable information, that is, (asymptotically) deterministic function of the source message.

We characterize the achievable rate regions with optimum TD strategies between the two phases for the following two cases: one is under peak power constraint and the other is under average power constraint. The simulation results show that the achievable rate regions with optimum TD strategies are much larger than those with equal TD strategy.

The FEC coding gain can be employed to lower the power consumed in the analog components (e.g., transmit driver, clock recovery unit (CRU)) since these do not scale with process technology. A BER improvement of six orders-of-magnitude and ten orders-of-magnitude is demonstrated for a 20\" FR4 channel operating at 10 Gb/s with a LE and a DFE, respectively, using a BCH code. Savings in the encoder-decoder power overhead of up to 50% is demonstrated for a (63, 36, 11) BCH code using a novel gated decoder architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward error correction for high-speed I/O","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074674","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074674.pdf","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Forward error correction for high-speed I/O","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074674/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718722","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward error correction for high-speed I/O","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072458S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5074675,"authors":[{"name":"Xinmiao Zhang","affiliation":["Case Western Reserve University, USA"],"firstName":"Xinmiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279339400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074675","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Reed-Solomon codes","Interpolation","Variable speed drives","Polynomials","Hardware","Iterative decoding","Digital communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","polynomial approximation","Reed-Solomon codes","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSi architecture design","algebraic soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","coding gain","polynomial complexity","algebraic interpolation process"]}],"abstract":"Reed-Solomon (RS) codes have very broad applications in digital communication and storage systems. The recently developed algebraic soft-decision decoding (ASD) algorithms of RS codes have caught much attention. These algorithms can achieve substantial coding gain with polynomial complexity by incorporating the reliability information from the channel into an algebraic interpolation process. ASD algorithms have two major steps: the interpolation and factorization. This paper first gives a review of available algorithms that can be used for the implementation of these steps. Particularly, we focus on the Nielson's and Lee-O'Sullivan algorithms for the interpolation and the Roth-Ruckenstein algorithm for the factorization. Then hardware implementation bottlenecks of these algorithms are outlined, and existing efforts on VLSI architecture design for these algorithms are discussed. In addition, implementation results and comparisons are provided.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074675","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074675.pdf","startPage":"1518","endPage":"1522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSi architecture design for algebraic soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"VLSi architecture design for algebraic soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074675/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10718723","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074675/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSi architecture design for algebraic soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086821S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5074676,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbin Sun","affiliation":["Institute of AI&R, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596251500"},{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292032900"},{"name":"Nanning Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of AI&R, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Nanning","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37271536700"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074676","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074676","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Switches","Humans","Eyes","Frequency","Motion estimation","Computational modeling","Computational complexity","PSNR","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","motion adaptive deinterlacing","real-time video processing","human eyes","slow-moving objects","computational complexity","PSNR"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a low-complexity motion compensation (MC) aided motion adaptive (MA) de-interlacing method, aiming at effectively leveraging the fact human eyes are not sensitive to high spatial frequency with rapid motion.

Compared with conventional MC de-interlacing, the motion estimation only needs to search in a much smaller area and can adaptively switch between the same parity and opposite parity fields according to the motion vector. Simulation demonstrates that the proposed method only incurs less than 5% of computational complexity of general MC de-interlacing, and meanwhile can improve the PSNR by up to 10 dB compared with conventional MA methods.

The focus will be on providing ad-hoc multihop access to a network for device to device users, that are transparent to the primary wireless cellular network, while sharing the primary network's resources.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074679","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074679.pdf","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular networks with an overlaid device to device network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074679/","displayDocTitle":"Cellular networks with an overlaid device to device network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718742","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074679/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular networks with an overlaid device to device network","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.172743S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5074683,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Saul","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Saul","id":"37419477300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074683","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074683","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Admission control","File servers","Streaming media","Media Access Protocol","Channel state information","Constraint optimization","Equations","Game theory","Land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","radio networks","resource allocation","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless resource allocation","perceived quality fairness","cross-layer optimization","application layer","link layer","wireless radio resource allocation","optimization criterion","differentiated services","admission control"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless resource allocation with perceived quality fairness","startPage":"1557","endPage":"1561","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074683.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074683","abstract":"We address cross-layer optimization (CLO) between link and application layer.

However, much of the literature concerning estimation for communications processes, such as QAM signals, is based upon Cartesian coordinate representations and approximated dynamics, subsequently amenable to the extended Kalman filter (EKF). This common approach, using EKFs, is well known to be unstable, for example, in demodulating a QAM signal, one must first estimate timing information. If this information is uncertain, then EKFs can fail profoundly. In this article we compute a general recursive filter for the QAM family of communications signals. This filter is exact and can be configured for any of the standard classes of circular distributions, such as, for example, the von Mises distribution of the wrapped normal distribution. Our filter is computed by using the techniques of reference probability resulting in a recursion in terms of un-normalised probability densities.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074708","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074708.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal processing","Timing","Gaussian distribution","Digital communication","Stochastic processes","Filtering","White noise","Signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","digital communication","Kalman filters","quadrature amplitude modulation","recursive filters","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive filter","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","circular stochastic processes","extended Kalman filter","von Mises distribution","reference probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear Filtering","Discrete-Time","Circular Processes","Reference Probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An exact recursive filter for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation dynamics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074708/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074708/","accessionNumber":"10718782","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An exact recursive filter for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation dynamics","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040692S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074717,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid R.

We assume noncoherent reception at the fusion center (FC) with a training based channel estimator which estimates amplitude of the channels between the sensors and the FC. We derive the likelihood-ratio-test (LRT) fusion rule that incorporates the channel amplitude estimates when the sensors use OOK or orthogonal modulations (e.g., binary FSK, binary PPM) to modulate their binary local decisions. We also derive a suboptimal fusion rule that approximates the LRT at low SNR. We study the effect of channel amplitude estimation error on the system performance with noncoherent reception using optimal and suboptimal fusion rules in the fusion center. As a benchmark we compare it with a fusion rule that assumes perfect channel amplitude information is available in the FC. Performance evaluation shows that as SNR increases the channel estimation error decreases and the performance of the rules converges to the performance of the corresponding rules with perfect channel amplitude at the FC.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074717.pdf","startPage":"1709","endPage":"1712","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074717","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074717","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074717","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Sensor fusion","Amplitude estimation","Light rail systems","Wireless sensor networks","Amplitude modulation","Sensor systems","Fading","Sensor phenomena and characterization","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","channel estimation","distributed sensors","diversity reception","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation error","distributed detection systems","Rayleigh fading channels","fusion center","likelihood-ratio-test","OOK","orthogonal modulations","SNR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074717/","displayDocTitle":"On the effect of channel estimation error upon the performance of distributed detection systems","accessionNumber":"10718791","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074717/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the effect of channel estimation error upon the performance of distributed detection systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090505S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5074719,"authors":[{"name":"Radoslaw Mazur","affiliation":["Institute for Signal Processing, University of L\u00fcbeck, Lubeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Radoslaw","lastName":"Mazur","id":"37626767400"},{"name":"Alfred Mertins","affiliation":["Institute for Signal Processing, University of L\u00fcbeck, Lubeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Mertins","id":"37271261500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074719","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Time frequency analysis","Signal processing","Reverberation","Finite impulse response filter","Independent component analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Source separation","Acoustic distortion","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","convolution","independent component analysis","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["separation performance enhancement","convolutive blind source separation","bin-wise separation performance","convolutive mixtures","instantaneous ICA algorithm","permutation problem","unmixing matrices"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a method for estimating the bin-wise separation performance in convolutive blind source separation. A common way to separate convolutive mixtures is the transformation to the time-frequency domain and the separation of the single bins using an instantaneous ICA algorithm. This approach reduces the complexity but leads to the so-called permutation problem which has been widely studied. Another problem arises when the single bins are only poorly separable or even not separable at all. These bins can significantly reduce the overall performance.

For rates higher than one, the resulting space-time codes are simultaneously lower in decoding complexity and better performing than all known previous constructions in terms of the error probability achieved on a quasistatic Rayleigh fading channel with a given dimension.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074726","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074726.pdf","startPage":"1749","endPage":"1753","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded Alamouti space-time codes for high rate and low decoding complexity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Embedded Alamouti space-time codes for high rate and low decoding complexity","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074726/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718817","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074726/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded Alamouti space-time codes for high rate and low decoding complexity","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057429S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5074727,"authors":[{"name":"Abdellatif Salah","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Abdellatif","lastName":"Salah","id":"37865842100"},{"name":"Ghaya Rekaya Ben Othman","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Ghaya Rekaya Ben","lastName":"Othman"},{"name":"Rym Ouertani","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Rym","lastName":"Ouertani","id":"37407916100"},{"name":"Samuel Guillouard","affiliation":["Thomson Corporate Research Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9 France, France"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Guillouard","id":"37936150500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074727","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074727","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Costs","Lattices","Equations","Receiving antennas","Antennas and propagation","Transmitters","Detectors","Concatenated codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft stack decoder","MIMO channel","soft output decoders","linear channels","multiple input multiple output systems","MIMO decoder","hard stack decoder","LLR","log-likelihood ratio value"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the use of soft output decoders for signals transmitted on linear channels when applied to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems.

The proposed decoder is based on a phase descent search (PDS) algorithm. The PDS algorithm is based on coordinate descent iterations and constraints elements of the solution to have unit magnitudes. In the MPD, the PDS algorithm is used multiple times with different initializations. The solution from the PDS algorithm with the minimum cost is chosen as the final solution of the proposed decoder. Simulation results show that, for QPSK modulation, the proposed decoder can approach the performance of the Maximum Likelihood decoder. Comparing to the sphere decoder, the MPD offers a lower complexity, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios and with a large number of transmit antennas. Thus the proposed decoder may be regarded as an alternative to the sphere decoder for MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple phase decoder for MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074728","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074728.pdf","startPage":"1759","endPage":"1762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiple phase decoder for MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074728/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718819","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple phase decoder for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094572S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074731,"authors":[{"name":"Adam R.

The LSD consists of three different parts: the preprocessing unit, the LSD algorithm unit and the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation unit. Architecture design is the key point to enable an efficient implementation of the LSD. In this paper, we design the architecture for the whole detector structure and exploit the parallelism and pipelining possibilities of the presented architecture units.

The LSD is also shown to be feasible for practical implementation, and the implementation complexity and latency results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074749","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074749.pdf","startPage":"1852","endPage":"1856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation and complexity analysis of list sphere detector for MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074749/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and complexity analysis of list sphere detector for MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718855","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074749/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and complexity analysis of list sphere detector for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001852.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075649S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074754,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598336200"},{"name":"Yuriy Zakharov","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Yuriy","lastName":"Zakharov","id":"37271562300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074754","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Field programmable gate arrays","Resonance light scattering","Filtering algorithms","Adaptive filters","Adaptive arrays","Adaptive algorithm","Equations","Least squares methods","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","field programmable gate arrays","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RLS-DCD algorithm","FPGA","recursive least squares adaptive filtering","dichotomous coordinate descent iteration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filter","antenna beamforming","dichotomous coordinate descent","DCD iterations","FPGA","RLS","regularization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an FPGA implementation of a dynamically regularized recursive least squares adaptive filtering algorithm based on dichotomous coordinate descent iterations.

It is known that the offset MS decoding algorithm is implemented with simplified hardware complexity and achieves good decoding performance. However, the finite precision effects in decoding LDPC codes result in performance different from floating point. The performance degradation is caused by different dynamic ranges of input data at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed offset MS algorithm uses the received data directly instead of log-likelihood ratio (LLR) data as the intrinsic information. It can achieve better performance than the conventional one since its offset factor is more effective at a wide range of SNR and the intrinsic information is quantized more robustly since it is independent of channel information. Also, it is possible for the proposed scheme to use a same quantization scheme for a flexible LDPC decoder, which can decode several kinds of LDPC codes. Simulation results show that our optimally quantized offset MS algorithms with 5-bits for (1728, 864) and (1728, 1296) irregular LDPC codes achieve better performance compared with the conventional offset MS algorithms with 6-bits quantization scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074756/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10718862","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074756/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimally quantized offset min-sum algorithm for flexible LDPC decoder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimally quantized offset min-sum algorithm for flexible LDPC decoder","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001886.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059315S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5074757,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37291598300"},{"name":"Joseph R.

Instead of using the traditional tree topology, we represent the search space of the MIMO signals with a fully connected trellis and a forward-backward recursion is applied to compute the a posteriori probability (APP) for each coded data bit. The proposed detector has the following advantages: (a) it keeps a fixed throughput and has a regular datapath structure which makes it amenable to VLSI implementation, and (b) it attempts to maximize the a posteriori probability by tracing both forward and backward on the trellis and it always ensures that at least one candidate exists for every possible transmitted bit x\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sub>\n isin {-1, +1}.

As a result, the entire space from which signal may be received must be finely sampled, requiring a model of very large scale and computational complexity. We have developed a method that uses a reduced rank formulation of a subset of the hypothetical source locations to reduce the computational complexity of dTONE by several orders of magnitude with minimal degradation in image quality.

The fusion center combines the incoming sensor decisions and reaches a final decision about the absence or presence of the event. For binary sensor decisions, determination of the local sensor decision thresholds is crucial. In this paper, we evaluate the set of local sensor thresholds through multi-objective optimization where the probability of error and the total energy consumption of the network are optimized simultaneously. The optimal threshold sets are generated by using a mathematical programming Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) method and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm Non Dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II).

However, most OFDM analyses assume idealized conditions when it comes to the waveform characteristics at the receiver. A cyclic prefix (CP) duration longer than the channel delay spread, and perfect time/frequency synchronization at the receiver makes the OFDM system appear as a set of N parallel orthogonal flat fading channels, where N is the number of subcarriers in the OFDM system. This work investigates how this subcarrier orthogonality is lost when we consider common imperfections such as a channel delay spread longer than the CP, and imperfect time/frequency synchronization at the receiver. We quantify the impact of these imperfections into the receiver bit error rate (BER) and we specialize the analysis to various UWB applications. From the analyses, we see graceful performance degradation with decreasing CP length and increasing residual frequency error. The performance degradation can be much more critical for timing synchronization errors.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074779","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074779.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"1985","endPage":"1989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of imperfections on the performance of OFDM-based UWB systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of imperfections on the performance of OFDM-based UWB systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074779/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718899","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074779/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of imperfections on the performance of OFDM-based UWB systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001985.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043139S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074784,"authors":[{"name":"Man-On Pun","affiliation":["Princeton University, USA","Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Man-On","lastName":"Pun","id":"37296526500"},{"name":"Kyeong Jin Kim","affiliation":["Nokia, Inc., Irving, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kyeong Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280262200"},{"name":"Ronald Iltis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Iltis","id":"37296980900"},{"name":"H.

It has been demonstrated that significant feedback reduction can be achieved by returning information about only one beamforming matrix (BFM) for all subcarriers from each MT, compared to one BFM for each subcarrier in the conventional schemes. However, since the previously proposed channel decomposition was derived based on singular value decomposition, the resulting system performance is impaired by the subchannels associated with the smallest singular values. To circumvent this obstacle, this work proposes improved opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes based on geometric mean decomposition-based channel decomposition. In addition to the inherent advantage in reduced feedback, the proposed schemes can achieve improved system performance by decomposing the MIMO channels into spatial subchannels with more evenly distributed channel gains. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074784","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074784.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"2009","endPage":"2013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-feedback opportunistic scheduling and beamforming with GMD for MIMO-OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-feedback opportunistic scheduling and beamforming with GMD for MIMO-OFDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074784/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718921","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074784/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-feedback opportunistic scheduling and beamforming with GMD for MIMO-OFDMA","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0002009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075072S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074785,"authors":[{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37281000600"},{"name":"Zhongshan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhongshan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279639900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074785","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":164},"abstract":"We evaluate the performance improvement in orthogonal frequency-division multiplex access (OFDMA) achievable with cooperative relaying in the presence of frequency offsets.

In each transmission, node S has M relays when transmitting its own signal, and it also helps the other M relays transmit their signals. The total power used to transmit each symbol, including the power consumed in S and the relays, is kept constant. The outage information rates of the proposed cooperative transmission scheme are first derived. The performance improvement in the frequency offset estimation by using cooperative relay is then analyzed. Channel estimation in a cooperative OFDMA network in the presence of frequency offsets is also evaluated, and the pairwise error probability (PEP) of orthogonal space-time coding in cooperative OFDMA due to both the frequency offset and channel estimation errors is derived. Numerical results illustrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme over the conventional transmission with regard to outage information rate, frequency offset estimation error and the PEP.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074785.pdf","startPage":"2014","endPage":"2018","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDMA based cooperative relay networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Frequency estimation","Channel estimation","Information rates","Frequency diversity","Frequency synchronization","Frequency division multiplexing","Decoding","Diversity reception","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","frequency estimation","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative relay networks","orthogonal frequency-division multiplex access","amplify-and-forward mode","decode-and-forward mode","signal transmission","cooperative transmission","frequency offset estimation","channel estimation","cooperative OFDMA network","pairwise error probability","orthogonal space-time coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"OFDMA based cooperative relay networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074785/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718922","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDMA based cooperative relay networks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0002014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066539S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074786,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Xia","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Xia","id":"37281874800"},{"name":"Su-Khiong Yong","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Su-Khiong","lastName":"Yong","id":"37574788900"},{"name":"Jisung Oh","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jisung","lastName":"Oh","id":"38184105800"},{"name":"Chiu Ngo","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chiu","lastName":"Ngo","id":"37287884600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074786","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":890},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074786","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Millimeter wave communication","Array signal processing","Access protocols","Radio frequency","Transceivers","Millimeter wave technology","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","array signal processing","millimetre wave propagation","space division multiple access","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDMA protocol","millimeter wave communication","spatial division multiple access","optimal transmit beamforming vector","optimal receive beamforming vector","iterative antenna training protocol"]}],"abstract":"We study spatial division multiple access in 60 GHz millimeter wave communications and focus on estimation of the optimal transmit beamforming vectors for stations and optimal receive beamforming vectors for the access point.

We initially develop and analyze the STR framework in a point-to-point system which serves as a foundation and benchmark for multiuser scenarios. We also investigate an iterative STR scheme and discuss its connections to communication on the eigen modes of the space-time channel. We then explore the applicability of STR techniques in a multiuser setting, both in the broadcast and multiple-access modes. We present an initial set of observations on the convergence of the iterative STR technique in multiuser scenarios and using insights obtained in the single user setting, we propose and compare two different signaling mechanisms for multiuser systems that reliably separate the transmissions to/from different users. The relevant metrics in all the above scenarios are quantified analytically and illustrated with realistic simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time reversal techniques for wideband MIMO communication","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074790","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074790.pdf","startPage":"2038","endPage":"2042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Space-time reversal techniques for wideband MIMO communication","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074790/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718926","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time reversal techniques for wideband MIMO communication","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0002038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070826S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074791,"authors":[{"name":"Dayu Huang","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Dayu Huang","id":"37534334200"},{"name":"Vasanthan Raghavan","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Vasanthan","lastName":"Raghavan","id":"37285687800"},{"name":"Ada S.

However, attention has shifted to the 60 GHz regime where the opening up of the spectrum has created new opportunities for multi-antenna communications. With a broad focus on the 60 GHz regime, we revisit MIMO channel modeling in the classical setting and propose an angular domain decomposition of the channel in this work. In the special case of non-uniform linear arrays, this proposal corresponds to non-uniformly partitioning the angular domain commensurate with the non-uniformity structure of the arrays and estimating the channel gains in each partition with a multi-window spectral estimator. We show that the optimal choice of basis functions that minimize the worst-case bias of the spectral estimator are solutions to certain generalized eigenvalue problems. Based on this structure, we develop a spatial model that generalizes existing MIMO channel modeling paradigms.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074791","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074791.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Angular domain processing for MIMO wireless systems with non-uniform antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Angular domain processing for MIMO wireless systems with non-uniform antenna arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074791/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718927","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5074791/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angular domain processing for MIMO wireless systems with non-uniform antenna arrays","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0002043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055025S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5074792,"authors":[{"name":"Waheed U.

Traditional training-based methods, often comprising of maximum likelihood estimators, are known to be optimal under the assumption of rich multipath channels. Numerous measurement campaigns have shown, however, that physical multipath channels exhibit a sparse structure in angle-delay-Doppler, especially at large signal space dimensions. In this paper, key ideas from the emerging theory of compressed sensing are leveraged to: (i) propose new methods for efficient estimation of sparse multi-antenna channels, and (ii) show that explicitly accounting for multipath sparsity in channel estimation can result in significant performance improvements when compared with existing training-based methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074792","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074792.pdf","startPage":"2048","endPage":"2052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing of wireless channels in time, frequency, and space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074792/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing of wireless channels in time, frequency, and space","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718928","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074792/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing of wireless channels in time, frequency, and space","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0002048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088651S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5074793,"authors":[{"name":"Waleed Al-Hanafy","affiliation":["Centre for Excellence in Signal & Image Processing, Department of EEE, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK","Electronics & Communications Engineering Department Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Menoufia University, Menouf, Egypt"],"firstName":"Waleed","lastName":"Al-Hanafy","id":"38261037900"},{"name":"Andrew P.

Physical layer concepts as e.g. interference rejection combining, optimize the receiver side and thus strengthen the signal while combating the interference at the terminal side only. It is well known that joint transceiver optimization, i.e. coordinated joint transmission from several base stations, yields large capacity improvement for downlink transmission. However, the performance highly depends on the available channel knowledge. We focus on how to realize a decentralized and limited cooperative downlink transmission in a multi-cellular network. This yields the crucial question: Is an efficient cooperative transmission possible by using simple channel quality identifiers, or is channel state information at the transmitter mandatory? Further, we use minimum mean square error equalization at the terminal side to combat residual cochannel interference. For baseline we apply receiver optimization only and compare these results with those obtained from cooperative transmission. We demonstrate potential capacity gains in a cellular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system and their scaling with the number of cooperating antenna arrays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative multi-user MIMO based on limited feedback in downlink OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074795","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074795.pdf","startPage":"2063","endPage":"2067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative multi-user MIMO based on limited feedback in downlink OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5074795/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718931","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative multi-user MIMO based on limited feedback in downlink OFDM systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0002063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075909S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5074799,"authors":[{"name":"Alper Ucar","affiliation":["Applied DSP and VLSI Research Group, University of Westminster, London, UK"],"firstName":"Alper","lastName":"Ucar","id":"37927776600"},{"name":"Ediz Cetin","affiliation":["Applied DSP and VLSI Research Group, University of Westminster, London, UK"],"firstName":"Ediz","lastName":"Cetin","id":"37271256000"},{"name":"Izzet Kale","affiliation":["Applied DSP and VLSI Research Group, University of Westminster, London, UK"],"firstName":"Izzet","lastName":"Kale","id":"37273684900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2940-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2941-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"5074799","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5074799","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog-digital conversion","Sampling methods","Satellite navigation systems","Image sampling","Wideband","Software standards","Dynamic range","Power dissipation","Band pass filters","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","radio receivers","satellite navigation","signal sampling","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog-to-digital conversion","variable-rate bandpass sampling","GNSS receivers","radionavigation signals","software-defined wideband receiver","power dissipation","analog mixers","image-rejection filters","signal chain noise analysis"]}],"abstract":"As radionavigation signals will be in multiple bands within the next decade, a software-defined wideband receiver will enable painless tuning into the bands of interest to comply with the required modulation standard. Nevertheless, such a receiver puts extreme requirements on the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) in terms of sampling rate, dynamic range, and power dissipation such that a feasibly conceivable solution will not be available in the near future. An alternative solution is to utilize a variable-rate BandPass Sampling (BPS) receiver to relax the requirements of the ADC whilst eliminating the need for analog mixers and image-rejection filters. This paper first introduces the variable-rate BPS GNSS receiver and then gives an analysis of SNR degradation due to various noise sources and presents design considerations for the proposed receiver. A comparative study is carried out for Flash ADC and Continuous-Time (CT) Delta-Sigma (DeltaSigma) ADC as well as providing a signal chain noise analysis for both cases.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5074342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074799","publicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5061475/5074342/05074799.pdf","startPage":"2081","endPage":"2085","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the implications of Analog-to-Digital Conversion on variable-rate BandPass Sampling GNSS receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the implications of Analog-to-Digital Conversion on variable-rate BandPass Sampling GNSS receivers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5074799/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10718951","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5074799/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the implications of Analog-to-Digital Conversion on variable-rate BandPass Sampling GNSS receivers","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0002081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049668S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5061475","isNumber":"5074342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5061475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5074342","articleId":"5074799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5074802,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Yang Liu","id":"37292032900"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Tong Zhang","id":"37273954300"},{"name":"Keshab K.

A cyclic prefix should be as long as the channel impulse response (channel delay spread) to combat inter symbol interference (ISI). If this requirement is not met, a channel shortening equalizer is used to shorten the channel. In time varying channels, it is more sensible to use an adaptive channel shortener. In literature, adaptive channel shorteners and frequency domain equalizers (FEQ) have been well studied. But on the other hand, in wireless communication systems the performance metric is the bit error rate (BER) and minimizing the BER is the primary concern of the designing a system.

As a result, many researchers have fallen back on suboptimal heuristic algorithms. In a recent paper, we demonstrate that ergodic rate maximization is possible using a dual optimization framework that results in a practically optimal solution with complexity that is on the order of the number of subcarriers times the number of users. One of the primary disadvantages of considering ergodic rates is the assumption that the channel distribution information (CDI) is perfectly known at the transmitter. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive algorithm based on stochastic approximation methods that do not require knowledge of the CDI. This algorithm converges to the optimal solution with probability one, while for each OFDMA symbol, the complexity is on the order of the number of subcarriers times the number of users. There are no iterations in a given OFDMA symbol time; instead, the ldquoiterationsrdquo are actually performed across time (symbols).

The filter weights are designed to optimize the contrast resolution performance of the imaging system. Although the FIR beamformer offers significant gains in contrast resolution, the beamformer suffers from low sensitivity, and its performance rapidly degrades in the presence of noise. In this paper, a new method is presented to improve the robustness of the FIR beamformer to electronic noise as well as variation or uncertainty in the array response. A method is also described that controls the sidelobe levels of the FIR beamformer's spatial response by applying an arbitrary weighting function in the filter design algorithm. The robust FIR beamformer is analyzed using a generalized cystic resolution metric that quantifies a beamformer's clinical imaging performance as a function of cyst size and channel input SNR. Fundamental performance limits are compared between 2 robust FIR beamformer's the dynamic focus FIR (DF-FIR) beamformer and the group focus FIR (GF-FIR) beamformer-the conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer, and the spatial-matched filter (SMF) beamformer. Results from this study show that the new DF- and GF-FIR beamformers are more robust to electronic noise compared with the optimal contrast resolution FIR beamformer. Furthermore, the added robustness comes with only a slight loss in cystic resolution. Results from the generalized cystic resolution metric show that a 9-tap robust FIR beamformer outperforms the SMF and DAS beamformer until receive channel input SNR drops below -5 dB, whereas the 9-tap optimal contrast resolution beamformer's performance deteriorates around 50 dB SNR. The effects of moderate phase aberrations, characterized by an a priori root-mean-square strength of 28 ns and an a priori full-width at half-maximum correlation length of 3.6 mm, are investigated on the robust FIR beamformers. Full sets of robust FIR beamformer filter weights are constructed using an in silico model scanner and the L14-5/38 mm probe. Using the derived weights, a series of simulated point target and anechoic cyst B-mode images are generated to investigate further the potential increases in contrast resolution when using the robust FIR beamformers. Under the investigated conditions, the 7-tap optimal contrast resolution beamformer and the 7-tap robust beamformer with added SNR constraint increase lesion detectability by 247 and 137% compared with the conventional DAS beamformer, respectively. Finally, experimental phantom and in vivo images are produced using this novel receive architecture. The simulated and experimental images clearly show a reduction in clutter and an increase in contrast resolution compared with the conventionally beamformed images. This novel receive beamformer can be applied to any conventional ultrasound system where the system response is reasonably well characterized.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5075086/05075100.pdf","startPage":"1168","endPage":"1188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075086","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust finite impulse response beamforming applied to medical ultrasound","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Ultrasonic imaging","Finite impulse response filter","Noise robustness","Image resolution","Spatial resolution","Focusing","Biomedical imaging","Design optimization","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aberrations","biomedical equipment","biomedical ultrasonics","clutter","FIR filters","image resolution","image scanners","mean square error methods","medical image processing","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust finite impulse response beamforming","medical ultrasound in vivo images","channel-unique finite impulse response","FIR beamformer filter","robust FIR beamformer","spatial-matched filter","optimal contrast resolution FIR beamformer","SMF beamformer","DAS beamformer","delay-and-sum beamformer","generalized cystic resolution","channel input signal-to-noise ratio","9-tap optimal contrast resolution beamformer's performance","moderate phase aberration","root-mean-square method","half-maximum correlation","in silico model scanner","anechoic cyst B-mode image","simulated point target","experimental phantom","clutter reduction","7-tap robust beamformer","beamformer clinical imaging performance"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust finite impulse response beamforming applied to medical ultrasound","volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5075100/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10705177","pubMedId":"19574125","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust finite impulse response beamforming applied to medical ultrasound","sourcePdf":"t0961168.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128438S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5075086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5075086","articleId":"5075100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5075114,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Basarab","affiliation":["University of Lyon, CREATIS-LRMN, CNRS UMR 5220;

(1) Even on open-circuit, the low harmonic component (e.g. 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nd</sup>\n for 10-pole/12-slot machine, and 1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">st</sup>\n for 8-pole/9-slot machine) of radial force exists due to slotting effect although the amplitude is relatively low, while the slotless analytical model cannot predict this phenomenon; (2) However, on load, slotless analytical model is accurate enough in the radial force analysis, since in this case, the low order harmonic component of radial force is mainly due to the interaction between the magnet field and the armature reaction field, and is largely determined by the combination of pole and slot numbers; (3) It is much more reliable to calculate the radial force in the middle of airgap, rather than close to the stator bore, while the harmonic contents of radial force are almost independent of radius in the airgap; (4) The simple formula accounts only for the radial field component in the middle of airgap is accurate enough for radial force calculation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic analysis","Analytical models","Finite element methods","Permanent magnets","Brushless machines","Stators","Permanent magnet machines","Harmonic analysis","Armature","Boring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air gaps","brushless machines","permanent magnet machines","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial vibration force","fractional-slot permanent magnet brushless machines","finite element analysis","stator slotting","slotless analytical model","magnet field","armature reaction field","air gap"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075197","startPage":"144","endPage":"151","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069086/5075166/05075197.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical modelling and finite element computation of radial vibration force in fractional-slot permanent magnet brushless machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analytical modelling and finite element computation of radial vibration force in fractional-slot permanent magnet brushless machines","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10729033","publicationDate":"May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075197/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical modelling and finite element computation of radial vibration force in fractional-slot permanent magnet brushless machines","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"023_IEMDC2009-10982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069938S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":5075199,"authors":[{"name":"Leopoldo Cordova","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Leopoldo","lastName":"Cordova","id":"37529827800"},{"name":"Cesar Silva","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Cesar","lastName":"Silva","id":"37275249100"},{"name":"Pablo Lezana","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Lezana","id":"37294012000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4251-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4252-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5075199","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":477},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Pulse width modulation","Topology","Medium voltage","Power system harmonics","Power generation","Harmonic distortion","Reactive power","Switching frequency","Switching loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","invertors","pulse width modulation","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid multilevel inverter drive","current waveform improvement","multilevel topology","neutral point clamped","floating H-Bridge","reactive power","switching frequency","synchronous optimal pulsewidth modulation","induction motor drive","induction machine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid multilevel inverter drive with synchronous modulation and current waveform improvement","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075199","startPage":"158","endPage":"164","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069086/5075166/05075199.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075199","abstract":"The use of multilevel converters is widespread in medium-voltage applications due to their inherent capability to share the voltage between the power devices. More than one multilevel topology can be combined to form a single Hybrid Converter with improved capabilities. In particular, the series connection of a neutral point clamped (NPC) as a main inverter, providing the active power, and a floating H-Bridge in each phase as conditioning inverters is analyzed in this paper. The function of these conditioning inverters is to compensate the harmonics generated by the main inverter, reducing the current distortion by delivering reactive power. The switching frequency of the main inverter is limited to reduce the switching losses by means of synchronous pulsewidth modulation. In this work, synchronous optimal pulsewidth modulation that minimize the weighted voltage THD in the NPC has been selected, while higher frequency subharmonic PWM is used for the floating H-Bridges. Design criteria for the selection of a proper value for the H-Bridge dc-link voltage and a simple control algorithm for its regulation are proposed. This scheme achieves currents with low distortion, resulting in a lower torque ripple and lower machine losses in a induction motor drive. Experimental results using a 2.5 kW converter prototype feeding a R-L load are shown to illustrate the operation of this topology and dynamic operation of an induction machine fed by this converter under V/f control is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075199/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10729035","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075199/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid multilevel inverter drive with synchronous modulation and current waveform improvement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid multilevel inverter drive with synchronous modulation and current waveform improvement","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"025_IEMDC2009-11063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066908S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5075224,"authors":[{"name":"Seong Taek Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA","Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Seong Taek","lastName":"Lee","id":"37600739700"},{"name":"Timothy A.

The analyzed motor is a high-speed brushless field excitation machine that offers high torque per ampere per core length at low speed and weakened flux at high speed, which was developed for the traction motor of a hybrid electric vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075224","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069086/5075166/05075224.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075166","startPage":"317","endPage":"322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-factor and torque calculation with consideration of cross saturation of the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor with brushless field excitation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power-factor and torque calculation with consideration of cross saturation of the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor with brushless field excitation","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075224/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10729060","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075224/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-factor and torque calculation with consideration of cross saturation of the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor with brushless field excitation","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"050_IEMDC2009-10824.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.162547S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5075225,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

To increase the throughput of a placement robot for printed circuit boards, very fast linear motion is required. A moving magnet tubular actuator with axially magnetized magnets is selected. Using a semi-analytical magnetic field description coupled to thermal models, a design is created that potentially could achieve a translator acceleration of 20 g. A prototype of the designed actuator is built and coupled with a Simulink dSpace system to perform extensive measurements to validate the models and investigate the achievable acceleration within a pre-determined motion profile. The electro-motive force is measured, and the disturbance forces are identified. The position error is measured during the motion profile with an acceleration of 20 g and a stroke of 30 mm. Furthermore, thermal measurements are performed to check the achievable duty cycle. The built design shows good agreement with the models, and the specified acceleration of 20 g is achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and experimental verification of a tubular actuator for 20 g acceleration in a pick and place application","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075240","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069086/5075166/05075240.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and experimental verification of a tubular actuator for 20 g acceleration in a pick and place application","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075240/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10729076","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and experimental verification of a tubular actuator for 20 g acceleration in a pick and place application","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"066_IEMDC2009-11170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051293S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5075258,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Oswald","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Energeiwandlungstechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Oswald","id":"37561993100"},{"name":"Hans Georg Herzog","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Energeiwandlungstechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans Georg","lastName":"Herzog","id":"37529348400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4251-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4252-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5075258","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Usability","Torque","Geometry","Stators","Resonance","Testing","Rotors","Solid modeling","Application software","Vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","machine theory","optimisation","stepping motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid stepper motor","2D-FEM model","3D-FEM model","finite element optimisation method","detent torque","holding torque","special machine geometry"]}],"abstract":"The optimization of hybrid stepper motors and similar special machine geometries can not be performed effectively due to a large number of elements which follow from the fact, that the dimension of the air gap is tiny against the whole geometry and that it is necessary to model a relative big part of the machine. The presented paper shows how to model hybrid stepper motors with finite element method more effectively. Based on a certain machine, the limits and problems using full 3D models are identified. Further attempts with 2D models follow. It becomes clear that, depending on the features of special software, these 2D models can only be used to analyze certain aspects like detent torque or holding torque around small stationary working points. The biggest problem is to rotate the rotor part against a stator with impressed current. Therefore a possibility has been searched to model a full working machine without the disadvantages of a full 3D model. A solution was found with a reduced 3D model. This is the quintessence of the paper. We also investigated which modeling depth has to be performed. It will become clear which boundary conditions have to be taken into account to reduce the model. Moreover the theoretical background which is necessary to do the reduction is given. It can be seen, that the reduced model can be used to get reliable results for an optimization. To conclude a comparison between the different models and results shows how useful the reduced model will be, if optimization or investigation of such a machine shall be done.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the usability of 2D- and 3D-FEM for a hybrid stepper motor","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075258","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069086/5075166/05075258.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the usability of 2D- and 3D-FEM for a hybrid stepper motor","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075258/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10729093","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the usability of 2D- and 3D-FEM for a hybrid stepper motor","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"084_IEMDC2009-11177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044425S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5075281,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this algorithm, the non-orthogonal reference voltage is obtained according to the sector where the reference voltage (V*) lies. From the triangle identification inside the hexagon, the Nearest Three Vectors are determined using the information of the sector and triangle where V* is located. The duty cycles are calculated by a set of simple equations. The softwares Quartus IIreg, ModelSimreg and MatLabreg were used to develop the algorithm. Fixed-point 16-bit signed patterns were used for calculus. A 10 MHz clock was used to obtain the switching time, whereas the PWM worked with a 50 MHz clock, in order to improve the PWM generation accuracy. The synchronism between switching time calculation and the PWM signal generation was carried out by a state machine. Alterareg Cyclonereg II with EP2C20F484C7N FPGA was used to generate the V* and develop the proposed algorithm. The results obtained with the DCI three-level inverter were satisfactory, validating the FPGA algorithm implementation. This algorithm can be extended to topologies of generic-ordered DCI multilevel inverters, very slightly altering its computational efforts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Field programmable gate arrays","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation","Voltage","Clocks","Diodes","Equations","Mathematical model","Computer languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","space vector PWM algorithm","multilevel inverters","non-orthogonal moving reference frame","field programmable gate array"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075283","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075283","startPage":"709","endPage":"716","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069086/5075166/05075283.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075283/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of Space Vector PWM algorithm for multilevel inverters using non-orthogonal moving reference frame","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10729118","htmlLink":"/document/5075283/","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of Space Vector PWM algorithm for multilevel inverters using non-orthogonal moving reference frame","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"109_IEMDC2009-11255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5075301,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Department of Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Yu Gong","id":"37574039700"},{"name":"Wei Cui","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Wei Cui","id":"37303011700"},{"name":"K.

The idea is to use a neural network to predict system's eigenvalues, taking as input data voltage at buses, generated power, reactive load, and the output data are the eigenvalues. Unstable and poorly damped modes are identified and then these modes will be damped. The system modifies the parameters until reach a stable operating point. In the case of a stable operating point with a poorly damped oscillatory mode, the objective is to increase the damping of that mode. That is, the power system linearization at the operating point is modified. Operator actions such as redispatch, varying load, varying reactive power (voltage) often modify the operating point to do this; the effect of this is that transients near enough to the operating point will decay more quickly. However, the analysis does not attempt the more difficult study of large signal transients. The existence of a stable operating point is of course necessary for system security, but there is no guarantee that large signal transients will result in operation at that operating point.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075302","startPage":"845","endPage":"850","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075166","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069086/5075166/05075302.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Function approximation with neural networks for obtaining an operating point sufficiently small signal stable in power systems including wind parks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075302/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Function approximation with neural networks for obtaining an operating point sufficiently small signal stable in power systems including wind parks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075302/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10729137","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Function approximation with neural networks for obtaining an operating point sufficiently small signal stable in power systems including wind parks","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"129_IEMDC2009-11245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060402S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5075351,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed explicit controllers consist in precomputed (optimal) state feedbacks that are selected according to the measured state using binary search-trees. This type of controller is well suited to obtain very fast control algorithms that impose high dynamic performance. The control scheme is based on two cascaded explicit model predictive controllers, one for the torque control another for the speed control. The nonlinearities of the motor dynamics that are due to the speed are taken into account into the torque controller derivation. The resulting adaptive closed-loop system presents a high dynamic performance for all operating points. A rotor speed and position observer is used to orient the control variables on the rotor flux without position sensor. The overall control scheme allows optimal use of the inverter and drive dynamic capabilities.

This paper proposes a stator winding temperature estimation method for the thermal protection of inverter-fed electric motors. By modifying the space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) in an open-loop motor drive, a dc voltage can be intermittently injected into the motor. The stator temperature can be estimated by measuring only the dc component of the phase current under both constant and variable load conditions. The evaluation of the resultant torque pulsation and the compensation for serial resistances are also discussed. The proposed stator temperature estimation method is validated from experimental results under variable load conditions and both healthy and impaired cooling conditions. The error in the stator temperature estimation is within 8degC under different operating conditions. The significance of this method lies in its non-intrusive nature: only current sensors are required for implementation; the normal operation of the motor is not interrupted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075375/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075375/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10728928","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An active stator temperature estimation technique for thermal protection of inverter-fed induction motors with considerations of impaired cooling detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An active stator temperature estimation technique for thermal protection of inverter-fed induction motors with considerations of impaired cooling detection","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"202_IEMDC2009-10893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073345S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5075380,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Sari","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST Institute, University of Franche-Comte, Belfort, France"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Sari","id":"37869414400"},{"name":"Frederic Dubas","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST Institute, University of Franche-Comte, Belfort, France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Dubas","id":"37565824100"},{"name":"Christophe Espanet","affiliation":["FC-LAB Institute, University of Franche-Comte, Belfort, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Espanet","id":"37267925500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4251-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4252-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5075380","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Fuel cells","Synchronous motors","Energy consumption","Protons","Biomembranes","Analytical models","Maxwell equations","Particle swarm optimization","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressors","Maxwell equations","particle swarm optimisation","permanent magnet motors","proton exchange membrane fuel cells","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization design","PMSM","permanent magnet synchronous motor drive","PEM fuel cell air-circuit","PSO algorithm","particle swarm optimization","air-compressor","Maxwells equations","proton exchange membrane fuel cell","power 5 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuel cell","ancillaries","compressor","analytical model","optimization","PSO algorithm","permanent magnet machine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075380","abstract":"This paper deals with the design of a 500 W permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor (PMSM) used to drive the air-compressor of a 5 kW fuel cell (FC).

From a practical point of view and the demand of minimum complexity, a simple idealized motor model is used many times. Due to this simplification and to a change of coordinates, an observation error of the back EMF voltage occurs, which has, as a consequence, an effect on the estimated rotor position. This study describes an intelligent method of sensorless speed control of PMSM for the whole speed range, which is especially appropriate for pump- and fan-applications. A quite simple method of back EMF voltage observation was found and integrated into the control strategy. Furthermore, the mentioned systematic errors and their effects on the accuracy of the estimated rotor position are analyzed systematically and documented carefully. Theoretical results are verified by simulations and measurement results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10728938","htmlLink":"/document/5075385/","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A study on systematic errors concerning rotor position estimation of PMSM based on back EMF voltage observation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on systematic errors concerning rotor position estimation of PMSM based on back EMF voltage observation","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"212_IEMDC2009-11316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069339S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5075386,"authors":[{"name":"P.

These stator spectral components can include voltage, current and power and are used to detect turn faults, broken rotor bars, bearing failures and air gap eccentricities. Presently, many techniques that are based on steady-state analysis are being applied to induction machines. However, induction motors are not always operating under complete steady state conditions, therefore prompting the development of non-stationary techniques for fault detection. In this paper, it will be shown how the steady-state fault detection technique, Extended park's vector approach (EPVA), can be improved to detect inter-turn faults during transients by incorporating the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to the detection scheme. The new technique shows that stator turn faults can be unambiguously detected under transient conditions.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075386","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069086/5075166/05075386.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075166","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of wavelets for the detection of inter-turn faults in induction machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The application of wavelets for the detection of inter-turn faults in induction machines","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075386/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10728939","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075386/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of wavelets for the detection of inter-turn faults in induction machines","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"213_IEMDC2009-10991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049938S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5075405,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407251300"},{"name":"Song Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404500200"},{"name":"Dionysios C.

The controller is an adaptive and based on a nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA-L2). Mamdani type of FLC will be used for speed control.

Despite the simplicity of those algorithms some drawbacks arise when signals have variable amplitude or are polluted with relevant harmonic content and measurement noise. These are typical conditions in aircraft AC power systems, where the fundamental frequency can be variable in the range 360-900 Hz. To improve the quality of phase and frequency estimates in such power systems a novel PLL scheme based on a real-time implementation of discrete fourier transform (DFT) is presented in this paper. The DFT algorithm calculates the amplitudes of three consecutive components in the frequency domain that are used to determine an error signal to be minimized by a PI controller that estimates the fundamental frequency. The integral of the estimated frequency is the estimated phase of the fundamental component that is fed back to the DFT algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be then reviewed as a PLL in which the phase detector is performed via a DFT-based algorithm. A comparison between the performances of standard PLL and the proposed DFT-PLL has been realized using computer simulations and experiments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075450","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069086/5075166/05075450.pdf","startPage":"1820","endPage":"1825","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DFT-based phase locked loop for phase and amplitude tracking in aircraft electrical systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A DFT-based phase locked loop for phase and amplitude tracking in aircraft electrical systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075450/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10729022","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075450/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DFT-based phase locked loop for phase and amplitude tracking in aircraft electrical systems","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"277_IEMDC2009-11021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051839S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5069086","isNumber":"5075166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5069086","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5075166","articleId":"5075450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5075516,"authors":[{"name":"James A.

Due to the computation-intensive nature of most signal processing algorithms, the energy saving potential largely depends on the behavior of computer arithmetic units in response to overscaled supply voltage. This paper shows that different hardware implementations of the same computer arithmetic function may respond to VOS very differently and result in different energy saving potentials. Therefore, the selection of appropriate computer arithmetic architecture is an important issue in voltage-overscaled signal processing system design. This paper presents an analytical method to estimate the statistics of computer arithmetic computation errors due to supply voltage overscaling. Compared with computation-intensive circuit simulations, this analytical approach can be several orders of magnitude faster and can achieve a reasonable accuracy. This approach can be used to choose the appropriate computer arithmetic architecture in voltage-overscaled signal processing systems. Finally, we carry out case studies on a coordinate rotation digital computer processor and a finite-impulse-response filter to further demonstrate the importance of choosing proper computer arithmetic implementations.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2012863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5437466/05075518.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2012863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation Error Analysis in Digital Signal Processing Systems With Overscaled Supply Voltage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Computation Error Analysis in Digital Signal Processing Systems With Overscaled Supply Voltage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075518/","publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11204167","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075518/","volume":"18","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation Error Analysis in Digital Signal Processing Systems With Overscaled Supply Voltage","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-liu-2012863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120576S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5437466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5437466","articleId":"5075518","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5075522,"authors":[{"name":"Song Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Liu","id":"37716047800"},{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37634335800"},{"name":"Seda Ogrenci Memik","firstName":"Seda","lastName":"Ogrenci Memik"},{"name":"Gokhan Memik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Gokhan","lastName":"Memik","id":"38367265800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5075522","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":441},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075522","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Temperature","Energy management","Energy consumption","Power system management","Buffer storage","Steady-state","US Department of Energy","Delay","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","DRAM chips","integrated circuit modelling","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance DRAMs","low-power-state-based techniques","throughput-aware page-hit-aware write buffer","power consumption","steady-state temperature","adaptive temperature management","adaptive power management","write operations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM","power","temperature"]}],"abstract":"High-performance DRAMs are providing increasing memory access bandwidth to processors, which is leading to high power consumption and operating temperature in DRAM chips.

This approach reduces DRAM system power consumption and temperature without any performance penalty. We combine the throughput-aware page-hit-aware write buffer (TAP) with low-power-state-based techniques for further power and temperature reduction, namely, TAP-low. Our experiments show that a system with TAP-low could reduce the total DRAM power consumption by up to 68.6% (19.9% on average). The steady-state temperature can be reduced by as much as 7.84\u00b0C and 2.55\u00b0C on average across eight representative workloads.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2014842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2014842","startPage":"684","endPage":"688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5437466/05075522.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approach for Adaptive DRAM Temperature and Power Management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Approach for Adaptive DRAM Temperature and Power Management","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11204169","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5075522/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach for Adaptive DRAM Temperature and Power Management","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-sliu-2014842.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055045S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5437466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5437466","articleId":"5075522","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5075524,"authors":[{"name":"Yat-Hei Lam","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","Solutions Group, Synopsys, Inc., Macao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5471724/5075524/5075524-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yat-Hei Lam (S'02\u2013M'08) received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2001 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently with the Solutions Group, Synopsys, Inc., Macau SAR, China as a Design Engineer of power management IP solutions.

Carry-save arithmetic occurs naturally in a variety of DSP applications, and further opportunities to exploit it can be exposed through systematic data flow transformations that can be applied by a hardware compiler. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), however, are not particularly well suited to carry-save arithmetic. To address this concern, we introduce the \u00bffield programmable counter array\u00bf (FPCA), an accelerator for carry-save arithmetic intended for integration into an FPGA as an alternative to DSP blocks. In addition to multiplication and multiply accumulation, the FPCA can accelerate more general carry-save operations, such as multi-input addition (e.g., add k > 2 integers) and multipliers that have been fused with other adders. Our experiments show that the FPCA accelerates a wider variety of applications than DSP blocks and improves performance, area utilization, and energy consumption compared with soft FPGA logic.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2014380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2014380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5437466/05075526.pdf","startPage":"578","endPage":"590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving FPGA Performance for Carry-Save Arithmetic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving FPGA Performance for Carry-Save Arithmetic","volume":"18","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204173","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075526/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving FPGA Performance for Carry-Save Arithmetic","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-brisk-2014380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14414S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5437466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5437466","articleId":"5075526","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5075528,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Amjady","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Semnan University, Semnan, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Nima Amjady was born in Tehran, Iran, on February 24, 1971.

The proposed ED formulation includes ramp rate limits, prohibited operating zones (POZs), system spinning reserve, valve loading effects, and multiple fuel options, which usually are found simultaneously in realistic power systems. In the next stage, security constraints of the power system are also included in the proposed model, which leads to nonconvex ED problem with AC constraints. To solve this problem a new real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) with arithmetic-average-bound crossover (AABX) and hybrid mutation (HM) is presented. HM of the proposed RCGA is composed of wavelet and Michalewicz mutations. The effectiveness of the proposed RCGA to solve both the ED and ED with AC constraints is shown on different test systems and compared with some of the most recently published research works in the area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10793382","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5075528/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonconvex Economic Dispatch With AC Constraints by a New Real Coded Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonconvex Economic Dispatch With AC Constraints by a New Real Coded Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-amjady-2022998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161381S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5170200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5170200","articleId":"5075528","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075530,"authors":[{"name":"Soo-Hyoung Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5170200/5075530/5075530-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soo-Hyoung Lee (S'08) received the B.S. degree from the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2008.

Additionally, such increase can result in large power losses of the system. In costly and environmentally effective manner to avoid constructing the new infrastructures such as power plants, transmission lines, etc., the distributed generation (DG) has been paid great attention so far as a potential solution for these problems. The beneficial effects of DG mainly depend on its location and size. Therefore, selection of optimal location and size of the DG is a necessary process to maintain the stability and reliability of existing system effectively before it is connected to a power grid. However, the systematic and cardinal rule for this issue is still an open question. In this paper, a method to determine the optimal locations of multiple DGs is proposed by considering power loss. Also, their optimal sizes are determined by using the Kalman filter algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed control","Power system reliability","Power system stability","Power generation","Power transmission lines","Maintenance","Power systems","Power system planning","Photovoltaic systems","Power system protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","Kalman filters","power grids","power system reliability","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed generations","Kalman filter algorithm","power system stability","grid connection","load concentration bus","power system reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed generation","grid connection","Kalman filter algorithm","load-concentration-bus","optimal location","optimal size","power loss"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2016540","startPage":"1393","endPage":"1400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5170200/05075530.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2016540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selection of Optimal Location and Size of Multiple Distributed Generations by Using Kalman Filter Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Selection of Optimal Location and Size of Multiple Distributed Generations by Using Kalman Filter Algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10793393","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","volume":"24","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075530/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selection of Optimal Location and Size of Multiple Distributed Generations by Using Kalman Filter Algorithm","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs03-jpark-2016540.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050236S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5170200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"5170200","articleId":"5075530","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5075532,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5173737/5075532/5075532-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei Zhang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Physics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","From 2006 to 2009, he was a Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, and the Department of Neurosurgery, Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.

The dc resistances of these inductors are less than 12 mOmega. Soft magnetic material CoFeHfO was successfully integrated into the inductor fabrication to increase the inductance. The quality factors are more than 80 in a frequency range of 1.5-2 GHz for air-core inductors and more than 23 in a range of 200-300 MHz for magnetic inductors. The net inductance improvement of the magnetic inductor over air-core inductor is about 12%, which could be further enhanced with a thicker magnetic core, according to our theoretic calculation and HFSS simulation. We also characterized the permeability spectra of CoFeHfO material on the PCB substrate, simulated the high-frequency performance of the magnetic integrated inductor by HFSS, and, for the first time, reached a good agreement with the experimental data. The experimental and simulation results of the magnetic inductors as compared to those of the air-core inductors point out the future direction to further optimize magnetic integrated inductors.","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2009.2019845","startPage":"780","endPage":"787","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced

A bidirectional dc/dc converter is used between SCAPs and the dc bus. Batteries are directly connected to the dc bus. The originality of this study is focused on SCAP behavior modeling and energy management strategy. The proposed strategy is based on a polynomial (RST) controller. For reasons of cost and existing components (not optimized) such as batteries and semiconductors, the experimental test benches are designed in reduced scale. The characterized packs of SCAPs include two modules of ten cells in series for each one and present a maximum voltage of 27 V. The proposed strategy is implemented on a PIC18F4431 microcontroller for two dc/dc converter topology controls. Experimental and simulation results obtained from the polynomial control strategy are presented, analyzed, and compared with that of classical proportional-integral control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075550/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11054656","volume":"57","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DC/DC Converter Design for Supercapacitor and Battery Power Management in Hybrid Vehicle Applications\u2014Polynomial Control Strategy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC/DC Converter Design for Supercapacitor and Battery Power Management in Hybrid Vehicle Applications\u2014Polynomial Control Strategy","sourcePdf":"tie-camara-2025283.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128868S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5379132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"264","xplore-issue":"5379132","articleId":"5075550","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5075552,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Krismer","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5410131/5075552/5075552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Florian Krismer (S'05) received the M.Sc. degree (with honors) from the University of Technology Vienna, Vienna, Austria, in 2004.

The nominal power is 2 kW, the HV dc bus varies between 240 and 450 V, and the battery voltage range is between 11 and 16 V. Consequently, battery currents of up to 200 A occur at nominal power. In automotive applications, high converter efficiency and high power densities are required. Thus, it is necessary to accurately predict the dissipated power for each power component in order to identify and to properly design the heavily loaded parts of the converter. In combination with measured efficiency values, it is shown that conventional converter analysis predicts substantially inaccurate efficiencies for the given converter. This paper describes the main reasons why the conventional method fails and documents the different steps required to predict the power losses more accurately. With the presented converter prototype, an efficiency of more than 92% is achieved at an output power of 2 kW in a wide input/output voltage range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","volume":"57","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11119940","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5075552/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Power Loss Model Derivation of a High-Current Dual Active Bridge Converter for an Automotive Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Power Loss Model Derivation of a High-Current Dual Active Bridge Converter for an Automotive Application","sourcePdf":"tie-krismer-2025284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084852S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5410131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"285","xplore-issue":"5410131","articleId":"5075552","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5075553,"authors":[{"name":"Katsumi Yamazaki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, Chiba Institute of Technology, Narashino, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5352216/5075553/5075553-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Katsumi Yamazaki (M'96) was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1964.

This diagram can easily be used to describe different control strategies, possible operating conditions, both below- and above-rated speeds, etc. The saturation effect is also discussed with this diagram by finite-element-method calculations. A prototype high-performance SynRM is designed for experimental studies, and then, both machines' [corresponding induction machine (IM)] performances at similar loading and operation conditions are tested, measured, and compared to demonstrate the potential of SynRM. The laboratory measurements (on a standard 15-kW Eff1 IM and its counterpart SynRM) show that SynRM has higher efficiency, torque density, and inverter rating and lower rotor temperature and PF in comparison to IM at the same winding-temperature-rise condition. The measurements show that the torque capability of SynRM closely follows that of IM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075554/","volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5075554/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11019820","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical and Experimental Reevaluation of Synchronous Reluctance Machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical and Experimental Reevaluation of Synchronous Reluctance Machine","sourcePdf":"tie-rajabimoghaddam-2025286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075372S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5352216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5352216","articleId":"5075554","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5075556,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Under these effects, it is feasible to adjust the frame size to maximize the throughput. The majority of existing frame-size optimization solutions are based on the assumption that the optimal frame size only depends on the channel conditions. These approaches do not consider the contention effects, thus leading to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we tackle the frame-size optimization problem using a machine-learning-based adaptive approach. This approach takes both the channel conditions and the contention effect into consideration. In this approach, each source station performs the throughput measurement and collects the ldquoframe size-throughputrdquo patterns. The collected patterns contain the knowledge about the effects of channel conditions and contention processes. Based on these patterns, our approach uses neural networks to accurately model the throughput as a function with respect to the frame size. After the knowledge building, we obtain the gradient information to adjust the frame size. The main contribution of this paper is that we take both the channel conditions and the contention effect into consideration, without any assumptions of the channel models or the stations' behavior that are required by the previous analytical solutions. We perform comprehensive simulations to validate that the proposed approach can effectively optimize the frame size under various channel conditions and contention effects. We also implement the proposed approach and perform comprehensive experiments on a real testbed to evaluate the effectiveness and reaction speed of the proposed approach in practice.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075557/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","volume":"58","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10966674","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075557/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Machine-Learning-Based Adaptive Approach for Frame-Size Optimization in Wireless LAN Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine-Learning-Based Adaptive Approach for Frame-Size Optimization in Wireless LAN Environments","sourcePdf":"tvt-lin-2025133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07626S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5075557","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5075558,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Hau Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5307285/5075558/5075558-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shih-Hau Fang (M'07) received the B.S. degree from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1999 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2001 and 2009, respectively, all in communication engineering.","From 2001 to 2007, he was a software architect with the Internet Services Division, Chung-Hwa Telecom, Taipei.

Our algorithm projects the received signal strength (RSS) onto a discriminative space such that the information of all access points (APs) is more efficiently utilized. The projection is determined by multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), thereby guaranteeing maximal discriminative information involved in the positioning system. The study conducts a series of experiments on the effects of our approach in a realistic indoor environment. The results show that not only is the positioning accuracy significantly improved, but the system cost, including the computation and data collection, is also greatly reduced at the same time. This is because our approach extracts only useful information for positioning, whereas the redundant noise is discarded to avoid the problem of overfitting and unnecessary calculations. Compared with prior works, this technique can produce a more graceful balance between the positioning accuracy and the computational complexity for the resource-weak clients.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075558/","accessionNumber":"10966647","displayDocTitle":"Projection-Based Location System via Multiple Discriminant Analysis in Wireless Local Area Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projection-Based Location System via Multiple Discriminant Analysis in Wireless Local Area Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-lin-2025134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094912S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5075558","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5075560,"authors":[{"name":"Haixia Zhang","affiliation":["Google Inc., CA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Haixia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280795800"},{"name":"Michel T.

With the proposed approach, the covariance-based precoding concept for multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MISO) single-stream transmission can effectively be extended to a multiuser MIMO multistream transmission link.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Multiuser MIMO Multistream Transmission","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2025282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05075560.pdf","startPage":"5336","endPage":"5341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2025282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075560/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"On Multiuser MIMO Multistream Transmission","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5075560/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966624","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Multiuser MIMO Multistream Transmission","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2025282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049002S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5075560","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075570,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy W.

These active cannulas are actuated by relative translations and rotations applied at the tube bases, which create bending via elastic tube interaction. An accurate kinematic model of cannula shape is required for applications in surgical and other settings. Previous models are limited to circular tube precurvatures, and neglect torsional deformation in curved sections. Recent generalizations account for arbitrary tube preshaping and bending and torsion throughout the cannula, providing differential equations that define cannula shape. In this paper, we show how to simplify these equations using Frenet-Serret frames. An advantage of this approach is the interpretation of torsional components of the preset tube shapes as ldquoforcing functionsrdquo on the cannula's differential equations. We also elucidate a process for numerically solving the differential equations, and use it to produce simulations illustrating the implications of torsional deformation and helical tube shapes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5208605/05075590.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2025135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2025135","startPage":"2308","endPage":"2311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parsimonious Evaluation of Concentric-Tube Continuum Robot Equilibrium Conformation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075590/","displayDocTitle":"Parsimonious Evaluation of Concentric-Tube Continuum Robot Equilibrium Conformation","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075590/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10828630","pubMedId":"19535313","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parsimonious Evaluation of Concentric-Tube Continuum Robot Equilibrium Conformation","sourcePdf":"tbme-rucker-2025135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038987S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5208605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5208605","articleId":"5075590","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5075597,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Chyun Chiou","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Chyun","lastName":"Chiou","id":"37584548100"},{"name":"Cheng-Hsiu Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Hsiu","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37932854500"},{"name":"Jen-Tsai Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Tsai","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37275495600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"5075597","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":587},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip","Coupling circuits","Circuit analysis","Transmission line theory","Arm","Admittance","Distributed parameter circuits","Prototypes","Equations","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip couplers","multiport networks","transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetrical four-port microstrip coupler","crossover application","transmission line theory","circuit area reduction"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comments on \"A Symmetrical Four-Port Microstrip Coupler for Crossover Application","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2021881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161480","endPage":"1860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5161480/05075597.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2021881","startPage":"1859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075597","abstract":"In the paper of Chen and Yeo (2007), the authors demonstrate a four-port coupler for crossover application. In their eigenmode model analysis, the entire circuit is decomposed into tapers and two rings with four external arms. In formulation, the eigenadmittance of the inner substructure is taken account as the load of that of the outer one. A cascade of P short sections is then used to approximate the taper and incorporated into the model of the composite structure by successively applying the input admittance formula of a loaded transmission line. Finally, one prototype circuit solution obtained by an optimization process is demonstrated. In this paper, the transmission line theory is applied to the circuit analysis. It is found that the circuit structure is so versatile for the crossover application that infinite numbers of solutions can be simply obtained by solving two simultaneous equations. In addition, the tapers for input/output matching can be saved, leading not only to circuit area reduction, but also to formulation simplification. A microstrip coupler is fabricated and measured for confirmation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10776252","htmlLink":"/document/5075597/","displayDocTitle":"Comments on \"A Symmetrical Four-Port Microstrip Coupler for Crossover Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comments on \"A Symmetrical Four-Port Microstrip Coupler for Crossover Application","sourcePdf":"57tmtt07-jkuo-2021881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036393S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5161480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5161480","articleId":"5075597","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075599,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5161480/5075599/5075599-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Zhang (S'04-M'08) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2007, all in electrical engineering.","From October 2000 to March 2001, she was with the Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, as a Research Assistant.

Compared to body surface potential (BSP) recordings and electrophysiological information reconstructed on heart surfaces, volumetric myocardial transmembrane potential (TMP) dynamics is of greater clinical importance in exhibiting arrhythmic details and arrythmogenic substrates inside the myocardium. This paper presents a physiological-model-constrained statistical framework to reconstruct volumetric TMP dynamics inside the 3-D myocardium from noninvasive BSP recordings. General knowledge of volumetric TMP activity is incorporated through the modeling of cardiac electrophysiological system, and is used to constrain TMP reconstruction. This physiological system is reformulated into a stochastic state-space representation to take into account model and data uncertainties, and nonlinear data assimilation is developed to estimate volumetric myocardial TMP dynamics from personal BSP data. Robustness of the presented framework to practical model and data errors is evaluated. Comparison of epicardial potential reconstructions with classical regularization-based approaches is performed on computational phantom regarding right bundle branch blocks. Further, phantom experiments on intramural focal activities and an initial real-data study on postmyocardial infarction demonstrate the potential of the framework in reconstructing local arrhythmic details and identifying arrhythmogenic substrates inside the myocardium.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2024531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5393902/05075606.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2024531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393902","startPage":"296","endPage":"315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physiological-Model-Constrained Noninvasive Reconstruction of Volumetric Myocardial Transmembrane Potentials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Physiological-Model-Constrained Noninvasive Reconstruction of Volumetric Myocardial Transmembrane Potentials","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075606/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071380","pubMedId":"19535316","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5075606/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physiological-Model-Constrained Noninvasive Reconstruction of Volumetric Myocardial Transmembrane Potentials","sourcePdf":"tbme-wang-2024531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144621S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5393902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5393902","articleId":"5075606","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075614,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Ortlepp","affiliation":["Institute for Information Technology, RSFQ Design Group, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ortlepp","id":"37313567700"},{"name":"F.

The present design and optimization process does not take into account their parasitic capacitances to ground. This becomes an important issue for ultra fast applications above 100 GHz, but also for circuits dedicated to control quantum electronics. We report on a theoretical and experimental investigation of the influence of ground capacitances. The impedance matching between the connecting microstrip lines and the Josephson junction is a key issue for the correct operation of these circuits. We performed circuit simulations and collected experimental data of correct and incorrect operating circuits to derive design criteria. The critical reflection coefficient is found to be 0.35 and the particular design must use a smaller value for transfer and a larger value for storage of SFQ pulses, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2009.2019284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2009.2019284","startPage":"644","endPage":"648","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/5166641/05075614.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impedance Matching of Microstrip Inductors in Digital Superconductive Electronics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Impedance Matching of Microstrip Inductors in Digital Superconductive Electronics","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","volume":"19","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075614/","accessionNumber":"10781653","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075614/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impedance Matching of Microstrip Inductors in Digital Superconductive Electronics","sourcePdf":"tasc-ortlepp-2019284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143544S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"5166641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5166641","articleId":"5075614","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5075626,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/5379144/5075626/5075626-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sheng Lin (S'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004.

In a CNT, the threshold voltage can be adjusted by controlling the chirality vector (i.e., the diameter). In the proposed six-transistor SRAM cell design, while all CNTFETs of the same type have the same chirality, n-type and p-type transistors have different chiralities, i.e., a dual-diameter design of SRAM cell. As figures of merit, stability, power dissipation, and write time are considered when selecting the chirality for the best overall performance. A new metric, denoted as \u00bfSPR,\u00bf is proposed to capture these figures of merit. This metric shows that a CNTFET-based SRAM cell provides an \u00bfSPR\u00bf that is four times higher than for its CMOS counterpart that has the same configuration, thus attaining superior performance. Finally, the sensitivity of the CNTFET SRAM design to process variations is assessed and compared with its CMOS design counterpart. Extensive simulations have been performed to investigate the distribution of the power and delay of the CNTFET-based SRAM cell due to variations in the diameter, supply voltage, and temperature of the CNTFETs. The CNTFET-based SRAM cell demonstrates that it tolerates the process, power supply voltage, and temperature variations significantly better than its CMOS counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2009.2025128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/5379144/05075626.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2009.2025128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a CNTFET-Based SRAM Cell by Dual-Chirality Selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075626/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a CNTFET-Based SRAM Cell by Dual-Chirality Selection","volume":"9","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075626/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11054252","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a CNTFET-Based SRAM Cell by Dual-Chirality Selection","sourcePdf":"tnano-lin-2025128.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064353S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5379144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5379144","articleId":"5075626","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075630,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongmin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhongmin Wang (S'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 1998 and 2002, respectively, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Utah State University, in 2005.

Important applications of this paper include smart surveillance systems, semantic video database indexing, and interactive systems. This technology can be applied to several video domains including airport terminal, parking lot, traffic, subway stations, aerial surveillance, and sign language data. In this paper, we identify the two main components of the event understanding process: abstraction and event modeling. Abstraction is the process of molding the data into informative units to be used as input to the event model. Due to space restrictions, we will limit the discussion on the topic of abstraction.

Technol., Haifa, Israel, Tech. Rep. CIS-2009-06, 2009) for a more complete discussion. Event modeling is devoted to describing events of interest formally and enabling recognition of these events as they occur in the video sequence. Event modeling can be further decomposed in the categories of pattern-recognition methods, state event models, and semantic event models. In this survey, we discuss this proposed taxonomy of the literature, offer a unifying terminology, and discuss popular event modeling formalisms (e.g., hidden Markov model) and their use in video event understanding using extensive examples from the literature. Finally, we consider the application domain of video event understanding in light of the proposed taxonomy, and propose future directions for research in this field.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2023380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5204734/05075633.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2023380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204734","startPage":"489","endPage":"504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding Video Events: A Survey of Methods for Automatic Interpretation of Semantic Occurrences in Video","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Video Events: A Survey of Methods for Automatic Interpretation of Semantic Occurrences in Video","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"39","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828638","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075633/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Video Events: A Survey of Methods for Automatic Interpretation of Semantic Occurrences in Video","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-lavee-2023380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189412S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5204734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5204734","articleId":"5075633","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075642,"authors":[{"name":"Michael John Moore","affiliation":["Bren School of Information and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael John","lastName":"Moore","id":"37305543900"},{"name":"Tatsuya Suda","affiliation":["Bren School of Information and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Suda","id":"37271791600"},{"name":"Kazuhiro Oiwa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Life Science, University of Hyogo, Hyogo, Japan","National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Oiwa","id":"37317083100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1241"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2639"}],"articleNumber":"5075642","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":156,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1676},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nanotechnology Council","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/nanotech/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075642","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Molecular communication","Information rates","Nanobioscience","Biological information theory","Decoding","Biological system modeling","Optical fiber communication","Optical receivers","Proteins","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","molecular biophysics","nanobiotechnology","noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["molecular communication","noise effects","information rate","biological nanomachines","information molecules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information molecules","information rate","kinesin molecular motor","microtubule","molecular communication","nanomachine communication","signal and noise","simulation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Biomimetics","Biopolymers","Cell Communication","Computer Simulation","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Biological","Models, Statistical"]}],"abstract":"Molecular communication is a new paradigm for communication between biological nanomachines over a nano- and microscale range. As biological nanomachines (or nanomachines in short) are too small and simple to communicate through traditional communication mechanisms (e.g., through sending and receiving of radio or infrared signals), molecular communication provides a mechanism for a nanomachine (i.e., a sender) to communicate information by propagating molecules (i.e., information molecules) that represent the information to a nanomachine (i.e., a receiver).

The approaches considered in this paper include propagating information molecules (diffusion or directional transport along protein filaments), removing excessive information molecules (natural decay or receiver removal of excessive information molecules), and encoding and decoding approaches (redundant information molecules to represent information and to decode information). Two types of molecular communication systems are considered: a unicast system in which a sender communicates with a single receiver and a broadcast system in which a sender communicates with multiple receivers. Through exploring tradeoffs among the various approaches on the two types of molecular communication systems, this paper identifies promising approaches and shows the feasibility of an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">vitro</i>\n molecular communication system.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2009.2025039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2009.2025039","startPage":"169","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel5/7728/5185450/05075642.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5185450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Molecular Communication: Modeling Noise Effects on Information Rate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Molecular Communication: Modeling Noise Effects on Information Rate","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10802287","pubMedId":"19535324","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075642/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Molecular Communication: Modeling Noise Effects on Information Rate","sourcePdf":"tnb-moore-2025039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16922S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"5185450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"5185450","articleId":"5075642","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5075647,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Assalini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5307285/5075647/5075647-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Assalini (S'02\u2013M'06) received the Laurea degree in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from the University of Padua, Padua, Italy, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","He was a Visiting Researcher with AST Labs, ST Microelectronics, Milan, Italy, with the Communication Technology Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, with the Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K., and with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.

It is shown that the variance of the mutual information provides details on the amount of available diversity, and it suggests guidelines on transmitter design. The optimal delays, in the outage capacity maximization sense, are found for linear and cyclic delay diversity (LDD and CDD) schemes. It is proved that the outage rates for subcarrier diversity (SD) systems are the same as for the optimized CDD case.

It is well known that MLSE provides a considerable benefit for amplitude modulated modulation formats such as on-off keying (OOK) and optical duobinary. However, when applied to optical phase modulation formats, such as differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) and differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK), it has been shown that the benefit is only marginal. This paper investigates joint-decision MLSE (JD-MLSE) detection applied to 10.7-Gb/s DPSK. It demonstrates that a JD-MLSE using the constructive and destructive components preserves the 3-dB optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) advantage of DPSK over OOK in dispersion-limited optical systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of a shortened MZDI with MLSE for the 10.7-Gb/s DPSK modulation can equalize an accumulated chromatic dispersion of 4000 ps/nm. In addition, we discuss in this paper different MLSE schemes applied to 2 times 10.7-Gb/s DQPSK modulation. It is shown that a joint-symbol MLSE (JS-MLSE) on the balanced outputs of the in-phase and quadrature components gives the best performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5224043/05075662.pdf","startPage":"4583","endPage":"4594","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2025148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2025148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224043","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Estimation for Optical Phase-Shift Keyed Modulation Formats","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Phase estimation","Optical modulation","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Maximum likelihood detection","Chromatic dispersion","Optical devices","Signal to noise ratio","Amplitude modulation","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","compensation","differential phase shift keying","Mach-Zehnder interferometers","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical modulation","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum-likelihood sequence estimation","optical phase-shift keying","modulation format","electronic chromatic dispersion compensation","MLSE","amplitude modulation","OOK","differential phase-shift keying","differential quadrature phase-shift keying","DPSK","DQPSK","joint-decision MLSE","optical signal-to-noise ratio","OSNR","MZDI","bit rate 10.7 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK)","differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK)","joint-decision MLSE (JD-MLSE)","Mach\u2013Zehnder delay interferometer (MZDI)","maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Estimation for Optical Phase-Shift Keyed Modulation Formats","volume":"27","issue":"20","htmlLink":"/document/5075662/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10860193","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Estimation for Optical Phase-Shift Keyed Modulation Formats","sourcePdf":"jlt-malfiad-2025148.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073824S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5224043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5224043","articleId":"5075662","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075665,"authors":[{"name":"Yair Moshe","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Yair Moshe (M'02) received the B.Sc. degree in computer and software engineering from The Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, in 2002, and the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the University of Haifa, Israel, in 2008.

In this paper, a novel fast block-based motion estimation algorithm is proposed. This algorithm uses an efficient projection framework that bounds the distance between a template block and candidate blocks. Fast projection is performed using a family of highly efficient filter kernels-the gray-code kernels-requiring only 2 operations per pixel per kernel. The projection framework is combined with a rejection scheme which allows rapid rejection of candidate blocks that are distant from the template block. The tradeoff between computational complexity and quality of results can be easily controlled in the proposed algorithm; thus, it enables adaptivity to image content to further improve the results. Experiments show that the proposed adaptive algorithm outperforms other popular fast motion estimation algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Kernel","Computational complexity","Video coding","Redundancy","Distortion measurement","Motion measurement","Filters","Adaptive algorithm","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","Hadamard transforms","motion estimation","video coding","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video block motion estimation","video coders","gray-code kernels","block matching","computational complexity","Walsh-Hadamard transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block matching","gray-code kernels (GCK)","motion estimation","video coding","Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform (WHT)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Color","Colorimetry","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Motion","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique","Video Recording"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2025559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5234065/05075665.pdf","startPage":"2243","endPage":"2254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2025559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Block Motion Estimation Based on Gray-Code Kernels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Video Block Motion Estimation Based on Gray-Code Kernels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075665/","volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075665/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10864218","pubMedId":"19535322","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Block Motion Estimation Based on Gray-Code Kernels","sourcePdf":"tip-moshe-2025559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071157S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5234065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5234065","articleId":"5075665","onlineDate":"16 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5075668,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Ranvier","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Ranvier","id":"37270539900"},{"name":"Clemens Icheln","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Icheln","id":"37273178800"},{"name":"Pertti Vainikainen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Pertti","lastName":"Vainikainen","id":"37280837800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5075668","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Mutual information","Information analysis","MIMO","Antenna arrays","Millimeter wave measurements","Wavelength measurement","Antennas and propagation","Personal digital assistants","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave antenna arrays","MIMO communication","switching networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement-based mutual information analysis","MIMO antenna selection","multiple-input-multiple-output antenna selection","signal-to-noise ratio","optimum capacity criterion","lossless switching network","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","channel capacity","millimeter-wave communication","millimeter-wave measurements","multilple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems"]}],"abstract":"The mutual information (MI) of several multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna selection configurations has been studied based on 60-GHz MIMO channel measurement data.

The fabricated optical layer contains Si nanophotodiodes for optical detectors, which are coupled with SiON waveguides using surface-plasmon antennas. Optical signals were introduced to the optical layer and distributed to the Si nanophotodiodes. The output signals from the photodiodes were sent electrically to the transimpedance-amplifier circuitries in the LSI. The signals from the photodiodes triggered of the circuitries at 5 GHz. Since electrooptical modulators consume the most power in on-chip optical interconnect systems and require a large footprint, they are critical to establish on-chip optical interconnection. Two approaches are investigated: 1) an architecture using a fewer number of modulators and 2) high electrooptical coefficient materials.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2020331","startPage":"1186","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5075744/05075754.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2020331","endPage":"1198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Chip Optical Interconnect","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075754/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"On-Chip Optical Interconnect","volume":"97","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5075754/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10704873","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Chip Optical Interconnect","sourcePdf":"jproc-ohashi-2020331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185219S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5075744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5075744","articleId":"5075754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5075759,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew W.

Specifically, we emphasize our recently proposed 5 times 5 matrix switch comprising two-dimensionally cascaded microring resonator-based electrooptic switches coupled to a waveguide cross-grid on a silicon chip. The cross-grid adopts low-loss low-crosstalk multimode-interference-based waveguide crossings. Such a microresonator-based matrix switch offers nonblocking interconnections among multiple inputs and multiple outputs, with the key merits of i) a tens to hundreds of micrometers-scale footprint, ii) gigabit/second-scale data transmission, iii) nanosecond-speed circuit-switching, iv) 100-muW-scale DC power consumption per link, and v) large-scale integration for networks-on-chips applications. We analyze in detail the microring resonator-based cross-grid switch design for high-data-rate signal transmission in the context of our proposed 5 times 5 matrix switch. We also study the feasibility of large-scale integration of the matrix switch.

In order to take advantage of the characteristics of Korean morphology, the proposed models are based on three linguistic units: eojeol (a Korean spacing unit), morpheme, and syllable.

In addition, this approach, without any system modification, is easily applicable to other corpora with different tag sets and annotation guidelines. The three different models and their combinations are evaluated on three corpora over a wide range of conditions. The eojeol-unit and syllable-unit models compensate for the weaknesses of the morpheme-unit model. The eojeol-unit model performed efficiently, and improved the precision. The syllable-unit model improved in precision as well, showing a particularly robust performance in treating unknown words. The proposed approach is also proven to outperform the previous approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Modeling of Korean Morphology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2019922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5067414/05075772.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2019922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5067414","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Modeling of Korean Morphology","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5075772/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10718645","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Modeling of Korean Morphology","sourcePdf":"17tasl05-dlee-2019922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075351S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5067414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5067414","articleId":"5075772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5075778,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Attia","affiliation":["The Engineering Company of the Development of Computer Systems, Research and Development International, Giza, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Attia","id":"37397553700"},{"name":"Mohsen A.

In addition, a calibration technique is presented for single-carrier systems to recover marginally failing devices through analytically correcting performance parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2020718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2020718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5075803/05075813.pdf","startPage":"993","endPage":"1005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Cost Characterization and Calibration of RF Integrated Circuits through -\u2013- Data Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-Cost Characterization and Calibration of RF Integrated Circuits through <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$I$</tex></formula>\u2013<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$Q$</tex></formula> Data Analysis","volume":"28","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705138","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075813/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Cost Characterization and Calibration of RF Integrated Circuits through <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$I$</tex></formula>\u2013<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$Q$</tex></formula> Data Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcad-acar-2020718.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083436S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5075803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5075803","articleId":"5075813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5075820,"authors":[{"name":"Reinhard Wilhelm","affiliation":["University of Saarland, Saarbruecken, Germany","Leibniz Center of Computer Science, Schloss Dagstuhl, Saarland, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5075803/5075820/5075820-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reinhard Wilhelm received the Dr. rer. nat. degree from the Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany, in 1977.","Since 1978, he has been a Professor of computer science with Saarland University, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, where he is currently the Chair for compiler design and programming languages.

Experience with the use of static timing-analysis methods and the tools based on them in the automotive and the aeronautics industries is positive. However, both the precision of the results and the efficiency of the analysis methods are highly dependent on the predictability of the execution platform. In fact, the architecture determines whether a static timing analysis is practically feasible at all and whether the most precise obtainable results are precise enough. Results contained in this paper also show that measurement-based methods still used in industry are not useful for quite commonly used complex processors. This dependence on the architectural development is of growing concern to the developers of timing-analysis tools and their customers, the developers in industry. The problem reaches a new level of severity with the advent of multicore architectures in the embedded domain. This paper describes the architectural influence on static timing analysis and gives recommendations as to profitable and unacceptable architectural features.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2013287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5075803/05075820.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2013287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075803","startPage":"966","endPage":"978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Hierarchies, Pipelines, and Buses for Future Architectures in Time-Critical Embedded Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Memory Hierarchies, Pipelines, and Buses for Future Architectures in Time-Critical Embedded Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075820/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705150","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075820/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Hierarchies, Pipelines, and Buses for Future Architectures in Time-Critical Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"tcad-wilhelm-2013287.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09471S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5075803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"5075803","articleId":"5075820","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075822,"authors":[{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5075803/5075822/5075822-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saibal Mukhopadhyay (S'99\u2013M'07) received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from Jadavpur University, Calcutta, India, in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2006.","He is currently with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, as an Assistant Professor.

The symmetric capacity is the highest rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal probability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to synthesize, out of N independent copies of a given B-DMC W, a second set of N binary-input channels {WN(i)1 les i les N} such that, as N becomes large, the fraction of indices i for which I(WN(i)) is near 1 approaches I(W) and the fraction for which I(WN(i)) is near 0 approaches 1-I(W). The polarized channels {WN(i)} are well-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate 1 through those with capacity near 1 and at rate 0 through the remaining. Codes constructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves that, given any B-DMC W with I(W) > 0 and any target rate R< I(W) there exists a sequence of polar codes {Cfrn;nges1} such that Cfrn has block-length N=2n , rate ges R, and probability of block error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as Pe(N,R) les O(N-1/4) independently of the code rate. This performance is achievable by encoders and decoders with complexity O(N logN) for each.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075875/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","volume":"55","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10705672","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075875/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Channel Polarization: A Method for Constructing Capacity-Achieving Codes for Symmetric Binary-Input Memoryless Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Polarization: A Method for Constructing Capacity-Achieving Codes for Symmetric Binary-Input Memoryless Channels","sourcePdf":"55tit07-earikan-2021379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11525S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5075865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2200","xplore-issue":"5075865","articleId":"5075875","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5075878,"authors":[{"name":"Eirik Rosnes","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Eirik","lastName":"Rosnes","id":"37272234600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5075878","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pairwise error probability","Linear programming","Maximum likelihood decoding","Parity check codes","Linear code","AWGN","Performance analysis","Information theory","Channel state information","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","decoding","error statistics","graph theory","linear codes","linear programming","memoryless systems","parity check codes","Rayleigh channels","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pairwise error probability","linear programming decoding","independent Rayleigh flat-fading channels","binary linear code","memoryless channel","coherent detection","perfect channel state information","parity-check matrix","pseudocode word decoding","all-zero codeword","nonzero coordinates","signal-to-noise ratio","asymptotic decay rate","Tanner graph","Tanner code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear programming decoding","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","pairwise error probability","pseudocodeword","Rayleigh flat-fading channel","stopping set","union bound"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the pairwise error probability (PEP) of a linear programming (LP) decoder for a general binary linear code as formulated by Feldman et al.

Focusing on the uplink of a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) network, a noncooperative game is considered in which each user seeks to choose a transmit power that maximizes its own utility while satisfying its (transmission) delay requirements. The utility function measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy and the user's delay constraint is modeled as an upper bound on the delay outage probability. The Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived, and its existence and uniqueness are proved. Using a large-system analysis, explicit expressions for the utilities achieved at equilibrium are obtained for the matched filter, decorrelating and (linear) minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) multiuser detectors. The effects of delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on the users' utilities (in bits per joule) and network capacity (i.e., the maximum number of users that can be supported) are quantified. Using the proposed framework, the tradeoffs between energy efficiency and delay are quantified in a competitive multiuser setting.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2021374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5075865/05075879.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2021374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075865","startPage":"3220","endPage":"3228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency-Delay Tradeoffs in CDMA Networks: A Game-Theoretic Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency-Delay Tradeoffs in CDMA Networks: A Game-Theoretic Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075879/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705676","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5075879/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency-Delay Tradeoffs in CDMA Networks: A Game-Theoretic Approach","sourcePdf":"55tit07-fmeshkati-2021374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0617S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5075865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5075865","articleId":"5075879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075881,"authors":[{"name":"Georg Schmidt","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Applied Information Theory, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Georg Schmidt (S'02\u2013M'07) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in 2007 from the University of Ulm, Germany, where he worked as a research staff member in the Institute of Telecommunications and Applied Information Theory.","His research interests include coding theory, signal processing, and telecommunication systems.

Properties of the degree distributions, graphical complexity, and the number of fundamental cycles in the bipartite graphs are considered via the derivation of information-theoretic bounds. These bounds are expressed in terms of the target block/bit error probability and the gap (in rate) to capacity. Most of the bounds are general for any decoding algorithm, and some others are proved under belief propagation (BP) decoding. Proving these bounds under a certain decoding algorithm, validates them automatically also under any suboptimal decoding algorithm. A proper modification of these bounds makes them universal for the set of all MBIOS channels which exhibit a given capacity. Bounds on the degree distributions and graphical complexity apply to finite-length LDPC codes and to the asymptotic case of an infinite block length. The bounds are compared with capacity-approaching LDPC code ensembles under BP decoding, and they are shown to be informative and are easy to calculate. Finally, some interesting open problems are considered.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2021305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2021305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5075865/05075886.pdf","startPage":"2956","endPage":"2990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Universal Properties of Capacity-Approaching LDPC Code Ensembles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"On Universal Properties of Capacity-Approaching LDPC Code Ensembles","volume":"55","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075886/","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705681","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075886/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Universal Properties of Capacity-Approaching LDPC Code Ensembles","sourcePdf":"55tit07-isason-2021305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149034S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5075865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5075865","articleId":"5075886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5075887,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth W.

For each user, the transmission of packets follows a specific periodical pattern, called the protocol sequence. Due to the lack of feedback, the beginning of the protocol sequences cannot be synchronized and nonzero relative offsets are inevitable. It results in variation of throughput. In this paper, we investigate optimal protocol sequence sets, in the sense that the throughput variance is zero. Such protocol sequences are said to be shift-invariant (SI). The characterizing properties of SI protocol sequences are presented. We also prove that SI sequences are identifiable, meaning that the receiver is able to determine the sender of each successfully received packet without any packet header. A general construction of SI sequences that meets the lower bound on sequence length is given. Besides, we study the least periods of SI sequences, and show that the least periods must be distinct in some cases. The throughput performance is compared numerically with other protocol sequences.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5075865/05075887.pdf","startPage":"3312","endPage":"3322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2021335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2021335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075865","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shift-Invariant Protocol Sequences for the Collision Channel Without Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Access protocols","Throughput","Multiaccess communication","Time division multiple access","Context","Councils","Reliability engineering","Communication channels","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shift-invariant protocol sequences","collision channel","packet header","throughput performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collision channel without feedback","protocol sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Shift-Invariant Protocol Sequences for the Collision Channel Without Feedback","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5075887/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705682","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shift-Invariant Protocol Sequences for the Collision Channel Without Feedback","sourcePdf":"55tit07-kshum-2021335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072496S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5075865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5075865","articleId":"5075887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075888,"authors":[{"name":"Rafail Ostrovsky","affiliation":["Computer Science Department and Department of Mathematics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Rafail Ostrovsky received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Massachusetts institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, in 1992, in the Theory of Computation Group.","He is a Professor of Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

This solution establishes a constructive analog, for some applications in estimation and control, of the Shannon coding theorem.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2021303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5075865/05075888.pdf","startPage":"2931","endPage":"2941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2021303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-Correcting Codes for Automatic Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Error-Correcting Codes for Automatic Control","volume":"55","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10729401","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075888/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075888/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Correcting Codes for Automatic Control","sourcePdf":"55tit07-lschulman-2021303.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114777S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5075865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5075865","articleId":"5075888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5075892,"authors":[{"name":"Olympia Hadjiliadis","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Olympia Hadjiliadis was born in Athens, Greece, on March the 29, 1976.

These sensors employ cumulative sum (CUSUM) strategies and communicate to a central fusion center by one shot schemes. One shot schemes are schemes in which the sensors communicate with the fusion center only once, via which they signal a detection. The communication is clearly asynchronous and the case is considered in which the fusion center employs a minimal strategy, which means that it declares an alarm when the first communication takes place. It is assumed that the observations received at the sensors are independent and that the time points at which the appearance of a signal can take place are different. Both the cases of the same and different signal distributions across sensors are considered. It is shown that there is no loss of performance of one shot schemes as compared to the centralized case in an extended Lorden min-max sense, since the minimum of N CUSUMs is asymptotically optimal as the mean time between false alarms increases without bound. In the case of different signal distributions the optimal threshold parameters are explicitly computed.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2021311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5075865/05075892.pdf","startPage":"3346","endPage":"3359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2021311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One Shot Schemes for Decentralized Quickest Change Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075892/","displayDocTitle":"One Shot Schemes for Decentralized Quickest Change Detection","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10729402","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075892/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One Shot Schemes for Decentralized Quickest Change Detection","sourcePdf":"55tit07-ohadjiliadis-2021311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156791S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5075865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5075865","articleId":"5075892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075894,"authors":[{"name":"Oren Somekh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Oren Somekh (S'90\u2013M'06) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 1989, 1991, and 2005, respectively.","During 1991\u20131996, he served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the capacity of a Research Engineer.

Each codeword defines a skeleton of a basis for a subspace in reduced row echelon form. This skeleton contains a Ferrers diagram on which we design a rank-metric code. Each such rank-metric code is lifted to a constant-dimension code. The union of these codes is our final constant-dimension code. In particular, the codes constructed recently by Koetter and Kschischang are a subset of our codes. The rank-metric codes used for this construction form a new class of rank-metric codes. We present a decoding algorithm to the constructed codes in the projective space. The efficiency of the decoding depends on the efficiency of the decoding for the constant-weight codes and the rank-metric codes. Finally, we use puncturing on our final constant-dimension codes to obtain large codes in the projective space which are not constant-dimension.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2021376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5075865/05075901.pdf","startPage":"2909","endPage":"2919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2021376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-Correcting Codes in Projective Spaces Via Rank-Metric Codes and Ferrers Diagrams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Error-Correcting Codes in Projective Spaces Via Rank-Metric Codes and Ferrers Diagrams","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5075901/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705663","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Correcting Codes in Projective Spaces Via Rank-Metric Codes and Ferrers Diagrams","sourcePdf":"55tit07-tetzion-2021376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110034S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5075865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5075865","articleId":"5075901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075903,"authors":[{"name":"V.

We first point out that the performance loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in our code designs can be broken into the sum of the packing loss from channel coding and a modulo loss, which is a function of the granular loss from source coding and the target dirty-paper coding rate (or SNR). We then examine practical designs by combining trellis-coded quantization (TCQ) with both systematic and nonsystematic irregular repeat-accumulate (IRA) codes. Like previous approaches, we exploit the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart technique for capacity-approaching IRA code design; but unlike previous approaches, we emphasize the role of strong source coding to achieve as much granular gain as possible using TCQ. Instead of systematic doping, we employ two relatively shifted TCQ codebooks, where the shift is optimized (via tuning the EXIT charts) to facilitate the IRA code design. Our designs synergistically combine TCQ with IRA codes so that they work together as well as they do individually. By bringing together TCQ (the best quantizer from the source coding community) and EXIT chart-based IRA code designs (the best from the channel coding community), we are able to approach the theoretical limit of dirty-paper coding. For example, at 0.25 bit per symbol (b/s), our best code design (with 2048-state TCQ) performs only 0.630 dB away from the Shannon capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5075865/05075904.pdf","startPage":"3013","endPage":"3031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2021319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2021319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075865","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Capacity Dirty-Paper Code Design: A Source-Channel Coding Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Channel coding","Source coding","Turbo codes","Sun","MIMO","Modulation coding","Performance loss","Signal to noise ratio","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","quantisation (signal)","source coding","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-capacity dirty-paper code","source-channel coding","extrinsic information transfer","packing loss","modulo loss","trellis-coded quantization","irregular repeat-accumulate codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dirty-paper coding","extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart","irregular repeat\u2013accumulate (IRA) codes","modulo loss","packing loss","trellis-coded quantization (TCQ)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Near-Capacity Dirty-Paper Code Design: A Source-Channel Coding Approach","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5075904/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705665","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Capacity Dirty-Paper Code Design: A Source-Channel Coding Approach","sourcePdf":"55tit07-zxiong-2021319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112901S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5075865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5075865","articleId":"5075904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075905,"authors":[{"name":"Huseyin Balli","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Lefke, Turkey"],"bio":{"p":["Huseyin Balli received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Eastern Mediterranean University, Cyprus, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 2002, 2004, and 2008, respectively.","He received the Cyprus Graduate Fellowship for 2002\u20132004 and the USC Viterbi School of Engineering Dean's Fellowship for 2004\u20132005.

(IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, October 2006) where the main results are upper bounds for the failure probability of the code. In this paper, these bounds are improved and tightness of the new bounds is studied by analyzing the limiting behavior of the failure probability as the field size goes to infinity. In the linear random coding setting for single source multicast, the minimum distance of the code defined in Zhang, (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, January 2008) is a random variable taking nonnegative integer values that satisfy the inequality in the Singleton bound recently established in Yeung and Cai (Communications in Information and Systems, 2006) for network error correction codes. We derive a bound on the probability mass function of the minimum distance of the random linear network code based on our improved upper bounds for the failure probability. Codes having the highest possible minimum distance in the Singleton bound are called maximum distance separable (MDS). The bound on the field size required for the existence of MDS codes reported in Zhang, (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, January 2008) and Matsumoto (arXiv:cs.IT/0610121, Oct. 2006) suggests that such codes exist only when field size is large. Define the degradation of a code as the difference between the highest possible minimum distance in the Singleton bound and the actual minimum distance of the code. The bound for the probability mass function of the minimum distance leads to a bound on the field size required for the existence of network error correction codes with a given maximum degradation. The result shows that allowing minor degradation reduces the field size required dramatically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10705669","htmlLink":"/document/5075905/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On Randomized Linear Network Codes and Their Error Correction Capabilities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Randomized Linear Network Codes and Their Error Correction Capabilities","sourcePdf":"55tit06-zzhang-2018173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099744S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5075865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5075865","articleId":"5075905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075914,"authors":[{"name":"Sandipan Mishra","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Sandipan","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37532698000"},{"name":"Masayoshi Tomizuka","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Masayoshi","lastName":"Tomizuka","id":"37281933000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4435"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-014X"}],"articleNumber":"5075914","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":652},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ies/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division","url":"http://divisions.asme.org/dscd"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"  IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ncsu.edu/IEEE-RAS/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, an iterative learning controller (ILC) that uses partial but most pertinent information in the error signal from previous cycles is employed for precision control of a wafer stage. Typically, ILC schemes use the error signal from the previous cycle for updating the control input. This error contains both repetitive and nonrepetitive components. The nonrepetitive components of the error cause degradation of performance of the ILC scheme. Based on structural information about the plant and the disturbances, we can determine some basis functions along which the repetitive error is concentrated. This information is extracted by projecting the error signal onto the subspace spanned by these basis functions. The projected error signal is then used in the ILC update law. Stability and convergence conditions are presented for this projection-based ILC update law. The proposed idea is motivated by precision control of a wafer stage. For a constant velocity scan by the wafer stage, the major sources of repetitive error are found to be phase-mismatch and force ripple. These effects are mathematically modeled to obtain the subspace spanned by them. The projection-based ILC scheme using this subspace is then implemented on a prototype one DOF stage and its performance is compared to the standard ILC scheme that uses a frequency-domain filtering to remove nonrepetitive components of the error.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5075906/05075914.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"393","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2008.2007302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2008.2007302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projection-Based Iterative Learning Control for Wafer Scanner Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Error correction","Degradation","Data mining","Stability","Convergence","Semiconductor device modeling","Mathematical model","Prototypes","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial control","learning (artificial intelligence)","motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative learning control","wafer scanner systems","error signal","precision motion control","subspace projection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative learning control","precision motion control","subspace projection","wafer stage control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Projection-Based Iterative Learning Control for Wafer Scanner Systems","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5075914/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10705037","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projection-Based Iterative Learning Control for Wafer Scanner Systems","sourcePdf":"tmech-mishra-2007302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061764S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5075906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5075906","articleId":"5075914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5075969,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel R.

Level-sensitive latches, edge-triggered master-slave flip-flops, and pulse-triggered flip-flops comprise the pipeline memory classes considered in this paper. TPDICE basic cells are utilized to achieve fault-tolerance and transient bypass capability. A number of single-ended and differential structures are presented and evaluated with respect to performance, energy consumption, and complexity. In addition, the SEU and SET tolerance of these structures is demonstrated. All evaluations are based off simulations performed in 90 nm CMOS. Accompanying the above evaluations, this paper also addresses concerns of multiple bit upset (MBU) affecting these designs at the 90 nm technology node. Novel hardened-by-design techniques are introduced to address these concerns, and their effectiveness is quantified.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay and Energy Analysis of SEU and SET-Tolerant Pipeline Latches and Flip-Flops","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2019590","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5075936/05075969.pdf","startPage":"1618","endPage":"1628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2019590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075936","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Delay and Energy Analysis of SEU and SET-Tolerant Pipeline Latches and Flip-Flops","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5075969/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10729394","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay and Energy Analysis of SEU and SET-Tolerant Pipeline Latches and Flip-Flops","sourcePdf":"tns-blum-2019590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166414S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5075936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5075936","articleId":"5075969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5075982,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Bertuccio","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Information Science, Politecnico di Milano and INFN Milano, Como, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Bertuccio","id":"37299391300"},{"name":"Stefano Caccia","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Milan, Italy","Polo Regionale di Como.

The LabPET scanner, designed at the Universite de Sherbrooke, is one such device. It is built around dual LYSO/LGSO scintillators in a phoswich arrangement coupled to Avalanche Photodiodes (APD) and combined with highly parallel readout and processing electronics. This approach enables the implementation of advanced real time digital signal processing methods to compute energy resolution, crystal identification and the arrival time of events. Timing extraction represents the highest challenge because of the low sampling frequency (45 MHz), the quantization error and the presence of a Zero Order Hold (ZOH) in the system. The aim of this paper is to present a method to increase coincidence time accuracy by adequately addressing each of these limitations. The proposed method uses a Deconvolution concept based on adaptive filter theory preceded by Cubic Spline interpolation to improve digital timing performance. The method achieves 4.5 ns, 8.2 ns, and 6.5 ns timing resolution with LYSO-LYSO, LGSO-LGSO and mixed crystals phoswich coincidences, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Deconvolution Concept Combined With Cubic Spline Interpolation to Improve Timing With Phoswich PET Detectors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2015946","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5075929/05075999.pdf","startPage":"581","endPage":"587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2015946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5075999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5075999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Signal Deconvolution Concept Combined With Cubic Spline Interpolation to Improve Timing With Phoswich PET Detectors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5075999/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10705523","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Deconvolution Concept Combined With Cubic Spline Interpolation to Improve Timing With Phoswich PET Detectors","sourcePdf":"tns-semmaoui-2015946.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075427S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5075929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5075929","articleId":"5075999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5076024,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan-Hao Su","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuan-Hao","lastName":"Su","id":"37830657500"},{"name":"Liang-Chih Wu","affiliation":["National PET/Cyclotron Center, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Liang-Chih","lastName":"Wu","id":"37277031400"},{"name":"Jih-Shian Lee","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jih-Shian","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280316300"},{"name":"Ren-Shyan Liu","affiliation":["Medical School, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan","National PET/Cyclotron Center, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ren-Shyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275366700"},{"name":"Jyh-Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan","Department of Education and Research, Taipei City Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyh-Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37068895500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"5076024","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Animals","Positron emission tomography","Image reconstruction","Artificial neural networks","Samarium","Imaging phantoms","Digital images","Image generation","Stimulated emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","medical image processing","Monte Carlo methods","neural nets","phantoms","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D small animal PET reconstruction","Monte Carlo simulation","artificial neural network","2D system matrix","micropositron emission tomography","ADALINE network","multiline-source phantom","2D-ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm","image quality reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network (ANN)","image reconstruction","positron emission tomography (PET)","PET reconstruction","small animal imaging","system matrix"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076024","abstract":"The aim of this study was to improve image quality of statistical reconstruction by using the 2-D system matrix (SM) trained with an artificial neural network (ANN).

an electronic device. In IEEM technique, a broad (not focused) ion beam is sent onto the device under test (DUT). Secondary electrons emitted by the target surface during each ion impact are collected and focused by a system of electrostatic lenses and finally imaged by a high-rate and high-resolution position detector. We will report on the IEEM working at the SIRAD irradiation facility located at the 15 MV Tandem of INFN Legnaro National Laboratories. To estimate the IEEM resolution, a SDRAM is a good candidate to be used as a reference target, thanks to the micrometric feature size of the array of memory cells and the precise knowledge of their physical locations.

In this work we evaluate two sampling techniques that can be applied during calibrations for pixelated detector designs in order to improve the reconstructed spatial resolution. The inter-crystal positioning technique utilizes sub-sampling in the crystal flood map to better sample the Compton scatter events in the detector. The Compton scatter rejection technique, on the other hand, rejects those events that are located further from individual crystal centers in the flood map. We performed Monte Carlo simulations followed by measurements on two whole-body scanners for point source data.

Our results show that near the center of the scanner, inter-crystal positioning technique leads to a gain of about 0.5-mm in reconstructed spatial resolution (FWHM) for both scanner designs. In a small animal LYSO scanner the resolution improves from 1.9-mm to 1.6-mm with the inter-crystal technique. The Compton scatter rejection technique shows higher gains in spatial resolution but at the cost of reduction in scanner sensitivity. The inter-crystal positioning technique represents a modest acquisition software modification for an improvement in spatial resolution, but at a cost of potentially longer data correction and reconstruction times. The Compton scatter rejection technique, while also requiring a modest acquisition software change with no increased data correction and reconstruction times, will be useful in applications where the scanner sensitivity is very high and larger improvements in spatial resolution are desirable.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2013389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2013389","startPage":"596","endPage":"601","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5075929/05076098.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Spatial Resolution in PET Scanners Using Sampling Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved Spatial Resolution in PET Scanners Using Sampling Techniques","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","volume":"56","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5076098/","accessionNumber":"10705536","pubMedId":"19779586","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076098/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Spatial Resolution in PET Scanners Using Sampling Techniques","sourcePdf":"tns-surti-2013389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067137S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5075929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5075929","articleId":"5076098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5076126,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Dong","affiliation":["Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Dong","id":"37401680200"},{"name":"Xiaojin Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37407401600"},{"name":"Junting Feng","affiliation":["Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junting","lastName":"Feng","id":"37399559900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"5076126","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":799},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076126","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Nuclear power generation","Output feedback","Fission reactors","Level control","Cooling","Turbines","Blades","Character generation","Nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blades","feedback","fission reactor cooling","light water reactors","nonlinear control systems","nuclear engineering computing","nuclear power stations","nuclear reactor steam generators","turbomachinery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["water-level control","U-tube steam generator","nuclear power plants","pressurized-water nuclear reactor","reactor cooling","turbine blades","effective nonlinear water-level controller","feedback dissipation control","nonlinear systems","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hamiltonian system","nonlinear control","output feedback dissipation","steam generator","water-level control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2019593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5075936/05076126.pdf","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2019593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Water-Level Control for the U-Tube Steam Generator of Nuclear Power Plants Based on Output Feedback Dissipation","abstract":"U-tube steam generator (UTSG) is one of the most important facilities in a pressurized-water nuclear reactor.

The simulation results indicate that the strategy produces a high quality of the reconstructed video data compared with uniform protection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Error Protection of H.264/AVC Video Using Hierarchical 16-QAM","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2009.68","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076161/5076162/05076199.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2009.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Error Protection of H.264/AVC Video Using Hierarchical 16-QAM","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5076199/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719767","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Error Protection of H.264/AVC Video Using Hierarchical 16-QAM","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"3638a197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048694S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076161","isNumber":"5076162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076161","xplore-issue":"5076162","articleId":"5076199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5076200,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37933026100"},{"name":"Baoming Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Baoming","lastName":"Bai","id":"37290479800"},{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","id":"37292398300"},{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279526900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4000-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3638-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"5076200","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":392},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Medical services","Sum product algorithm","Turbo codes","Constellation diagram","Galois fields","Error correction codes","AWGN channels","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","decoding","error statistics","matrix algebra","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["q-ary irregular repeat-accumulate codes","excellent error correcting capability","LDPC codes","conventional binary IRA codes","progressive edge growth algorithm","parity check matrices","decoding performance","sum-product algorithm","turbo codes","bit error ratio","AWGN channels","extended min-sum decoding algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["repeat accumulate code","nonbinary LDPC code","progressive edge growth","EMS algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with the construction of a class of nonbinary irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) codes. Since they are defined on the finite field GF(q) (q>2), we will refer to the constructed codes as q-ary IRA (QIRA) codes. While preserving the excellent error correcting capability of q-ary LDPC codes, QIRA codes can be efficiently encoded like conventional binary IRA codes. By adopting the progressive edge growth (PEG) algorithm to construct the parity check matrices, we can achieve the increased girth of their factor graphs and improved decoding performance. Simulation results show that, using the sum-product algorithm on GF(q), QIRA codes outperform binary LDPC codes and turbo codes in terms of bit error ratio and frame error ratio on AWGN channels. Especially, they could achieve excellent error performance when combined with high order modulations. Feasibility study indicates, with the use of the extended min-sum (EMS) decoding algorithm, QIRA codes are competitive candidates for practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2009.74","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076161/5076162/05076200.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2009.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076162","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of q-ary Irregular Repeat-Accumulate Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of q-ary Irregular Repeat-Accumulate Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076200/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719768","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5076200/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of q-ary Irregular Repeat-Accumulate Codes","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"3638a201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043911S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076161","isNumber":"5076162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076161","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5076162","articleId":"5076200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5076202,"authors":[{"name":"Hei Yong-qiang","affiliation":["State Key Lab.of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, ShaanXi, China"],"firstName":"Hei","lastName":"Yong-qiang","id":"38273827100"},{"name":"LiXiao-hui","affiliation":["State Key Lab.of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, ShaanXi, China"],"lastName":"LiXiao-hui","id":"37086912008"},{"name":"YiKe-chu","affiliation":["State Key Lab.of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, ShaanXi, China"],"lastName":"YiKe-chu","id":"37086907979"},{"name":"Li Wen-tao","affiliation":["State Key Lab.of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, ShaanXi, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wen-tao","id":"38270913500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4000-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3638-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"5076202","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Particle swarm optimization","Downlink","Fading","Scheduling algorithm","Frequency","Base stations","Linear antenna arrays","Intserv networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multi-access systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser","MIMO broadcast system","grouping strategy","particle swarm optimization","optimal exhaustive search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["downlink","grouping","capacity","particle swarm optimization"]}],"abstract":"A new grouping strategy based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for the multiuser MIMO broadcast systems in this paper.

Most existing reputation models used for reliability evaluation ignore the time influence. And very few works use a robust genetic algorithm to optimize both time and reliability for a workflow application. Hence, in this paper, we propose the reliability-driven (RD) reputation, which is time dependent and can be used to evaluate a taskpsilas reliability directly using the exponential failure model. Based on the RD reputation, we also propose knowledge-based genetic algorithm (KBGA) to optimize both time and reliability for a workflow application. KBGA uses heuristics to accelerate the evolution process without giving invalid solutions. Our experiments show that the RD reputation can improve the reliability of a workflow application with more accurate reputation, while the KBGA can evolve to better scheduling solutions more quickly than traditional genetic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2009.21","startPage":"411","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076161/5076162/05076228.pdf","endPage":"418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2009.21","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076228/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-Driven Reputation Based Scheduling for Public-Resource Computing Using GA","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5076228/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10719796","publicationDate":"May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-Driven Reputation Based Scheduling for Public-Resource Computing Using GA","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"3638a411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058894S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076161","isNumber":"5076162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076161","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5076162","articleId":"5076228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5076240,"authors":[{"name":"Amel Bouzeghoub","affiliation":["CNRS Samovar, TELECOM & Management SudParis, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Amel","lastName":"Bouzeghoub","id":"37265370700"},{"name":"Kien Ngoc Do","affiliation":["CNRS Samovar, TELECOM & Management SudParis, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Kien Ngoc","lastName":"Do","id":"37942031100"},{"name":"Leandro Krug Wives","affiliation":["Instituto de Inform\u00e1tica, UFRGS Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leandro Krug","lastName":"Wives","id":"37375326000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4000-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3638-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"5076240","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":211},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076240","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recommender systems","Information systems","Conference management","Environmental management","Resource management","Telecommunication network management","Prototypes","Computer peripherals","Educational institutions","Smart cards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["educational administrative data processing","information filtering","information filters","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["situation-aware adaptive information recommendation","mobile application","educational campus environment","recommender system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile applications","Recommender system","Situation","Awareness"]}],"abstract":"Users in a campus need information about relevant individuals, buildings, events and available resources.

In this paper, based on ICI coefficients analysis, a novel precoder design scheme is proposed for mitigation ICI in OFDM mobile systems. In this technique, precoder matrix is designed by linear counteraction and inserted in transmitter. Computer simulation results show that this new scheme can effectively reduce ICI and significantly improve the carrier-interference power ratio. Compared with existing ICI mitigation schemes with channel estimation, the proposed scheme has lower computational complexity, and compared with self-cancellation scheme, the bandwidth efficiency can be improved. The proposed scheme has also better convergence stability for time-varying frequency selective fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2009.37","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076161/5076162/05076268.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2009.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of Intercarrier Interference Based on General Precoder Design in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076268/","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of Intercarrier Interference Based on General Precoder Design in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719836","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5076268/","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of Intercarrier Interference Based on General Precoder Design in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"3638a705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046122S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076161","isNumber":"5076162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076161","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5076162","articleId":"5076268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5076288,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Yamada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Miyagi, Japan","Network Security Laboratory, KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37288890400"},{"name":"Yutaka Miyake","affiliation":["Network Security Laboratory, KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yutaka","lastName":"Miyake","id":"37290507700"},{"name":"Masahiro Terabe","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Terabe","id":"37940513900"},{"name":"Kazuo Hashimoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37292252600"},{"name":"Nei Kato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Nei","lastName":"Kato","id":"37265717700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4000-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3638-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"5076288","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network servers","Web server","Internet","Postal services","Monitoring","Telecommunication traffic","Large-scale systems","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","IP networks","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","DNS traffic","large-scale networks","frequent host selection","domain name system","Internet"]}],"abstract":"DNS is one of the internet's fundamental building blocks, used by various applications such as web and mail transfer. Therefore, monitoring DNS traffic has potential to detect host anomalies such as spammers and infected hosts in a network. However, previous works assume a small number of hosts or target on domain name anomalies, so that they cannot be applied to a large-scale networks due to performance issues. A large number of hosts and long-term tracing consume computational resources and make real-time analysis difficult. In this paper, we propose anomaly detection for DNS servers using frequent host selection, which selects only potential hosts and does not depend on the number of hosts. We evaluate the proposed system using DNS traffic for 6 months of tracing, and show that the system can feasibly handle hosts in the dataset and detect anomalies, such as mail servers suffering from spam and DNS servers are configured incorrectly.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2009.93","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076161/5076162/05076288.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2009.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076162","startPage":"853","endPage":"860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection for DNS Servers Using Frequent Host Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection for DNS Servers Using Frequent Host Selection","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076288/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719856","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5076288/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection for DNS Servers Using Frequent Host Selection","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"3638a853.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062572S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076161","isNumber":"5076162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076161","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5076162","articleId":"5076288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5076342,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Salvador","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es-Aveiro Pole, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Salvador","id":"37429195600"},{"name":"Ant\u00f3nio Nogueira","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es-Aveiro Pole, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ant\u00f3nio","lastName":"Nogueira","id":"37413241100"},{"name":"Ulisses Fran\u00e7a","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es-Aveiro Pole, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ulisses","lastName":"Fran\u00e7a","id":"37936401900"},{"name":"Rui Valadas","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es-Aveiro Pole, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Valadas","id":"37347800100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3839-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3612-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5076342","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":401},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Communication system traffic control","Intrusion detection","Protection","Personal communication networks","IP networks","Electronic mail","Unsolicited electronic mail","Local area networks","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","invasive software","local area networks","neural nets","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zombie detection","neural networks","personal Internet security","corporate Internet security","zombie PC","malicious software","local area network","historical traffic profiles","illicit network application","subseven backdoor","licit network application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Zombie","botnet","illicit traffic","neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076342","abstract":"One of the most important threats to personal and corporate Internet security is the proliferation of zombie PCs operating as an organized network. Zombie detection is currently performed at the host level and/or network level, but these options have some important drawbacks: antivirus, anti-spyware and personal firewalls are ineffective in the detection of hosts that are compromised via new or target-specific malicious software, while network firewalls and intrusion detection systems were developed to protect the network from external attacks but they were not designed to detect and protect against vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to detect zombie PCs based on the historical traffic profiles presented by \"licit\" and \"illicit\" network applications. The evaluation of the proposed methodology relies on traffic traces obtained in a controlled environment and composed by licit traffic measured from normal activity of network applications and malicious traffic synthetically generated using the subseven backdoor. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology is able to achieve good identification results, being at the same time computationally efficient and easy to deploy in real network scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICIMP.2009.10","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076330/5076331/05076342.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMP.2009.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Framework for Zombie Detection Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Framework for Zombie Detection Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10719872","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5076342/","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Framework for Zombie Detection Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Venice/Mestre, Italy","sourcePdf":"3612a014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109821S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076330","isNumber":"5076331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076330","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5076331","articleId":"5076342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5076377,"authors":[{"name":"Huaxi Gu","affiliation":["ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Huaxi","lastName":"Gu","id":"37398871900"},{"name":"Kwai Hung Mo","affiliation":["ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kwai Hung","lastName":"Mo","id":"37547118000"},{"name":"Jiang Xu","affiliation":["ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37421840600"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["EE, Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37536599900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4408-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3684-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"5076377","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Multiprocessing systems","Optical interconnections","Energy consumption","Network-on-a-chip","Microcavities","Bandwidth","Optical losses","Insertion loss","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated optoelectronics","low-power electronics","micromechanical resonators","network routing","network-on-chip","optical interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power low-cost optical router","optical networks-on-chip","multiprocessor systems-on-chip","metallic interconnects","communication bandwidth","silicon microresonators","microresonator-based routers","power consumption","optical power insertion loss","optical crossbar router","end-to-end delay","network throughput","size 45 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical network on chip","optical router","optical interconnect","multiprocessor","system on chip","low power","loss","microresonator","network on chip"]}],"abstract":"Networks-on-chip (NoCs) can improve the communication bandwidth and power efficiency of multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoC). However, traditional metallic interconnects consume significant amount of power to deliver even higher communication bandwidth required in the near future. Optical NoCs are based on optical interconnects and optical routers, and have significant bandwidth and power advantages. This paper proposed a high-performance low-power low-cost optical router, Cygnus, for optical NoCs. Cygnus is non-blocking and based on silicon microresonators. We compared Cygnus with other microresonator-based routers, and analyzed their power consumption, optical power insertion loss, and the number of microresonators used in detail. The results show that Cygnus has the lowest power consumption and losses, and requires the lowest number of microresonators. For example, Cygnus has 50% less power consumption, 51% less optical power insertion loss, and 20% less microresonators than the optimized traditional optical crossbar router. Comparing to a high-performance 45nm electronic router, Cygnus consumes 96% less power. Moreover, the passive routing feature of Cygnus guarantees that, while using dimension order routing algorithm, the maximum power consumption to route a packet through a network is a small constant number, regardless of the network size. For example, the maximum power consumption is 4.80fJ/bit under current technologies. We simulated and analyzed an 8 times 8 2D mesh NoC built from Cygnus and showed the end-to-end delay and network throughput under different offered loads and packet sizes.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2009.19","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076366/5076367/05076377.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2009.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076367","startPage":"19","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-power Low-cost Optical Router for Optical Networks-on-Chip in Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Low-power Low-cost Optical Router for Optical Networks-on-Chip in Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076377/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719915","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5076377/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-power Low-cost Optical Router for Optical Networks-on-Chip in Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3684a019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050095S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076366","isNumber":"5076367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076366","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5076367","articleId":"5076377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5076383,"authors":[{"name":"Renaud Santoro","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes I, France"],"firstName":"Renaud","lastName":"Santoro","id":"37580699600"},{"name":"Olivier Sentieys","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes I, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Sentieys","id":"37281694500"},{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Roy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274779000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4408-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3684-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"5076383","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":547},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random number generation","Field programmable gate arrays","Energy consumption","Hardware","Circuit testing","Batteries","Very large scale integration","Application specific integrated circuits","Cryptography","Computer Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","random number generation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based true random number generator","postprocessing unit","enhanced TRNG data rate","noise source","data sampling","field-programmable gate array","embedded security chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["true random number generator","randomness evaluation","statistical test","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Many embedded security chips require a high-quality digital True Random Number Generator (TRNG). Recently, some new TRNGs have been proposed in the literature, innovating by their new architectures.

As a result, the TRNG data rate is enhanced and the produced random bits only depend on the noise source and its sampling. However, selecting a TRNG can be a delicate problem. In a hardware context (e.g. Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) implementation), the design area and power consumption are important criterions.

This standard reaches the highest compression rates when compared to the previous standards. On the other hand, it has a high computational complexity. This high computational complexity makes it difficult the development of software applications running in a current processor when high definitions videos are considered. Thus, hardware implementations become essential. Addressing the hardware architectures, this work presents the architectural design for the variable block size motion estimation (VBSME) defined in the H.264/AVC standard.

These stacked die are tightly integrated with through-silicon vias and promise significant power and area reductions by replacing long global wires with short vertical connections. This technology necessitates that neighboring logical blocks exist on different layers in the stack. However, such functional partitions disable intra-chip communication pre-bond and thus disrupt traditional test techniques. Previous work has described a general test architecture that enables pre-bond testability of an architecturally partitioned 3D processor and provided mechanisms for basic layer functionality. This work proposes new test methods for designs partitioned at the circuits level,in which the gates and transistors of individual circuits could be split across multiple die layers. We investigated a bit-partitioned adder unit and a port-split register file, which represents the most difficult circuit-partitioned design to test pre-bond but which is used widely in many circuits. Two layouts of each circuit, planar and 3D, are produced. Our experiments verify the performance and power results and examine the test coverage achieved.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Integrated circuit testing","Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Integrated circuit technology","Stacking","Silicon","Through-silicon vias","Wires","Design methodology","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","design for testability","integrated circuit design","integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["testing circuit partitioned","3D IC designs","3D integration","emerging technology","vertical stacking","multiple silicon die","bit-partitioned adder unit","port-split register file"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DFT","Die Stacking","3D ICs","Memory Test","BIST"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076397","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2009.48","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076366/5076367/05076397.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2009.48","startPage":"139","endPage":"144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076367","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing Circuit-Partitioned 3D IC Designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Testing Circuit-Partitioned 3D IC Designs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076397/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5076397/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719899","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing Circuit-Partitioned 3D IC Designs","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3684a139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067678S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076366","isNumber":"5076367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076366","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5076367","articleId":"5076397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5076406,"authors":[{"name":"Sungmin Bae","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sungmin","lastName":"Bae","id":"37877464600"},{"name":"Krishnan Ramakrishnan","affiliation":["Dept. of Comput.

Leakage power dissipation is especially problematic for FPGAs due to their reconfigurable nature and large number of inactive resources. Body biasing is an efficient technique to reduce leakage current which has been widely adopted in 45 nm technology low power architectures.FPGAs with coarse grained body bias control only incurred about 10% of the area overhead while increasing the granularity to the finest level dramatically increases the area overhead over 100%. However, the coarse grained body bias control FPGA may not result in satisfactory leakage power reduction since all the paths passing a resource must have enough slacks. To overcome the assignment limitation, we propose a novel FPGA architecture which uses body biasing technique and clock skew scheduling at a coarse grained architecture level. Clock skew scheduling technique only incurs 3.35% of additional area overhead in order to distribute slack to the resource instead of increasing the minimum body-bias granularity. Further, we propose a body bias assignment algorithm to leverage the proposed architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieved an average leakage reduction of about 76% as compared to 61% of coarse grained architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Low Area Overhead Body Bias FPGA Architecture for Low Power Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2009.51","startPage":"193","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2009.51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076367","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076366/5076367/05076406.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Low Area Overhead Body Bias FPGA Architecture for Low Power Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5076406/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719908","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Low Area Overhead Body Bias FPGA Architecture for Low Power Applications","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3684a193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064967S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076366","isNumber":"5076367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076366","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5076367","articleId":"5076406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5076410,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Li","id":"37407153400"},{"name":"Haiwen Xi","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Haiwen","lastName":"Xi","id":"37304789300"},{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281023800"},{"name":"John Stricklin","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Stricklin","id":"37936546000"},{"name":"Xiaobin Wang","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311498100"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["ECSE, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4408-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3684-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"5076410","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":468},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Magnetic tunneling","Magnetization","Random access memory","Scalability","Space technology","Thermal conductivity","Magnetic switching","Current","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","magnetoelectronics","MRAM devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal-assisted spin transfer torque memory","STT-RAM","random access memory","nonvolatile memory technology","finite element simulation","thermal dynamics","scalability","programming process","memory element dimension","resistance-area product","writeability","MRAM","magnetic random access memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["STT-RAM","thermal-assisted"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076410","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076366/5076367/05076410.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2009.17","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2009.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076367","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal-Assisted Spin Transfer Torque Memory (STT-RAM) Cell Design Exploration","abstract":"Thermal-assisted spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) has been considered as a promising candidate of next-generation nonvolatile memory technology.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first physical design tool to consider variation in the routing and timing analysis of 3D FPGAs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719944","htmlLink":"/document/5076424/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Variation Aware Routing for Three-Dimensional FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variation Aware Routing for Three-Dimensional FPGAs","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3684a298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079371S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076366","isNumber":"5076367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076366","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5076367","articleId":"5076424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5076433,"authors":[{"name":"Shane Greenstein","affiliation":["USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/40/5076428/5076433/5076433-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":[]},"firstName":"Shane","lastName":"Greenstein","id":"37284614200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-1732"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4143"}],"articleNumber":"5076433","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076433","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FCC","Licenses","Telephony","Auditory system","Elevators","Subscriptions","Digital TV","Delay","Proposals","Asset management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum allocation","wireless subscribers","wireless phone","mobile telephony","regulatory mechanism","spectrum auction","analog television"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MM.2009.49","publicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","pdfPath":"/iel5/40/5076428/05076433.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MM.2009.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Revolution in Spectrum Allocation","abstract":"At the end of 2007 (the latest data) the US Federal Communications Commission estimates there were 263 million wireless subscribers (almost 2.3 subscriptions per household in the US). Subscribers used an average of 769 minutes per month, generating US$0.06 average revenue per minute for all traffic ($0.05 for voice traffic). The FCC also estimates that 14.5 percent of US households received their primary service exclusively through a wireless phone. A related revolution has largely gone unnoticed. Since 1994, the US has assigned spectrum for mobile telephony through auctions instead of the traditional regulatory mechanisms. The transition from analog to digital television freed up additional spectrum, giving the FCC the opportunity to set up an auction in the 700-MHz range. That spectrum auction ended in March 2008. The spectrum will go into use in June 2009, after analog television retires.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076433/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2009","publicationDate":"May-June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5076433/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10720746","volume":"29","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Revolution in Spectrum Allocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Revolution in Spectrum Allocation","sourcePdf":"mmi2009030004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02152S","chronDate":"May-June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"40","isNumber":"5076428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5076428","articleId":"5076433","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5076434,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Levy","affiliation":["Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium and Multicore Association, El Dorado Hills, CA"],"bio":{"p":["Markus Levy is president of the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium and the Multicore Association, and chair of Multicore Expo.

Rather than using the cyclically permutable (CP) code in the secondary synchronization channel (S-SCH) to simultaneously acquire frame boundary and scrambling code group, the new synchronization algorithm implements the same function with less system complexity. New secondary synchronization codes (SSC) are redesigned by splitting them into two sub-sequences. The counter logic unit and BCH decoder make the new algorithm avoid involved and time-costly Reed-Solomon (RS) code comparisons. Analysis and simulation results show that the synchronization error rate (SER) yielded by the new algorithm in Rayleigh fading channels is close to that of the conventional algorithm in the standard. This new synchronization algorithm reduces system complexities, shortens the mean acquisition time and can be implemented in the slot-based cell-search pipeline.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Code Synchronization Algorithm for the Secondary Cell-search Stage in WCDMA","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2009.130","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076789/5076790/05076817.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2009.130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"New Code Synchronization Algorithm for the Secondary Cell-search Stage in WCDMA","conferenceDate":"27-28 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5076817/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10720205","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Code Synchronization Algorithm for the Secondary Cell-search Stage in WCDMA","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3522a087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090636S","chronDate":"27-28 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076789","isNumber":"5076790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076789","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5076790","articleId":"5076817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5076818,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Min Li","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Guidance Eng, National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Min","lastName":"Li","id":"37291256100"},{"name":"Jia-Chyi Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Guidance Eng, National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Chyi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37655505400"},{"name":"I-Tseng Tang","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Guidance Eng, National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Tseng","lastName":"Tang","id":"37268135700"},{"name":"Yu-Hong Huang","affiliation":["Department of Environment and Energy, National University of Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Hong","lastName":"Huang","id":"37933503800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3522-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5076818","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas","Computational complexity","Maximum likelihood estimation","AWGN","Underwater communication","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","error statistics","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group sphere decoder","MIMO wireless communication system","multiple input multiple output system","multiple antennas","BER","bit error rate","signal detection algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Sphere Deoder"]}],"abstract":"Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system employs multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver to improve the BER (Bit Error Rate) and system capacity.

Sensor data collected by these platforms is usually internally recorded and then transmitted via a cable or wireless communication. Traditional acoustic links are fundamentally bandwidth limited to low rates of bit per second (bps). Optical methods are well posed to provide an alternative solution for high bandwidth communications in undersea. In this paper, we examined several modulation technologies for undersea environment application. Through modeling and simulation, the advantages and limitations of these modulating configurations are discussed. It is demonstrated that the pulse position modulation (PPM) is better suited for low powered undersea systems and the phase shift keying (PSK) yields the best performance in term of bandwidth and error performance with poor power efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2009.97","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076789/5076790/05076827.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2009.97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Evaluation of Modulation Techniques for Underwater Wireless Optical Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Evaluation of Modulation Techniques for Underwater Wireless Optical Communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10720216","htmlLink":"/document/5076827/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Evaluation of Modulation Techniques for Underwater Wireless Optical Communications","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3522a138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086072S","chronDate":"27-28 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076789","isNumber":"5076790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076789","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5076790","articleId":"5076827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5076828,"authors":[{"name":"He Chunlong","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Chunlong","id":"37936501000"},{"name":"Hao Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Li","id":"37935520100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3522-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5076828","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":382},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Interpolation","Frequency estimation","Frequency conversion","AWGN","Information science","Fading","Digital video broadcasting","Communication system software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","interpolation","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-aided channel estimation technique","OFDM system","MMSE estimator","LS estimation","BER performance","time domain interpolation","comb-type pilot","linear interpolation","second order interpolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM","LS","MMSE","time domain interpolation"]}],"abstract":"The channel estimation techniques for OFDM systems based on pilot-aided are investigated.

Frequency offset is a factor which destroys the orthogonality of subcarriers and causes inter-carrier interference (ICI). In the case of insufficient cyclic prefix (CP), delay dispersion of the channel can also lead to ICI. Time variations of the channel over an OFDM symbol duration can be considered as another factor causing ICI.

The autocorrelator is used for frame detection and carrier frequency offset estimation. The CORDIC is used to estimate the frequency offset and to calculate the division in the channel estimation algorithm. A fast pipelined CORDIC architecture and autocorrelator is designed and implemented on FPGA. HDL and test bench is developed to simulate and verify the functionality of both the modules. The design is implemented on Spartan-2 100K, Spartan-3 100K and Virtex-2 2 Million gate capacity devices to check the performances of hardware implementation. It is found that as the technology changes from 130nm FPGA to 90nm FPGA the design speed increases from 100 MHz to 229 MHz for autocorrelator and 24 MHz to 55 MHz, at the same time the design consumes more power this is due to the fact that Virtex devices have more gate capacity and hence more power consumption. The sequential logic also reduces drastically. The design consumes almost equal number of macros on the entire implementation platform. The design is optimized for area and power requirements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","Field programmable gate arrays","OFDM","Wireless LAN","Frequency

of WCDMA. The PIN diode which is employed in the feedback loop of the VGA play as a variable resistor to realize the gain control function. By adjusting the bias of the diode, the gain of the VGA can be changed. An inductor is utilized in the feedback loop to reduce the noise figure of the circuit. After matching the circuit, we get a variable gain amplifier with 21 dB dynamic range, about 19 dB maximum gain, and 2.6 dB minimum noise figure. This work demonstrates a new method controlling the gain by adding a PIN diode in the feedback loop except changing the bias of the transistor.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2009.153","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076789/5076790/05076921.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2009.153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PIN Diode SiGe HBT Variable Gain Amplifier for WCDMA Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5076921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5076921/","displayDocTitle":"A PIN Diode SiGe HBT Variable Gain Amplifier for WCDMA Applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10720138","conferenceDate":"27-28 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PIN Diode SiGe HBT Variable Gain Amplifier for WCDMA Applications","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3522a593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044437S","chronDate":"27-28 Feb. 2009","isNumber":"5076790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076789","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5076921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5076935,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixiong Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Zhixiong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37674814600"},{"name":"Jinsha Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Jinsha","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37281354700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3522-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5076935","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Fading","Text categorization","Educational institutions","Mathematics","Computer science","Machine learning","Information retrieval","Application software","Text recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","cyclic codes","decoding","multiplexing","parity check codes","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi cyclic LDPC code","Rayleigh fading half-duplex channel","amplify-and-forward cooperative scheme","decode-and-forward scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative communication","Quasi-Cyclic LDPC codes","Rayleigh fading channels","Amplify and Forward","Decode and Forward"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative communication enables distributed terminals with a single antenna to form a virtual multiple antenna system and benefits from diversity.

The coding technique is called random diagonal ldquoRDrdquo code. One of the important properties of this code is that the cross correlation at data segment is always zero, which means that phase intensity induced noise (PIIN) is reduced. From the construction of RD code sequence, we can see that the RD code is constructed using code segment and data segment. Using this code property, RD code is implemented using coherent source (multilaser) and incoherent source (light emitting diode) for the code segment and data segment respectively. RD code using two multi-sources (inchoherent and coherent) can be considered as an effective way for maximizing the capacity while minimizing the cost of SAC-OCDMA. It is shown that the system using this new code matrices not only suppresses PIIN, but also allows a larger number of active users compared with other codes.","doi":"10.1109/ICIME.2009.156","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Management and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Management and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076977/5076978/05077133.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIME.2009.156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Code Structures Based on Coherent and Incoherent Sources for Spectral Amplitude Coding-OCDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5077133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5077133/","displayDocTitle":"New Code Structures Based on Coherent and Incoherent Sources for Spectral Amplitude Coding-OCDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10720410","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5077133/","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Code Structures Based on Coherent and Incoherent Sources for Spectral Amplitude Coding-OCDMA Systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3595a740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041204S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076977","isNumber":"5076978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076977","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5076978","articleId":"5077133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"}]
