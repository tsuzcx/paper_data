In this paper, we focus on UMTS access networks, since access devices are the main energy consumers in UMTS networks. We propose a novel approach for the energy-aware management of UMTS access networks, consisting in a dynamic network planning, that, based on the instantaneous traffic intensity, reduces the number of active access devices when they are underutilized (typically at night). When some access devices are switched off, radio coverage and service provisioning are taken care of by the devices that remain active, possibly with some small increase in the emitted power, so as to guarantee that service is available over the whole area, with the desired quality.","publicationTitle":"2009 21st International Teletraffic Congress","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 21st International Teletraffic Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290608/5300222/05300273.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300222","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient management of UMTS access networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5300273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient management of UMTS access networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5300273/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951146","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5300273/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient management of UMTS access networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1569188033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052236S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290608","isNumber":"5300222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290608","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5300222","articleId":"5300273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5300800,"authors":[{"name":"Tiezheng Cheng","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiezheng","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37669773900"},{"name":"Chaowei Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chaowei","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37289485100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5300800","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Data mining","Humans","Web pages","Educational institutions","Cities and towns","Computer science","Computational modeling","Testing","HTML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radio receivers","scheduling","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO broadcast systems","zero-forcing receiver","TDMA scheduling","maximum capacity criterion","closed-form expression","multiple-input multiple-output systems","time division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"In multi-user MIMO broadcast systems, utilize the simple zero-forcing receiver on top of the TDMA scheduling can obtain good performance.

How to differentiate their quality based on Qos criteria at Web service level is a challenging issue. Considering that evolutionary algorithm has powerful ability of searching information, a new Web service composition model under improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is presented in this paper. According to the non-functional attributes Qos of services, the model can select Web services with optimal Qos and compose them into value-added Web services. Furthermore, IPSO model not only can find the service with optimal QoS immediately but also can overcome the bottleneck of the standard PSO model. It can balance the exploitation and exploration and avoid premature convergence to some extent. As a result, web services can be invocated dynamically and be composed automatically and efficiently. The preliminary experimental results indicate that the Web service composition approach based on IPSO model is applicable and feasible to the optimization of general service compositions.","doi":"10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5300805","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Management and Service Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300802/5300803/05300805.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Management and Service Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5300805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Web Service Composition Approach Based on improved Particle Swarm Optimization Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Particle swarm optimization","Quality of service","Educational technology","Evolutionary computation","Computer vision","Web and internet services","Convergence","Software quality","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","quality of service","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web service composition approach","quality of services","Internet","improved particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5300805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Web Service Composition Approach Based on improved Particle Swarm Optimization Model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5300805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10953410","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Web Service Composition Approach Based on improved Particle Swarm Optimization Model","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"06-02-052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054922S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300802","isNumber":"5300803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300802","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300803","articleId":"5300805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5300821,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Hu","affiliation":["Sch. of Inf.

Channel state information (CSI) derived from channel estimation is necessary for receivers to accurately recover the transmitted signals. It is well known that the LMMSE (linear minimum mean square error) algorithm is one of the best linear receivers for OFDM channel estimation, which provides better mean squared error (MSE) performance but requires more computations than others. In this paper, a simplified LMMSE channel estimation algorithm using Fourier Transform technique and an appropriate training-sequences-aided is proposed without loss of MSE performance. Simulation results show that the proposed LMMSE algorithm can effectively lower computational complexity. When adopting 256 pilot symbols in OFDM systems with Rayleigh fading channels, the time spending in channel estimation reduces about a quarter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simplified LMMSE Channel Estimation Algorithm for OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Management and Service Science","doi":"10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5300821","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Management and Service Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300802/5300803/05300821.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5300821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5300821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5300821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Simplified LMMSE Channel Estimation Algorithm for OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5300821/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10953526","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simplified LMMSE Channel Estimation Algorithm for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"05-02-090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046668S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300802","isNumber":"5300803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300802","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300803","articleId":"5300821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5300838,"authors":[{"name":"Gaoming Huang","affiliation":["Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Gaoming","lastName":"Huang","id":"37289049400"},{"name":"Zhimao Bai","affiliation":["South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zhimao","lastName":"Bai","id":"37667287500"},{"name":"Jun Gao","affiliation":["Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37598668700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5300838","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Statistics","Source separation","Principal component analysis","Decorrelation","Signal processing","Signal analysis","Estimation","Computational modeling","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","decorrelation","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","second order statistics","decorrelation processing","principal component analysis","canonical correlation analysis","source signal estimation"]}],"abstract":"Overcomplete blind source separation (BSS) has been a difficult problem for a long time.

To estimate SCO, conventional methods rely on a known synchronization symbol or pilot symbols, which inevitably trim down the spectral efficiency of OFDM systems and are not available in non-cooperative communications. A novel blind estimation algorithm for SCO based on second order statistics of the received OFDM samples is devised in this paper, which can be used successfully for non-cooperative communications. Experiments indicate that better performance and lower complexity gain compared to existing blind schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05300868.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5300868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5300868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5300868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Sampling Clock Offset Estimation Algorithm for OFDM System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Clocks","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Statistics","Timing","AWGN","Performance gain","Frequency estimation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","higher order statistics","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","phase estimation","signal sampling","spectral analysis","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind sampling clock offset estimation algorithm","OFDM system","SCO estimation","phase rotation","intercarrier interference","ICI","BER","synchronization symbol","pilot symbol","spectral efficiency","noncooperative communication","second order statistics","complexity gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5300868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Blind Sampling Clock Offset Estimation Algorithm for OFDM System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5300868/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955515","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Sampling Clock Offset Estimation Algorithm for OFDM System","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034229S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5300868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5300870,"authors":[{"name":"Junwei Hao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junwei","lastName":"Hao","id":"37677079100"},{"name":"Yunxiao Zu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunxiao","lastName":"Zu","id":"37299824400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5300870","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Cognitive radio","Detectors","Signal processing","Signal detection","Random processes","AWGN","Power engineering and energy","Matched filters","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency allocation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy detection algorithm","cognitive radio","wireless technology","radio spectrum utilization","signal detection","licensed band allocation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5300870","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5300870","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","abstract":"As the rapid growth of wireless technologies, current spectrum scarcity has become a serious problem as more and more wireless applications compete for very little spectrum.

Most existing proposals of proactive channel access serve as the guidelines of switching channels according to the environmental changes. However, few of them takes account of the drastic cost of channel switching. The frequent channel switching raise up the packet-loss-ratio and aggravate the delay. On account of this, we propose an intelligence channel selection algorithm. In this algorithm, the secondary users decide whether to switch the channel or not based on channel prediction and switching overhead. Simulations show that the proposed method can reduce the number of channel switching by up to 20%, and minimize disruptions to primary users, especially when traffic load of primary user is heavy.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5301009","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05301009.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5301009","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Channel Switching in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Smart Channel Switching in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301009/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10956009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Channel Switching in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"02-31-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064176S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5301009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5301040,"authors":[{"name":"Rongrong Qian","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Rongrong","lastName":"Qian","id":"37399014800"},{"name":"Tao Peng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Peng","id":"37288452400"},{"name":"Yuan Qi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Qi","id":"37405517500"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301040","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301040","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO","Computational complexity","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","AWGN","Computational modeling","Virtual colonoscopy","Maximum likelihood decoding","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RSS ML MIMO detection scheme","imperfect channel","noise estimation","ZF equalization","posterior probability","maximum-likelihood detection","reduced search space"]}],"abstract":"RSS ML MIMO detection scheme which reduces the search space greatly comparing with the ideal ML detection but still achieves the near optimal performance is proposed.

In this paper, we employ distributed interactive multiple model (IMM) filter to estimate target position and velocity. A novel dynamic grouping idea is proposed and we apply it to dynamic-group scheduling scheme (DGSS), which is used to schedule next tasking node. Simulation results show that, compared with EKF, distributed IMM filter can achieve significant improvement on tracking accuracy for target tracking in WSN. At the same time, DGSS, which adopts changing sampling intervals and a dynamicgroup Scheduling idea, receives a superior performance in realtime property compared with the adaptive sensor scheduling strategy without energy consumption degraded.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5301056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5301056","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05301056.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed IMM Filter Based Dynamic-Group Scheduling Scheme for Maneuvering Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed IMM Filter Based Dynamic-Group Scheduling Scheme for Maneuvering Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Network","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301056/","accessionNumber":"10956143","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301056/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed IMM Filter Based Dynamic-Group Scheduling Scheme for Maneuvering Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"02-32-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054256S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5301056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5301057,"authors":[{"name":"S.

When on the general partial-band jamming condition, the channel can be considered as burst jamming channel. In traditional FH systems, the Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are commonly used to correct the burst errors. A better form of coding may be nonbinary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which have been shown to outperform binary LDPC codes and RS codes on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and magnetic recording channels. In this paper, we report on our investigation of nonbinary LDPC coded FH systems on partial-band jamming channels. We show that nonbinary LDPC coded FH systems outperform RS coded FH systems in both low speed FH systems and high FH systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301075.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonbinary LDPC Coded FH Systems over Partial-Band Jamming Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Jamming","Magnetic recording","Error correction codes","Sum product algorithm","Sparse matrices","Galois fields","AWGN channels","Bit error rate","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","frequency hop communication","jamming","parity check codes","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonbinary LDPC coded FH systems","partial-band jamming channels","frequency hopping communication systems","burst jamming channel","Reed-Solomon codes","nonbinary low-density parity-check codes","additive white Gaussian noise channels","AWGN channels","magnetic recording channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Nonbinary LDPC Coded FH Systems over Partial-Band Jamming Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301075/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10953111","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonbinary LDPC Coded FH Systems over Partial-Band Jamming Channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043154S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5301081,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-wu Zhang","affiliation":["Telecommunication Department, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Jian-wu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085630502"},{"name":"Qi Zhao","affiliation":["Telecommunication Department, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37654245900"},{"name":"Jing-yuan Zou","affiliation":["Telecommunication Department, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Jing-yuan","lastName":"Zou","id":"37653373400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301081","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":491},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Channel allocation","Interference constraints","Wireless sensor networks","Costs","Wireless communication","Information analysis","Spectral analysis","Game theory","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","graph colouring","parallel algorithms","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph-coloring spectrum allocation algorithm","cognitive radio","licensed spectrum","wireless environment","graph-coloring theory","channel allocation","parallel algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301081","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301081","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","abstract":"Cognitive radio can use the hole of licensed spectrum efficiently without interference to the primary users through sensing the wireless environment dynamically.

Correction Based on QPSO-BP Neural Network Algorithm","abstract":"Color information is very important for the applications of object recognition and image retrieval. However, the actual color varies by the illumination conditions. A supervised color correction based on hybrid algorithm combining Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) with Back Propagation (BP) neural network is proposed in this paper to reduce the effects of illumination conditions. Firstly, the Macbeth color checker containing 24 color patches is adopted. Then those color values of color patches under unknown illumination and standard illumination are recorded in order to obtain the learning samples. Finally, the transformation model is established by QPSO-BP neural network algorithm according to the learning samples. The experimental results show that the QPSO-BP algorithm is better than BP algorithm in convergence speed.

The harmonic nested array is composed of several uniformly-spaced linear subarrays, each of which processes an octave subband signal.

Each subarray beamforming is carried out with space-frequency signal processing approach, and four subarrays share the same weights among themselves. Based on this kind of processing architecture, the proposed beamformer splits the wideband signal into several nonuniform narrow subband ones which are processed in parallel, and only one subarray weights are needed. In this way, the proposed beamformer greatly alleviate burden of demanding too many weights for the arrays and hence contributes to significantly decreasing the computational load and improving the speed as well.

The SISO module could be equivalent to a linear module established by the values of the former exterior information of the component decoder. The value of No (n+1) exterior information could be predicted by the linear module. Compared to the traditional decoding algorithm, the computation quantity and computing time of the parallel prediction control algorithm (PPCA) will be smaller. Therefore, the complexity and delay of the decoding algorithm can be reduced by the new decoding scheme presented in this paper. The simulation results show that the error-rate performance of the new decoding structure based on PPCA is only lower by 0.1 dB than the traditional turbo decoding structure, but it can reduce a decoding iterative process of the component decoder.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Iterative decoding","Iterative algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Delay","Computational modeling","Communication system control","Concurrent computing","Throughput","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel prediction control","turbo code","decoding structure","SISO module"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301327","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301327.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding Structure of Turbo Code Based on Parallel Prediction Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decoding Structure of Turbo Code Based on Parallel Prediction Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301327/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301327/","accessionNumber":"10952860","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding Structure of Turbo Code Based on Parallel Prediction Control","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074716S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5301331,"authors":[{"name":"Der-Feng Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Der-Feng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37672412700"},{"name":"Shau-Ren Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shau-Ren","lastName":"Hung","id":"37673057900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5301331","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","Algorithm design and analysis","Finite impulse response filter","Signal sampling","Genetic algorithms","Digital signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency","Sampling methods","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","FIR filters","genetic algorithms","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistage multirate FIR filter","audio signal sampling rate conversion","genetic algorithm","optimum design","audio signal processing","input-output sampling rate","total storage requirement","multiplications per second","parameter combination approach","frequency 32 kHz","frequency 44.1 kHz","frequency 48 kHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301331","abstract":"In audio signal processing, there are three major sampling rates, 32 KHz, 44.1 KHz, and 48 KHz used in the audio signal processing.

However, spectrum sensing can cause negative effects such as decreasing secondary users' transmission time, and consuming their limited energy. This paper introduces a novel adaptive cooperative spectrum sensing scheme, which adaptively regulates the spectrum sensing periods according to channel usage characteristics and the number of secondary users in cooperative spectrum sensing. The proposed strategy aims at improving the available spectrum utilization and reducing sensing overhead in cognitive radio networks. The proposed spectrum sensing scheme is evaluated by the defined functions, i.e., the detection efficiency and the detection cost. Numerical results show that this method can achieve maximizing the detection efficiency and minimizing the detection cost rather than the conventional fixed period sensing method in cognitive radio networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5301455/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952029","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Scheme Based on Channel-Usage in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Scheme Based on Channel-Usage in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051739S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5301460,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangdong Jia","affiliation":["Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, China","Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiangdong","lastName":"Jia","id":"37400084400"},{"name":"Jing Yang","firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37087655451"},{"name":"Xiong Liu","firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087651989"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301460","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Power amplifiers","Interference","Constellation diagram","Voltage","Linearity","Character generation","Power generation","Signal generators","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel coding","code division multiple access","nonlinear codes","orthogonal codes","phase estimation","power amplifiers","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio links","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WCDMA uplink complex spreading modulation technology","3G standard","CDMA2000","multiple channel feature","3G mobile communication system","power amplifier nonlinearity","interference generation","I-path","Q-path","QAM","QPSK","complex scrambling","signal constellation","nonlinear orthogonal interference","mathematical analysis","phase pre-estimation","double complex scrambling scheme","phase pre-compensation","normal scrambling structure","mature estimation technology","reform scheme","orthogonal variable spreading factor code"]}],"abstract":"In 3G standards WCDMA and CDMA2000, the complex spreading modulation technology is employed. The feature of multiple channels enabled simultaneously is one of the main characteristics of 3G systems, which maybe result in a complicated constellation and very large scope of voltage which can influence the linearity of the power amplifier and generate interference between the signals of I-path and Q-path. Taking the uplink of early versions of WCDMA as an example, the constellation is studied firstly and a result of simulation given. The simulations show that the constellation of the combination signals is QAM, not QPSK, which is mapped by the combination signals of multiple channels in I-path and Q-path. What's more, the feature is enhanced by complex scrambling, which make the points from constellation rotated and the vectors lengthened. Besides this, based on the research of constellation, the nonlinear orthogonal interference in power amplifier is also researched with some mathematics analyses, which explain clearly the nonlinear orthogonal interference. In order to overcome the influence of nonlinearity of power amplifier, a reform scheme of complex scrambling with phase pre-estimation, called \"double complex scrambling scheme with phase pre-compensation\", is proposed. A phase pre-estimator and a normal scrambling structure are employed in this scheme. Because of the simple processing of normal scrambling and the mature estimation technology, the reform scheme is feasible, which can enhance the performance of complex spreading and modulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on the Characteristic of WCDMA Uplink Complex Spreading and Modulation","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301460","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301460.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Study on the Characteristic of WCDMA Uplink Complex Spreading and Modulation","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301460/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952116","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on the Characteristic of WCDMA Uplink Complex Spreading and Modulation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082713S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5301469,"authors":[{"name":"Gaoxiang Xing","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Gaoxiang","lastName":"Xing","id":"37590266000"},{"name":"Zhiming Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhiming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37591683400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5301469","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Signal processing algorithms","Array signal processing","Data engineering","Sensor arrays","Covariance matrix","Radar","Sonar","Interference","Transmission line matrix methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","adaptive signal processing","array signal processing","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct data domain least square algorithm","sidelobe level","mainlobe region","uniformly linear array","adaptive array signal processing","disturbing errors"]}],"abstract":"We present a modified direct data domain least square (D3LS) algorithm here to decrease the sidelobe level of a beampattern when the D3LS is used in non-stationary noisy circumstance .

In this paper, we consider an underlay cognitive radio system in which the secondary users can make use of the allowance of the primary users' SINR constraints and operate on the same spectrum band as the primary signals. The dynamic spectrum occupation process of this underlay cognitive radio system is modeled by continuous-time Markov chains. Moreover, appropriate access probabilities for the secondary users are adopted to decrease the mutual interference and coordinate the spectrum access among the secondary users. Under three kinds of optimization criteria, the performance of the underlay cognitive radio system is analyzed. The simulation results show that the access opportunities of the secondary users in the underlay cognitive radio system, compared with the overlay system, can be enhanced considerably, and thus the overall throughput of the secondary users can be improved greatly. Also, the proportional fairness criterion used in this system can not only provide more fair spectrum sharing among secondary users than the maximal-throughput criterion, but also achieve much higher throughput than the max-min criterion.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301482.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access in Underlay Cognitive Radio System with SINR Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5301482/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access in Underlay Cognitive Radio System with SINR Constraints","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952207","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Access in Underlay Cognitive Radio System with SINR Constraints","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054661S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5301485,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Xu","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37670345500"},{"name":"Xiaoming Liu","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292948700"},{"name":"Na Ji","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Ji","id":"37089140091"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5301485","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1410},"abstract":"The images degraded by fog suffer from poor contrast.

Watermarking messages combined a Gaussian-noise template were embedded to vertical high frequency coefficients which were produced by one-level integer wavelet transform of the host image. Then the same messages were embedded to each sub-image by quantization repeatedly. Two watermarking images were extracted by correlation calculation and majority rule.

For short length LDPC, there exist cycles in the bipartite graph, thereby leading to the high correlation among the extrinsic information of bits out from BP decoder. Based on the Gaussian assumption of the extrinsic log-likelihood ratios (LLRs)delivered by BP decoder, we multiply the extrinsic output of the decoder by a scaling factor and then pass it as a priori information to the demodulator for the next iteration. In this way, we can decrease the correlation of coded bits within the symbol and thus reduce the error propagation.

Furthermore, the average efficiency calculated according to the power added efficiency and the probability density of the one-carrier TD-SCDMA signal has been improved nearly 5%, from 20% to 25%.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301553","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301553.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Efficiency RF Power Amplifiers with Dynamic Biases for TD-SCDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301553/","displayDocTitle":"High Efficiency RF Power Amplifiers with Dynamic Biases for TD-SCDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952446","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301553/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Efficiency RF Power Amplifiers with Dynamic Biases for TD-SCDMA Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-04-011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048011S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5301558,"authors":[{"name":"Yuqing Lin","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Lab. of Wireless Commun., Nanjing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuqing","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085916308"},{"name":"Qi Zhu","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Lab. of Wireless Commun., Nanjing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37535153600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301558","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel allocation","Cognitive radio","Laboratories","Resource management","Throughput","Wireless communication","Protection","Interference constraints","Mobile communication","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","nonlinear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","channel allocation","fair sharing","cognitive radio system","resource allocation","spectrum sharing","nonlinear programming","signal-to-interference ratio","SIR constraint","poverty line"]}],"abstract":"In the cognitive networks, one of the major concerns is the fact that cognitive users may cause harmful interference to licensed users. And the fairness of resource allocation is another important problem in this network. This paper focuses on a joint channel and power allocation algorithm that can both protect licensed users and guarantee the fairness of spectrum sharing among cognitive users. This resource assigning problem can be formulated as a nonlinear programming. In this paper, an extended version of joint channel and power allocation algorithm is proposed. We consider the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) constraint at the cognitive users who share the same channel, and introduce the fairness utility based on the definition of poverty line (PL), which is the minimum number of available channels for each user. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm makes good performances in both fairness utility and network capacity.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301558","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301558.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301558","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power and Channel Allocation Based on Fair Sharing in Cognitive Radio System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power and Channel Allocation Based on Fair Sharing in Cognitive Radio System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301558/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301558/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952529","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Power and Channel Allocation Based on Fair Sharing in Cognitive Radio System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070159S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5301593,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzeng Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Special Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks Ministry of Education, School of communication and information engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuzeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37292394500"},{"name":"Jianjun Xing","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Special Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks Ministry of Education, School of communication and information engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Xing","id":"37529219200"},{"name":"Qiaohe Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Special Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks Ministry of Education, School of communication and information engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qiaohe","lastName":"Yang","id":"37533322100"},{"name":"Huichang Shi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Special Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks Ministry of Education, School of communication and information engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Huichang","lastName":"Shi","id":"37537777900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301593","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301593","abstract":"The location technology in wireless sensor network (WSN) is always the focus of research scholars at home and abroad.

The simulations show diversity gains of at least 8 dB when cooperative communication has been implemented with IDMA over DF and AF protocols. We also provide an insight to how power allocation between sources and relays would affect the performance. It reveals that relay nodes can be adaptive to select DF or AF protocol based on the constraints of power allocation and the locations of relays.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Diversity methods","Multiuser detection","Interference cancellation","Diversity reception","Wireless networks","Multiple access interference","Decoding","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","diversity reception","interleaved codes","multi-access systems","protocols","radiofrequency interference","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","diversity gain","multiple source-destination pair","multiple common relay","interference problem","interleave-division multiple-access","decode-and-forward protocol","amplify-and-forward protocol","power allocation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301708","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301708.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Communication Based on IDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Communication Based on IDMA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301708/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301708/","accessionNumber":"10953119","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Communication Based on IDMA","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043319S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5301709,"authors":[{"name":"Wenfang Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenfang","lastName":"Xia","id":"37625052800"},{"name":"Shu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280444700"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279763400"},{"name":"Wenqing Chen","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Wenqing","lastName":"Chen"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301709","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":546},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Cognitive radio","Energy consumption","Chromium","Reliability engineering","Power engineering and energy","Energy measurement","Protection","Communication system traffic control","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","pattern clustering","radio spectrum management","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cluster-based energy efficient cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radios","overhead traffic","battery-operated mobile terminals","control signaling","data fusion method","cluster decisions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301709","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301709","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is a crucial measure for cognitive radio networks (CRN) to protect transmission of primary users. Cooperative spectrum sensing is regarded as the most promising method to improve the reliability of spectrum sensing. However, such cooperation also introduces overhead traffic of control signaling and result transmission which consumes more power in battery-operated mobile terminals. In this paper, an energy efficient transmission scheme is proposed. Clustering technique is adopted to save energy consumed in reporting results and exchanging information. All cognitive nodes are separated into a few clusters, and report local decisions to cluster heads to make cluster decisions through some data fusion method. Cluster decisions are forwarded to the common receiver to decide whether the spectrum of interest is idle or not. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method shows significant energy saving from 35% to 95% compared with the conventional scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301709.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-Based Energy Efficient Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5301709/","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-Based Energy Efficient Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10953120","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-Based Energy Efficient Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137977S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-02"},{"_id":5301734,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixiong Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Zhixiong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37674814600"},{"name":"Jinsha Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Jinsha","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37281354700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301734","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Maximum likelihood estimation","Equations","Code standards","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Power engineering and energy","Power engineering computing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood estimation","parity check codes","probability","pseudonoise codes","synchronisation","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code-aided soft frame synchronization algorithm","quasicyclic LDPC coded system","maximum-likelihood rule","probability","parity-check matrix","soft information vector","PN sequence","synchronization search process"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Code-Aided Soft Frame Synchronization Algorithm for Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Coded System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301734","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301734","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301734.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","abstract":"A LDPC code-aided frame synchronization algorithm based on maximum-likelihood rule is proposed.

There have been tremendous demands for high speed data transmission in underwater acoustic communications. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been introduced to high speed acoustic communications. Accurate channel equalizer is necessary for OFDM coherent detection of the underwater acoustic signals. We propose an approach using pilot training sequence to obtain the channel phase rotation in sent constellation by LS algorithm that initializes the channel information, then the frequency domain LMS adaptive equalizer is imposed to every subcarrier of the received training frequency domain OFDM symbol to obtain the information of impulse response. Frequency domain equalization is computationally efficient both in simulation and pool trial. Then the channel information is employed to equalize other OFDM symbols. Thus, this approach is very attractive for high speed implementation of an underwater acoustic OFDM receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications,

So it's necessary to develop an equalization algorithm to minimize the computational complexity and improve the convergence rate. This paper presents a new adaptive reduced-rank linear equalization algorithm, called rectangle unitary multistage Wiener filter reduced-rank equalization (RUMSWFRE). In the equalization process, the rectangle blocking matrix is utilized by multistage Wiener filter and implemented by the correlation subtraction algorithm. The new scheme uses a rectangle blocking matrix, which is chosen from the square blocking matrix of unitary multistage Wiener filter (UMSWF). And it can reduce the size of observation data vectors step by step in the forward recursion decomposition of UMSWF. In this way, the computational complexity is reduced and the convergence rate becomes faster. Performance analysis and simulation results show that this proposed method yields similar error performance with much lower computational complexity and faster convergence rate compared with the traditional ones.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301765.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Rank Equalization of Unitary Multistage Wiener Filter Based on Rectangle Blocking Matrix for Multiple Input Multiple Output","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wiener filter","MIMO","Computational complexity","Iterative algorithms","Convergence","Adaptive equalizers","Matrix decomposition","Computational modeling","Intersymbol interference","Nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","equalisers","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","vectors","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO","multiple input multiple output system","rectangle blocking matrix","RUMSWFRE","rectangle unitary multistage Wiener filter reduced-rank equalization","computational complexity","convergence rate","correlation subtraction algorithm","square blocking matrix","observation data vector","forward recursion decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Rank Equalization of Unitary Multistage Wiener Filter Based on Rectangle Blocking Matrix for Multiple Input Multiple Output","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301765/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951943","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Rank Equalization of Unitary Multistage Wiener Filter Based on Rectangle Blocking Matrix for Multiple Input Multiple Output","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05295S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5301783,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Cai","firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085920268"},{"name":"Qi Zhu","firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37535153600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301783","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Laboratories","Wireless communication","Mobile communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Frequency","Analytical models","Radio network","Radio spectrum management","Interchannel interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","probability","radio spectrum management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guard channel policy","cognitive radio system","wireless communication","wireless spectrum allocation algorithm","time-space varying characteristics","Huang Zhen","blocking probability","channel utilization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Guard Channel Algorithm in Cognitive Radio System","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301783.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301783","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301783","abstract":"Cognitive radio technology has arisen as a hot topic in wireless communication in recent years.

According to these two packet level policies, the queue is separated into two parts, delay queue and discard queue. The paper mainly analyzes the performance of a CRN with such a two-part call level queue. Here, a Markov model is proposed to derive the formulas for packet loss ratio, packet delay, spectrum utilization and throughput. Numerical results show that theoretical models are consistent with simulation results. The major observations are summarized below, (i) Both packet loss ratio and throughput increase while the packet delay decreases with the increase of the delay queue length, (ii) Adopting different delay queue length does not cause much difference in CRN's spectrum utilization, but has a large effect on throughput. (iii) The performance is bounded when the arrival rate goes into infinitely high.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301789.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of the Cognitive Radio Network with a Call Level Queue for Secondary Users","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5301789/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of the Cognitive Radio Network with a Call Level Queue for Secondary Users","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952035","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of the Cognitive Radio Network with a Call Level Queue for Secondary Users","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"05-03-025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108809S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5301808,"authors":[{"name":"Hongxing Xia","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hongxing","lastName":"Xia","id":"37599360600"},{"name":"Guoping Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guoping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37599210300"},{"name":"Yaoming Ding","affiliation":["Xiaogan University, Xiaogan, China"],"firstName":"Yaoming","lastName":"Ding","id":"37069581700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301808","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Cognitive radio","Detectors","Matched filters","Detection algorithms","Noise shaping","Physics","Signal to noise ratio","Filtering","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral entropy","primary user detection","cognitive radio","spectral complexity","noise energy level"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301808","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301808","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","abstract":"Primary user detection is the key enabling technology in cognitive radio.

In this paper, we present a method of face recognition based on projection map and Fourier Transform to solve the one training sample problem. To acquire more information from the single training sample, each original training image is linearly combined with its projection map into a new training image. By using Fourier transform, the Fourier spectrum of face image is obtained that is invariant against spatial translation. The LI distance classifier is adopted in recognition. The proposed algorithm obtains acceptable experimental results on the ORL face database.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5301835","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05301835.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5301835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Based on Projection Map and Fourier Transform for One Training Image Per Person","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301835/","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Based on Projection Map and Fourier Transform for One Training Image Per Person","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955459","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301835/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Based on Projection Map and Fourier Transform for One Training Image Per Person","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-17-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047073S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5301835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5301849,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Cai","firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Cai","id":"37405311700"},{"name":"Xiao-hui Zhao","firstName":"Xiao-hui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37293145500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301849","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"abstract":"The current channel estimation algorithm is often performed under the assumption that the additive channel noise is white and Gaussian, but there is experimental evidence to show that the additive channel noise is non-Gaussian and non-linear in a wireless environment.

The relay station adopts the amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying strategy and is allowed to couple an input subcarrier to another output subcarrier. We show that in a source-relay-destination model, subcarrier coupling can achieve substantial capacity gain only when the two hop links have similar channel qualities, and the achievable gain also depends on the slow-fading magnitude of either hop. In view of this, we employ a sub-optimal subcarrier coupling scheme with low complexity for the multi-user scenario. Simulation results demonstrate that the sub-optimal scheme achieve similar performance compared to the conventionally optimal scheme.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301858","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301858.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier Coupling and Scheduling for Multi-User OFDMA Relaying Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier Coupling and Scheduling for Multi-User OFDMA Relaying Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301858/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952365","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5301858/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier Coupling and Scheduling for Multi-User OFDMA Relaying Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046549S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5301879,"authors":[{"name":"Fuping Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Fuping","lastName":"Hu","id":"37403590200"},{"name":"Shu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280444700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301879","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":490},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301879","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Fading","Wireless sensor networks","Chromium","Frequency","Quantization","Face detection","Detectors","Sensor systems","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fading channels","probability","quantisation (signal)","signal detection","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","cognitive radio","cooperative energy detection technique","probability","fading channel","spectrum sensing","quantization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301879","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301879.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Detection for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Sensor Network over Fading Channels","abstract":"With the exciting progress of wireless sensor networks (WSN), a major difficulty will be faced in that the limited frequency spectrum, even with the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands, will be extremely crowded. Moreover purchasing spectrum rights with millions or billions of dollars is unreasonable under an emphasis on low-cost to WSN. Thus an alternate method based on the concept of cognitive radio is explored to capture spectrum for WSN. A cooperative energy detection technique is introduced. The probabilities of detection of proposed technique are evaluated over some classical fading channels. The quantization case is also considered for practicality. The simulation results show that the quantization case exhibits almost comparable performance with the optimum Neyman-Pearson detector, while it has much less overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301879/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10952448","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301879/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy Detection for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Sensor Network over Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Detection for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Sensor Network over Fading Channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065427S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5301896,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Hu","affiliation":["Logistics department of information, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37291276000"},{"name":"Er-tian Hua","affiliation":["Information College, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Er-tian","lastName":"Hua","id":"37540392200"},{"name":"Yu-lian Fei","affiliation":["Information College, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yu-lian","lastName":"Fei","id":"37537097600"},{"name":"Da-qiang Chen","affiliation":["Information College, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Da-qiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37400198200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4638-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4639-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5301896","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks","Supply chains","Data mining","Clustering algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Partitioning algorithms","Quality management","Educational institutions","Accidents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","fuzzy neural nets","supply chain management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","fuzzy clustering","supply chain quality","elements data mining"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301896","abstract":"The research of influencing elements is a basic work in supply chain quality management.

This paper presents a methodology for assessing the impact of bursty frame errors on voice quality as measured by MOS (mean opinion score) using waveform level simulations. The approach presented consists of simulating the frame error sequence and mapping the frame error sequence to a sequence of instantaneous MOS values using the ITU E-Model and a recency model. The proposed methodology is applied to estimate the QoS for voice traffic over a wide variety of WCDMA radio channels. Both average MOS scores and link availability (defined as the fraction of time the MOS is greater than an acceptance threshold) are estimated. It is shown that there exits a simple relationship between the average frame error rate (which is a parameter for the physical layer design) and the average MOS and link availability for voice traffic over a broad range of radio channels with multipath fading.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation-Based Estimate of QoS for Voice Traffic over WCDMA Radio Links","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301913","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301913.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simulation-Based Estimate of QoS for Voice Traffic over WCDMA Radio Links","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301913/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952542","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation-Based Estimate of QoS for Voice Traffic over WCDMA Radio Links","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"05-03-016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071713S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5301939,"authors":[{"name":"Fangfang Liu","affiliation":["Next Generation Communication System Theory and Technology Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fangfang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37672639400"},{"name":"Chunyan Feng","affiliation":["Next Generation Communication System Theory and Technology Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunyan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289215100"},{"name":"Caili Guo","affiliation":["Next Generation Communication System Theory and Technology Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Caili","lastName":"Guo","id":"37287906300"},{"name":"Yue Wang","affiliation":["Next Generation Communication System Theory and Technology Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311537700"},{"name":"Dong Wei","affiliation":["Next Generation Communication System Theory and Technology Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wei","id":"37667190900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301939","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Cognitive radio","Space technology","Frequency","Interference","Receiving antennas","Communication systems","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","RF signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization spectrum sensing scheme","cognitive radios","secondary users","primary users","space domain","time domain","signal to interference noise ratio","wireless communication networks","virtual polarization adaptation"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radios are proposed for secondary users (SU) recovering spectrum holes unused by primary users (PU) in time and space domain.

Performance analysis and simulation results show that this scheme achieves high throughput and gets unbounded capacity growth when increasing the number of active users or in high SNR regime.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301948.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Adaptive Transmitting Mode Selection for Wireless MIMO Broadcast Channels with Limited Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Feedback","Interference","Control systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Design optimization","Base stations","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","MIMO communication","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive transmitting mode selection","wireless MIMO broadcast channels","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system","per user unitary and rate control","channel information","base station","multiuser mode transmission","single-user mode transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Adaptive Transmitting Mode Selection for Wireless MIMO Broadcast Channels with Limited Feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301948/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952709","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Adaptive Transmitting Mode Selection for Wireless MIMO Broadcast Channels with Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080391S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5301949,"authors":[{"name":"Yougan Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology of the Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, P.R.C"],"firstName":"Yougan","lastName":"Chen","id":"38468272900"},{"name":"Xiaomei Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology of the Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, P.R.C"],"firstName":"Xiaomei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37832289300"},{"name":"Lan Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology of the Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, P.R.C"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38468176500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5301949","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of LDPC Codes over Shallow Water Acoustic Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Parity check codes","Fading","Bit error rate","Iterative decoding","Degradation","Interference","Acoustic reflection","Channel coding","Additive noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error statistics","iterative decoding","multipath channels","parity check codes","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC codes","shallow water acoustic communication","multipath signal","channel coding","time-varying fading channel","probability density function","belief propagation","initial decoding messages","low-density parity-check codes","bit error rate","iterative decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301949","abstract":"The major obstacle to shallow water acoustic communication is the interference of multipath signal results from surface and bottom reflections.

A power roll-roff strategy exploiting the clustering feature of WLAN MIMO channel is used to get the number of significant taps, which largely improves the performance of common time TD Kalman algorithm.

A performance comparison is given with different user numbers and these results show that UDPA has a small reduction in cell average throughput lost but a large gain on cell-edge user throughput.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301995","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05301995.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Multi-Cell Non-Cooperative Power Allocation Game Algorithm for OFDMA Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5301995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5301995/","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Multi-Cell Non-Cooperative Power Allocation Game Algorithm for OFDMA Cellular Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952881","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5301995/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Multi-Cell Non-Cooperative Power Allocation Game Algorithm for OFDMA Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058162S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5301995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5302003,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronics Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280460800"},{"name":"Zhiyun Du","affiliation":["College of Electronics Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyun","lastName":"Du","id":"37672532700"},{"name":"Yong Zeng","affiliation":["College of Electronics Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37668649200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302003","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Discrete wavelet transforms","Pipeline processing","Filters","Signal processing algorithms","Hardware","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet transforms","Convolution","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","image coding","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","lifting-based discrete wavelet transform","convolution-based approach","9/7 lifting DWT algorithm","multistage pipeline structure","hardware architecture","image coding"]}],"abstract":"A new approach for Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been proposed recently under the name of lifting scheme.

The algorithm is proposed for MIMO-OFDM systems and can detect both channel frequency responses and number of multi-path taps.

The performance of the proposed approach is compared to the popular minimum description length (MDL) algorithm for estimation of the number of channel paths, by means of simulation in the context of a 2times2 MIMO-OFDM transceiver system.

RFF Technology application scheme in CR is suggested, realizing in transceiver of Secondary User (SU). Two steps are introduced for improving capability of detection: First, based on distribution network, cooperative RFF detection is realized among the SU; second, sensing frequency band is shortened and Base Station only deals with Primary User (PU) in the range of local cell.

One of them is how to determine a feasible path that satisfies a set of constraints. Multi-constrained QoS routing finds a feasible route in the network that satisfies multiple independent constraints. In general, multi-constrained path selection is a NP-complete problem that cannot be exactly solved in polynomial time. The existing routing algorithms usually optimize a single objective, which have some inherent drawbacks. An improved genetic algorithm based on multi-objective optimization algorithm for multiple QoS routing constraints is proposed in this paper, which search for the set of Pareto optimal solutions of QoS routing.

Active interference cancellation (AIC) is a novel OOB leakage suppressing technique. In this paper, AIC method for multiple narrow-band primary signals (NPSs) in cognitive OFDM is discussed. We propose a sub-optimal method of multiple NPSs AIC, which takes different NPSs' frequency locations and bandwidths into account. Besides, we provide a matrix elements pre-nullifying method to drop computational complexity of the sub-optimal method. Simulation results show that the NPSs' frequency locations have no significant impact on performance of multiple NPSs AIC method, while the performance is worse with increase of the NPSs' bandwidths. The low complexity multiple NPSs AIC method reduces complexity greatly, only with slight performance degradation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Interference Cancellation for Multiple Narrow-Band Primary Signals in Cognitive OFDM","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302043","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302043.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Active Interference Cancellation for Multiple Narrow-Band Primary Signals in Cognitive OFDM","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302043/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10953125","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Interference Cancellation for Multiple Narrow-Band Primary Signals in Cognitive OFDM","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101631S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5302058,"authors":[{"name":"Lijun Ge","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Ge","id":"37405619800"},{"name":"Yingxin Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yingxin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37403488200"},{"name":"Yu'ang Jin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yu'ang","lastName":"Jin","id":"37534838600"},{"name":"Wenqi Li","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Wenqi","lastName":"Li","id":"37404625400"},{"name":"Hong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Information Technical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37405486700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302058","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Frequency estimation","Amplitude modulation","Frequency modulation","Modulation coding","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Frequency division multiplexing","Phase estimation","Phase locked loops","Tracking loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","OFDM modulation","phase locked loops","quadrature amplitude modulation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier frequency offset tracking scheme","MQAM-OFDM systems","multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","peak-to-average power ratio","phase cancellation","likelihood function","multicarrier phase locked loop","frequency domain","time domain"]}],"abstract":"A novel carrier frequency offset tracking scheme for multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MQAM-OFDM) systems is proposed using a designed conjugate code composed of MQAM mapping values and their complex conjugates which can also reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

Similar types of degradation can occur when the signal array response is known exactly, but the training sample size is small. In this paper, based on explicit modeling of uncertainties in the desired signal array response and data covariance matrix, we propose robust adaptive beamforming algorithm for implementing a quadratic inequality constraint. We show that the proposed algorithm belongs to the class of diagonal loading approaches, but diagonal loading terms can be precisely calculated based on the given level of uncertainties in the signal array response and data covariance matrix. Our proposed robust algorithm improves the overall robustness against the signal steering vector mismatches and small training sample size, enhances the array system performance under random perturbations in sensor parameters and makes the mean output array SINR consistently close to the optimal one. Computer simulation results demonstrate excellent performance of our proposed algorithm as compared with the existing adaptive beamforming algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302074","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302074.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302074","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming under the Quadratic Inequality Constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming under the Quadratic Inequality Constraint","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302074/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302074/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951877","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming under the Quadratic Inequality Constraint","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-02-073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044744S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5302084,"authors":[{"name":"Shiquan Xu","firstName":"Shiquan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37667422400"},{"name":"Qinyu Zhang","firstName":"Qinyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289942300"},{"name":"Wei Lin","firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37596687400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302084","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit rate","Cognitive radio","Interference","Chromium","Resource management","Downlink","Signal to noise ratio","Algorithm design and analysis","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency division multiplexing","multi-access systems","particle swarm optimisation","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power","bit allocation","multiuser cognitive radio system","radio channel","spectrum utilization","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","particle swarm optimization","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"The cognitive radio (CR) can take full advantage of the spectrum by enabling second user (SU) to access idle radio channel licensed by primary user (PU) to improve spectrum utilization.

And in this paper we analyze the theoretical system capacity with available sub-channels, subject to interference tolerance and power ceiling appointed by PU in a downlink OFDM-Based CR multiuser scenario, and employ a particle swarm optimization-based (PSO) algorithm to achieve the resource allocation.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302084","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302084.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSO-Based OFDM Adaptive Power and Bit Allocation for Multiuser Cognitive Radio System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PSO-Based OFDM Adaptive Power and Bit Allocation for Multiuser Cognitive Radio System","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302084/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951951","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5302084/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSO-Based OFDM Adaptive Power and Bit Allocation for Multiuser Cognitive Radio System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0549S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5302139,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Da","firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Da","id":"37533679000"},{"name":"Yanling Wang","firstName":"Yanling","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088166811"},{"name":"Tiecheng Xie","firstName":"Tiecheng","lastName":"Xie","id":"37088167181"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302139","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"abstract":"This paper presents the application of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes in Ka band.

On the other hand, base station cooperative processing is explored to address the inter-cell interference mitigation problem in the cellular system. But most of the analytical work is based on the single-user scenario. This paper provides a generalized information theoretic analysis to illuminate the downlink performance limits of DAS in the multi-user cellular system with antenna module cooperative processing. A comparison of several transmit schemes is given: scheduling the best user, scheduling multiple users simultaneously and scheduling multiple best users. It is demonstrated that with simple linear processing at the transmitters scheduling multiple users simultaneously achieves a tremendous system capacity increase over scheduling the best user. This is because antenna module cooperative processing can mitigate the inter-user interference effectively and the spatial degrees of freedom are fully exploited. Furthermore, when the number of users is much larger than the number of remote antenna modules, scheduling multiple best users can attain the multi-user diversity gain which leads to an increase of the sum capacity. These analytical results are verified by Monte Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Performance and Capacity of Distributed Antenna System in Multi-User Scenario","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302164","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302164.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Performance and Capacity of Distributed Antenna System in Multi-User Scenario","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302164/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952306","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Performance and Capacity of Distributed Antenna System in Multi-User Scenario","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052876S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5302169,"authors":[{"name":"Shubin Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information Engineering, Inner Mongolia University for the Nationalities, Hohhot, China","Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","UWB Wireless Communications Research Center, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Shubin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37656659700"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information Engineering, Inner Mongolia University for the Nationalities, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"Kyungsup Kwak","affiliation":["UWB Wireless Communications Research Center, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungsup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302169","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Power system modeling","Temperature dependence","Cognitive radio","Ultra wideband technology","Wireless communication","Communications technology","Frequency","Temperature control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radiofrequency interference","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emission power control strategy","cognitive radio-ultra wideband communication system","interference temperature detection model","CR-UWB system","next-generation short-range wireless communication technology","idle frequency band","radio environment","three-dimensional space construction","licensed user"]}],"abstract":"The cognitive radio combining ultra wideband (CRUWB) system will be considered as one of the candidates of the next generation short range wireless communication technology.

The results show that this algorithm performs better than Equal Bit Different Power scheme but a little worse than other optimal algorithms, thus enhancing the spectrum utilization and system capacity.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302170","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302170.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Resource Allocation Algorithm for Single-User OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302170/","displayDocTitle":"A New Resource Allocation Algorithm for Single-User OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952310","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302170/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Resource Allocation Algorithm for Single-User OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047163S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5302183,"authors":[{"name":"Yanwei Fu","affiliation":["Network Center, Jiangsu Polytechnic University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanwei","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085911789"},{"name":"Yingying Zhu","affiliation":["Information Science and Engineering Institute, Jiangsu Polytechnic University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yingying","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085912852"},{"name":"Haiyang Yu","affiliation":["Information Science and Engineering Institute, Jiangsu Polytechnic University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haiyang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085914229"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302183","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intrusion detection","Biological neural networks","Multilayer perceptrons","Principal component analysis","Artificial neural networks","Artificial intelligence","Information security","Resonance","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resonance theory","backpropagation","multilayer perceptrons","principal component analysis","radial basis function networks","security of data","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection system","network attack problem","network security","neural network method","multilayer perceptron","radial basis function","self-organizing feature map","adaptive resonance theory","principal component analysis","backpropagation network"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Neural Network Technologies in Intrusion Detection Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302183","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302183","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302183.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","abstract":"In recent years, the network attack become more and more widespread and difficult in against.

According to the characteristics of users' packet queues as well as CSI, the proposed algorithm adaptively allocates wireless resource to users to exploit as much spatial and multiuser diversity as possible.

However, the high average computational time complexity of rotation phase coefficient searching in PTS algorithm makes it difficult to implement. For reducing the average computational time complexity of PTS algorithm with negligible performance penalty, we proposed a dynamic discrete particle swarm optimization based phase coefficient searching (DDPSO-PCS) algorithm for PTS. DDPSO-PCS algorithm seeks the optimum phase coefficients in PTS with particle swarm optimization algorithm. The number of particles will be adjusted during iterations to reduce the average computational time complexity. The DDPSO-PCS algorithm can reduce 50% to 90% average computational time complexity comparing with traditional PTS phase coefficient searching algorithm.

The exponential iteration has been taken in this algorithm, whose convergence speed is much faster than traditional arithmetic iterations. Moreover, in order to improve its robustness, the previous power in iterations has been added in current power iterative equation as a weighted feedback.

We find that previous studies using pilots to track the channel time variations always regard the ICI on pilots as additive white noise, which actually increases the estimation errors. As an enhancement of our previous studies on uneven pilot-assisted time-varying (TV) channel estimation (CE) for practical OFDM systems, to further improve the estimation precision, this paper employs the correlative coding to compress the ICI from data to pilots. Simulation results show that by using such a simple coding method, the ICI coefficient is reduced greatly and the estimation Mean Square Error (MSE) dropped by 3 dB. It is proved that the correlative code based TV CE method is feasible for practical mobile OFDM systems with good performance and bandwidth efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302433","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302433.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlative Coding Based Channel Estimation for Practical OFDM Systems over Time Varying Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302433/","displayDocTitle":"Correlative Coding Based Channel Estimation for Practical OFDM Systems over Time Varying Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952054","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302433/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlative Coding Based Channel Estimation for Practical OFDM Systems over Time Varying Channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-02-092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077918S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5302440,"authors":[{"name":"Suqin He","affiliation":["Beijing University of Chemical and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Suqin","lastName":"He","id":"37676527600"},{"name":"Puming Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Chemical and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Puming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37670471400"},{"name":"Jinyu Yan","affiliation":["Beijing University of Chemical and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jinyu","lastName":"Yan","id":"37678296500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5302440","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"abstract":"In this paper, a new simple and effective frame interpolation algorithm is proposed which could be used in rate control in real-time low-bit-rate video application.

In order to improve the performance of the underwater acoustic OFDM communication system, the irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) code as a channel coding scheme is proposed in this paper. We analyzed the effect of parameters of the IRA code on the performance of the system. Computer simulation has been implemented and the sea trial has been carried out in shallow water acoustic channels near Xiamen port. The simulation results show that the IRA coding scheme has improved the SNR (signal noise ratio) performance of the system at range of 14 dB to 16 dB compared with the system without coding and the BER performance of the IRA code will get improvement with the increase of the code length and the iteration of decoding to a certain degree, and then tends to stable. Field test experiment results obtained with the IRA code are provided, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed channel coding for underwater acoustic OFDM communication system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302465.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of IRA Codes for Underwater Acoustic OFDM Communication System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Underwater acoustics","Channel coding","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM modulation","Underwater communication","Computer simulation","Computational modeling","Acoustic noise","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error statistics","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic OFDM communication system","IRA code analysis","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multicarrier modulation","channel time-variability","channel coding scheme","irregular repeat accumulate code","computer simulation","shallow water acoustic channels","signal noise ratio performance","BER performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of IRA Codes for Underwater Acoustic OFDM Communication System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302465/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952230","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of IRA Codes for Underwater Acoustic OFDM Communication System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045432S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5302484,"authors":[{"name":"Guimei Li","firstName":"Guimei","lastName":"Li","id":"37538008200"},{"name":"Yuanjian Zhou","firstName":"Yuanjian","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37874914100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302484","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multiuser detection","Interference constraints","Signal to noise ratio","Interference suppression","Multiple access interference","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","multiuser detection","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA blind multiuser detection","multiaccess interferences suppression","direct sequence code division multiple access system","linear momentum linearly constrained CMA","constant modulus algorithm","signal to interference plus noise ratio","BPSK modulation"]}],"abstract":"A widely linear momentum linearly constrained constant modulus algorithm for the multi-access interferences (MAI) suppression in direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems is proposed and analyzed in this paper.

The current researches on cognitive radio (CR) technologies and secondary usage of the spectrum have received a lot of attention. However, in CR networks, secondary users (SUs) should spend a large number of times for spectrum sensing. In this paper, we propose a exponential moving average (EMA) based energy prediction method to enhance the energy detection for spectrum sensing. In our algorithm, the energy prediction can predict the energy level in the frequency bands. Based on these predicted information, SUs can skip the sensing duty when the predicted energy level is larger than the preset threshold (the existence of primary user(PU)). The simulation results indicate that our method can reduce the whole sensing time of SUs effectively, as compared with the traditional energy detection method.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302514","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302514.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302514","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Energy Prediction Based Spectrum Sensing Approach for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Energy Prediction Based Spectrum Sensing Approach for Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302514/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302514/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952396","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Energy Prediction Based Spectrum Sensing Approach for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052246S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5302520,"authors":[{"name":"Yongpeng Wu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yongpeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37600809700"},{"name":"Wenjing Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenjing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37677144500"},{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277462600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302520","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"abstract":"A distortion-compensation scheme is proposed for the PAPR reduction of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal.

Concatenating LDPC codes to the transmit diversity achieves the coding gain from the concatenated LDPC codes and the diversity gain from the transmit diversity. In this paper, to feed the soft values to LDPC decoder from multiple transmitter and receiver antennas, we propose on effective algorithm for calculation of soft values from multiple receiver antennas based on LLR. We show that maximum 60% of computational complexity is reduced with a little loss of performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302525.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Computational Algorithm for Space Time Coded System with LDPC codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","Parity check codes","Space technology","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Antenna feeds","Wireless communication","Concatenated codes","Diversity methods","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","concatenated codes","decoding","parity check codes","radiocommunication","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space time code system","LDPC code","low density parity check codes","wireless communication","concatenating code","decoder","multiple transmitter antenna","multiple receiver antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low Computational Algorithm for Space Time Coded System with LDPC codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302525/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952469","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Computational Algorithm for Space Time Coded System with LDPC codes","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048375S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5302540,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Science & Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Li","id":"37598947900"},{"name":"Shiju Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Science & Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shiju","lastName":"Li","id":"37292194000"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Yi","affiliation":["Department of Information Science & Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Yi","id":"37587303000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302540","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Frequency synchronization","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Frequency estimation","Transmitting antennas","Iterative algorithms","Peak to average power ratio","Frequency domain analysis","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint synchronization","channel estimation algorithm","MIMO-OFDM system","multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplex"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an improved synchronization and channel estimation solution for multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplex (MIMO-OFDM) system.

Since only home cell multiple users are included, those algorithms can only combat ISI and MAI between home cell users. Interferences from users of neighbor cells are treated as white noise. When planning network deployment by assigning same frequency band to all cells, which is a merit for TDD system to increase efficiency and capacity, strong intercell interferences occur and the overall performance deteriorates rapidly. To solve this problem, we introduce this new multicell detection algorithm and show its benefit. Essentially, the complexity of the new algorithm will increase tremendously. So we also give an efficient simplifying method for it to be practical without imposing hard requirement to the original hardware platform. Simulation results also show that the new algorithm is effective and satisfying.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302549.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Heuristic Reduced Complexity Computing Method for Multi-Cell Joint Channel Estimation in B3G TDD System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multiple access interference","Interference elimination","Intersymbol interference","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Land mobile radio","Multiuser detection","White noise","Frequency","Capacity planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel estimation","code division multiple access","intersymbol interference","space division multiple access","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heuristic reduced complexity computing method","multicell joint channel estimation","B3G TDD system","intersymbol interference elimination","multiple-access interference interference","TD-SCDMA","LTE cellular mobile radio system","neighbor cells","network planning deployment","multiuser detection","multicell detection algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Heuristic Reduced Complexity Computing Method for Multi-Cell Joint Channel Estimation in B3G TDD System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302549/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302549/","accessionNumber":"10952561","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Heuristic Reduced Complexity Computing Method for Multi-Cell Joint Channel Estimation in B3G TDD System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076811S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5302583,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Yu","affiliation":["Software College, Shenyang Normal University, Sheyang, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Yu","id":"37597021900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302583","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency","Receiving antennas","Multiaccess communication","Transmitting antennas","Mobile antennas","Mobile communication","Directive antennas","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","code division multiple access","mobile radio","space division multiple access","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TD-SCDMA","mobile communication quality","smart antenna beam forming algorithm","optimization"]}],"abstract":"In order to solve between the massive users interaction to cause the mobile communication quality to receive questions and so on influence, this paper follows close on the current communication the hot spot and the difficulty, through the introduction smart antenna's principle of work and the major function.

In amplify-and-forward(AF) OFDM relay system, since the channel between the first hop (source-relay) and the second hop (relay-destination) varies independently, proper sub-carrier mapping (SCM) at the relay has been shown to improve the average end-to-end capacity evidently. However SCM has a poor performance at low SNR. In this paper, assuming that perfect channel knowledge is available at the destination, an adaptive transmission scheme is proposed. The transmission scheme, which is based on instantaneous channel quality, is selected to offer maximum the end-to-end system capacity. The efficiency of the proposed solution is demonstrated by both analytical performance and simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Transmission Scheme for AF-OFDM Relaying Systems with Sub-Carrier Mapping","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302664","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302664.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Transmission Scheme for AF-OFDM Relaying Systems with Sub-Carrier Mapping","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302664/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10953052","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Transmission Scheme for AF-OFDM Relaying Systems with Sub-Carrier Mapping","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063501S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5302685,"authors":[{"name":"Lina Zheng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China","School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37402716900"},{"name":"Ju Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279467700"},{"name":"Dapeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Dapeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537298800"},{"name":"Hui Ji","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Ji","id":"37651193400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302685","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Turbo codes","Transmitting antennas","Delay effects","Fading","Demodulation","Bit error rate","Performance loss","Approximation algorithms","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","maximum likelihood decoding","modulation coding","space-time codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["max-log-MAP decoding algorithm","UST symbol-based turbo code","unitary space-time modulation","time delay","space-time coding technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302685","abstract":"When signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, the performance of unitary space-time modulation (USTM) is unsatisfactory.

In order to combat the impact of ICI on OFDM systems, an ICI mitigation technique by jointing symbol shift cancellation (SSC) and adjacent sub-channel interference filter (ASIF) is proposed in this paper. At first, the symbol shift cancellation (SSC) method is used to cancel the impact of ICI on the far sub-carriers, and then the adjacent sub-channel interference filter (ASIF) method is used to cancel the impact of ICI on the adjacent sub-carriers interference. By analyzing the distribution of the adjacent intercarrier interference, a pilot-symbol scheme is proposed to improve the accuracy of channel estimation and simplify the adjacent interference filter method. The proposed algorithm can achieve trade-off between the bandwidth efficiency and the complexity of ICI cancellation method. Simulation results show that the technique proposed in this paper can effectively improve BER (bit error rate) performance of the OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302708","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302708.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Intercarrier Interference Cancellation Technique Based on SSC-ASIF Scheme in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Intercarrier Interference Cancellation Technique Based on SSC-ASIF Scheme in OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302708/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951892","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5302708/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intercarrier Interference Cancellation Technique Based on SSC-ASIF Scheme in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069943S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5302715,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Li","firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37088046508"},{"name":"Yuchun Wu","firstName":"Yuchun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085469868"},{"name":"Zhenxing Gao","firstName":"Zhenxing","lastName":"Gao","id":"37088044545"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302715","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"abstract":"The use of spatial multiplexing in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems can provide a substantial gain in system throughout. In such systems it is desirable to obtain the post-processing signal to noise ratios (SNRs) of the multiplexed substreams so that channel state information (CSI) can be further derived. A related study shows that if a non-linear receiver is adopted, the post-processing SNRs are determined by the minimum squared Euclidian distance between signal points at the receiver side. In this paper, we design a low complexity algorithm to estimate the minimum squared Euclidian distance using QR decomposition and M-algorithm. Post-processing SNRs are then calculated based on the estimates. Monte Carlo simulations show that under different randomly generated MIMO channel matrices, the new algorithm provides reliable measurements of the post-processing SNRs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302715.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Post-Processing SNR Estimator for Non-Linear Receiver in MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Quality of service","Computational complexity","Channel state information","Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas","Algorithm design and analysis","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","multiplexing","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR estimator","nonlinear receiver","MIMO system","spatial multiplexing","multiinput multioutput system","signal-to-noise ratio","channel state information","minimum squared Euclidian distance","QR decomposition","M-algorithm","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Post-Processing SNR Estimator for Non-Linear Receiver in MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302715/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951897","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Post-Processing SNR Estimator for Non-Linear Receiver in MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043759S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5302726,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Jun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Jun","id":"37669748700"},{"name":"Huiyou Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huiyou","lastName":"Chang","id":"37406777900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4638-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4639-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5302726","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1911},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Simulated annealing","Convergence","Computer science","Sun","Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Iterative algorithms","Neural networks","Fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete binary version","binary improved particle swarm optimization algorithm","discrete variable combinatorial optimization problem","genetic algorithm","simulated annealing algorithm","binary cross particle swarm optimization algorithm","global optimization capacity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302726","abstract":"For discrete variables combinatorial optimization problem, based on gene and simulated annealing algorithms thinking, the improved particle swarm algorithm is proposed in this paper.

User terminals gather the index of codeword which has the maximum SINR (signal to interference plus noise ratio) with its downlink channel vectors and feed it back to the BS.

As the designed HOSM scheme is not gray mapping, we introduce iterative detection to further improve system performance. Simulation results show that the new strategy with superposition 16-QAM modulation (16-QAM SM) outperforms the classical DF system by about 1.5 dB and system with superposition 64-QAM modulation (64-QAM SM) is about 1 dB better than the classical DF scheme. Furthermore, the proposed systems with iterative detection can achieve extra 0.2-0.5 dB gains in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range of interest.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302768","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302768.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Transmission Utilizing High Order Superposition Modulation with Iterative Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Transmission Utilizing High Order Superposition Modulation with Iterative Detection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5302768/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952147","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302768/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Transmission Utilizing High Order Superposition Modulation with Iterative Detection","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055611S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5302803,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjuan Sheng","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wenjuan","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37672917000"},{"name":"Aihuang Guo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Aihuang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37584022500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302803","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Radar tracking","Signal analysis","Time frequency analysis","Information analysis","Signal detection","Signal resolution","Biomedical signal processing","Rail transportation","Wavelet domain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["track long-wave irregularity analysis","fractional Fourier transform","irregularity signal processing tracking","short time Fourier transform"]}],"abstract":"As a generalization of classical Fourier Transformation (FT), the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) outperforms many analysis techniques with its higher time-frequency resolution, but it is quite new to be employed into the track irregularity signal processing.

As conventional estimator can not estimate the channel transfer function (CTF) at virtual carriers, resulting in channel energy leakage after inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT), time-domain filtering method is not directly applicable. To circumvent this problem, we derive least squares (LS) method to estimate the CTF at virtual carriers by using the assumption of limitation of channel impulse response (CIR). Further, by exploiting the noise correlation between signal subspace and noise subspace, we use maximum a posterior (MAP) criterion to estimate the noise in signal subspace and then suppress the estimation error brought by it without the knowledge of channel statistical parameters. In addition to the training mode, the proposed method can also be extended and used in the tracking mode with decision-aided feedback. Simulation results show that the improved method is free of symbol error rate (SER) floor and its SER attains 2 dB improvement in comparison with that of regular LS estimator.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302811","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302811.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Channel Estimation Algorithm for OFDM Systems with Virtual Carriers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302811/","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Channel Estimation Algorithm for OFDM Systems with Virtual Carriers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952326","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302811/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Channel Estimation Algorithm for OFDM Systems with Virtual Carriers","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064728S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5302829,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37678529600"},{"name":"Han-wen Luo","affiliation":["Dept.

The available channels which can be reserved by SUs will depend on the channel usage of PUs and further affect the throughput of SUs. Whenever SUs successfully reserve channel in CI, they will start access reserved channel in next data frame after the end of CI. This will cause the wasted idle waiting time for those SUs which have successfully reserved channel whenever the CI doesn't finish. SUs which couldn't successfully reserve channel in current control frame should try to reserve again in next control frame. Thus, the duration of CI will affect the delay and wasted idle waiting time of SUs. We analyze and simulate the performance of throughput, delay and wasted idle waiting time in DCDSR.

Therefore, it is possible to expand the communication range of UWB systems by increasing the transmitted power of UWB pulse.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10952480","htmlLink":"/document/5302848/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Adaptive Ultra-Wideband Pulse Design Based on Cognitive Radio Theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Adaptive Ultra-Wideband Pulse Design Based on Cognitive Radio Theory","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080283S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5302852,"authors":[{"name":"Xianwen Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xianwen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37678393100"},{"name":"Tiecheng Song","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tiecheng","lastName":"Song","id":"37391687100"},{"name":"Bo Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37673478000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302852","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference suppression","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Downlink","Switches","Resource management","Mobile communication","Laboratories","System performance","Communication switching","3G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel allocation","code division multiple access","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-slot interference suppression","TD-SCDMA system","slow dynamic channel allocation","asymmetrical service","downlink slot","uplink slot","slot allocation direction","virtual cell","time-division-synchronous code-division multiple access","3G mobile communication system"]}],"abstract":"Slow dynamic channel allocation (Slow DCA) is a key technology used to support asymmetrical services between uplink and downlink in TD-SCDMA system, which may cause cross-slot interference when a cell is active in downlink slot while an adjacent one is in uplink slot. The crossed slot existing among adjacent cells will seriously affect the system performance. In this paper, we give a brief analysis about how the cross-slot interference emerges and how it influences TDSCDMA system. Three schemes commonly used to suppress this interference are introduced. One is based on slots allocation direction, and the other two are separately based on region division in a cell and \"virtual cell\". Performances of each scheme are compared in an OPNET simulation scenario. Results show that the scheme based on \"virtual cell\" has a better performance compared with the other two schemes and it is proved to be the most practical one in the three schemes for solving the cross-slot problem.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302852","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302852.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison on Schemes for Suppressing Cross-Slot Interference in TD-SCDMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302852/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison on Schemes for Suppressing Cross-Slot Interference in TD-SCDMA System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952482","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302852/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison on Schemes for Suppressing Cross-Slot Interference in TD-SCDMA System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038774S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5302858,"authors":[{"name":"Weina Song","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weina","lastName":"Song","id":"37671172600"},{"name":"Tiecheng Song","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tiecheng","lastName":"Song","id":"37391687100"},{"name":"Bo Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37673478000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302858","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Signal to noise ratio","Statistics","Throughput","Antenna theory","Analytical models","Communication systems","Communication switching","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","code division multiple access","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna","TD-SCDMA simulation platform","smart antenna technique","fixed multi-beam switching antenna","adaptive antenna array","downlink beam forming implementations","signal-to-noise ratio","isotropic antenna"]}],"abstract":"Smart antenna technique is one of the most important techniques used in TD-SCDMA system. Setting up a methodology to implement smart antennas based on TD-SCDMA system level simulation platform is useful for analyzing the influences of smart antennas on the whole communication system. Generally speaking, smart antennas can be divided into two kinds, one is fixed multi-beam switching antenna and the other is adaptive antenna. This paper proposes a methodology to implement adaptive antenna in TD-SCDMA simulation platform by establishing the node model of Node B, raising the orientation methodology of the adaptive antenna array, and giving the detailed process of downlink beam forming implementations as well. Theoretically, statistics such as SNR (signal to noise ratio) at UE (user equipment) and throughput at Node B are larger for systems adopting adaptive antenna than isotropic antenna. Through running simulations and collecting statistics of SNR and throughput, the proposed methodology is verified to be feasible and appropriate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation Methodology of Adaptive Antenna in TD-SCDMA Simulation Platform","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302858","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302858.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Implementation Methodology of Adaptive Antenna in TD-SCDMA Simulation Platform","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302858/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952566","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation Methodology of Adaptive Antenna in TD-SCDMA Simulation Platform","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102942S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5302878,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhen Jia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yizhen","lastName":"Jia","id":"37532721600"},{"name":"Youzheng Wang","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youzheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281422400"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278637500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302878","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Radio spectrum management","Radiofrequency interference","MIMO","Downlink","Upper bound","Base stations","Heuristic algorithms","Lagrangian functions","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative OFDMA cellular system","base station","weighted sum rate maximization","block-diagonalization","Lagrangian dual decomposition","frequency allocation","space resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a joint frequency and space resources allocation in an OFDMA cellular system with base stations (BSs) cooperation.

The main feature of this scheme is making use of the characteristics of SVC. This method fully meets the encryption requirements of SVC and the encryption procedures are carried out at the network abstractor layer (NAL) level. Based on the different structure and importance of base tier and enhancement tiers, different domains are encrypted. For base tier, intra-prediction mode (IPM) and residual sign are selected. For enhancement tiers, temporal scalability and spatial/SNR scalability are distinguished. Furthermore, key generation and distribution schemes are presented. Stream cipher-Leak Extraction (LEX) algorithm is adopted to reduce computational cost. Experiments were performed to verify the proposed method using the joint scalable video model (JSVM), and the experimental results show that the proposed method protects the SVC streams effectively and supports full scalability; meanwhile, it can guarantee the robustness to transmission errors.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5302934","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05302934.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5302934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layered Encryption for Scalable Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302934/","displayDocTitle":"Layered Encryption for Scalable Video Coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955964","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5302934/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layered Encryption for Scalable Video Coding","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-28-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054405S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5302934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5302947,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology & Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37403440900"},{"name":"Xia Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology & Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406554700"},{"name":"Marek E.

We investigate the optimal location of the relay stations aiming to maximize system throughput. We also focus on the impact of different relay strategies (i.e., decode-and-forward vs. amplify-and-forward) for each source-destination pair on the network performance. For a wireless network operating in a multiuser frequency-selective slow-fading environment, it is an important task for the network operator to decide where to place the relay stations and how to relay. Through a system lever simulation, we obtain the network performance of our proposed approach in an OFDMA based cooperative environment for different relay locations and different relay strategies. In the end, we give the optimal location of RS and present the impact of RS number on the system capacity under our assumptions. Our approach will be heuristic in practice for the deployment of relay stations in the networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302967/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10952982","htmlLink":"/document/5302967/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Relay Location in OFDMA Based Cooperative Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Relay Location in OFDMA Based Cooperative Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04406S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5302972,"authors":[{"name":"Chunli Dong","affiliation":["College of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China","Dept. of Information Engineering, Nanjing College of Traffic Vocational Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chunli","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085911706"},{"name":"Yuning Dong","affiliation":["College of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China","College of Communication and Information Engineering, Suzhou University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuning","lastName":"Dong","id":"37291356700"},{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Office of College, Nanjing College of Traffic Vocational Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085915415"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302972","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Cognitive radio","Filtering","Educational institutions","Fading","Kalman filters","Wireless communication","State estimation","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","particle filtering (numerical methods)","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive channel prediction model","cognitive radio systems","flat Rayleigh fading channels","particle filtering"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autoregressive Channel Prediction Model for Cognitive Radio","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302972.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302972","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302972","abstract":"An autoregressive channel prediction model is presented for cognitive radio systems.

This paper compares systematic measurements of MIMO-OFDM channel capacity in presence of pedestrians with predicted MIMO-OFDM channel capacity values using geometric optics-based ray tracing techniques. Capacity results are presented for a single room environment using 5.2 GHz with 2 times 2, 3 times 3 and 4 times 4 arrays as well as a 2.45 GHz narrowband 8 times 8 MIMO array. The analysis shows an increase of up to 2 b/s/Hz on instant channel capacity with up to 3 pedestrians. There is an increase of up to 1 b/s/Hz in the average capacity of the 4 times 4 MIMO-OFDM channel when the number of pedestrians goes from 1 to 3. Additionally, an increment of up to 2.5 b/s/Hz in MIMO-OFDM channel capacity was measured for a 4 times 4 array compared to a 2 times 2 array in presence of pedestrians. Channel capacity values derived from this analysis are important in terms of understanding the limitations and possibilities for MIMO-OFDM systems in indoor populated environments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel capacity","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","OFDM","Indoor environments","Wireless LAN","Antenna arrays","Ray tracing","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","indoor radio","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","road traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor MIMO-OFDM channel capacity","pedestrian movement","wireless system","geometric optics-based ray tracing technique","temporal variation","pedestrian traffic"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302977","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302977.pdf","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pedestrians Effects on Indoor MIMO-OFDM Channel Capacity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pedestrians Effects on Indoor MIMO-OFDM Channel Capacity","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10952986","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5302977/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5302977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrians Effects on Indoor MIMO-OFDM Channel Capacity","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-03-010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05328S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5302977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5302978,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Shao","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Key Laboratory of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Shao","id":"37594935500"},{"name":"Kuixi Yin","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Key Laboratory of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kuixi","lastName":"Yin","id":"37410701900"},{"name":"Xin Liang","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Key Laboratory of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37599827100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5302978","dbTime":"45 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5302978","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation delay","Equations","Computer simulation","Contracts","Markov processes","Laboratories","Packaging","Throughput","Probability","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","code division multiple access","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonzero propagation delay ACK-ALOHA-CDMA channels","channel model","Markov model","equilibrium equation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302978","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05302978.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of the Non-Zero Propagation Delay ACK-ALOHA-CDMA Channels","abstract":"A new kind of performance evaluation method for non-zero propagation ACK-ALOHA-CDMA channels is proposed in this paper.

With the price of signal processing at the receivers, parallel transmissions in the same frequency is resolvable, given that channel matrix can be obtained. This whole system can be seen as a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system which is known to increase capacity of a wireless system up to M folds where M is the maximum channel matrix rank. The results show that maximum throughput of the system increases linearly with the number of receiving antennas while the associated average collision increases slightly. However, if the traffic intensity remains fixed, average collision diminishes significantly as number of receiving antennas increases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Access protocols","MIMO","Channel estimation","Receiving antennas","Wireless mesh networks","Road accidents","Media Access Protocol","Bandwidth","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","signal processing","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum throughput","ALOHA","multiple antenna technique","performance evaluation","medium access protocol","signal processing","parallel transmissions","channel matrix","multiple-input-multiple-output system","wireless system","receiving antennas","traffic intensity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303019","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303019.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Throughput of ALOHA Employing Multiple Antenna Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Throughput of ALOHA Employing Multiple Antenna Technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303019/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303019/","accessionNumber":"10951898","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Throughput of ALOHA Employing Multiple Antenna Technique","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"05-02-027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03216S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5303029,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Moreover data detection stage is obtained in parallel, using this structure. MRC is applied for SIMO detection which leads to Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) enhancement and significant bit error rate (BER) reduction.

The input-output relation of this system is derived in closed-form in the frequency domain. Based on the result, two novel approaches are proposed to jointly estimate and compensate the distortion coefficients. The first method utilizes least square algorithm, while the second employs an adaptive normalized least mean square algorithm. The simulation results show that both approaches can almost reach the performance of the system without I/Q imbalances in the time-invariant multipath channels. By utilizing decision feedback scheme, the adaptive method outperforms the least square method in the time-varying fading channels at high signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303040","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303040.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation and Compensation of Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalances in OFDM Systems over Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation and Compensation of Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalances in OFDM Systems over Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303040/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951978","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5303040/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation and Compensation of Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalances in OFDM Systems over Fading Channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059017S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5303043,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Shao","affiliation":["Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Shao","id":"37594935500"},{"name":"Xin Liang","affiliation":["Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37599827100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303043","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Cognitive radio","OFDM","Chromium","Space technology","Interference","Power system modeling","Wireless communication","Communications technology","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction","NC-OFDM system","cognitive radio","intelligence wireless communication technology","cognitive user","licensed user","noncontiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","peak-to-average power ratio","interference","PTS method","data transfer","partial transmit sequence"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is one kind of emerging intelligence wireless communication technology.

However, the NC available sub-carriers bring new challenges on system design. The pattern of known signals in frequency domain, such as preamble and pilots is vulnerable by NC subcarriers. Several recent researches have studied synchronization issues for NC-OFDM. In this paper, we study the comb-type pilot channel estimation and interpolation for NC-OFDM transmission. Firstly, three types of channel estimation strategies are revealed. And then, we proposed the Shift Pilot (SP) scheme by inserting some punched pilots on other available sub-carriers of data at transmitter. A preprocessor is introduced between channel estimation and interpolation at receiver to estimate channel values of punched pilots. The enhanced strategy achieves better performance with a reasonable complexity in NC-OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303081","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303081.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comb-Type Pilot Aided Channel Estimation in Non-Contiguous OFDM Systems for Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303081/","displayDocTitle":"Comb-Type Pilot Aided Channel Estimation in Non-Contiguous OFDM Systems for Cognitive Radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952152","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303081/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comb-Type Pilot Aided Channel Estimation in Non-Contiguous OFDM Systems for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043947S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5303082,"authors":[{"name":"Yapeng Wang","affiliation":["MPI-QMUL Information System Research Centre, Macao Polytechnic Institute, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Yapeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281422300"},{"name":"Xu Yang","affiliation":["MPI-QMUL Information System Research Centre, Macao Polytechnic Institute, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37289759300"},{"name":"Ning Lu","affiliation":["MPI-QMUL Information System Research Centre, Macao Polytechnic Institute, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Lu","id":"37841451100"},{"name":"Athen Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Athen","lastName":"Ma","id":"37304074300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303082","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"abstract":"This paper extends the previous study on geographic load balancing techniques for WCDMA networks using novel semi-smart antennas.

Simulations show significant system capacity improvement when non-uniform user traffic exists. The key extension to previous work is to modify the original algorithm and make it to work in a geographical constrained environment like in a city where multi-path propagations can not be ignored. A comprehensive simulation package has been build to create and exam scenarios, perform simulations, and check simulation results. The new simulation package has greatly improved usability and productivity. With this tool, the semi-smart antenna based intelligent control for WCDMA networks can be examined with complex scenarios and constrained city environment.

For low BER, MC method requires huge sample sizes to achieve certain efficiency. To overcome this limitation, many variance reduction techniques such as importance sampling (IS) have been proposed. In this paper, a novel simulation method Monte Carlo simulation with error classification (EC-MC) is discussed. This method can reduce the estimation variance through dividing the total errors into many sub-categories and optimizing the simulation sample size for each sub-category. We apply this method for simulations of QAM modulation under Rayleigh fading channel. The simulation results demonstrate EC-MC method can achieve the same accuracy at smaller sample sizes and shorter simulation runtime, comparing with both conventional MC and IS methods, especially at high signal to noise ratios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte Carlo Simulation with Error Classification for QAM Modulation under Rayleigh Fading Channel","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303091","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303091.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo Simulation with Error Classification for QAM Modulation under Rayleigh Fading Channel","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303091/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952158","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo Simulation with Error Classification for QAM Modulation under Rayleigh Fading Channel","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-03-017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108355S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5303106,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Zhang","affiliation":["IMCS, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37675612800"},{"name":"Yinghong Tian","affiliation":["IMCS, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yinghong","lastName":"Tian","id":"37669666900"},{"name":"Jianming Cui","affiliation":["IMCS, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianming","lastName":"Cui","id":"37672085600"},{"name":"Hua Yang","affiliation":["IMCS, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Yang","id":"37674443200"},{"name":"Zongsheng Lai","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Nanophotonics & Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zongsheng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37266267500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303106","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":202},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a uniform all-integer quantization for irregular LDPC decoder.

According to the characteristics of femto network, a management information model (MIM) is proposed to provide information support for management of femto network, including managed objects, management information, measurements and their monitoring granularities. Since the link between femto BS and femto gateway (FB-FBGW) changes dynamically, FB-FBGW model adopts a status attribute to keep instance of the link stable, which would be helpful for operators to aggregate traffic volume over one link conveniently and quickly. Based on the MIM, a femto network autonomic configuration management system (FACMS) with its architecture is given. The MIM is validated by illustrating autonomic configuration procedure of femto BS with FACMS. FACMS could fulfill autonomic configuration of femto BS considering radio environments. Comparing with traditional fixed method, FACMS moves the optimization procedure of radio environments ahead to avoid potential interference, which help to improve transmission efficiency and quality of telecommunication services.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Modeling and Autonomic Configuration Management of Femto Network","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303113","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303113.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Information Modeling and Autonomic Configuration Management of Femto Network","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303113/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952251","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Modeling and Autonomic Configuration Management of Femto Network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"06-05-030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042567S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-28"},{"_id":5303121,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-jun Han","affiliation":["Fac.

OFDMA radio resources are the scarce good with their dimensions bandwidth, time and space. Due to frequency selective fading the effective path-loss varies in all dimensions. Adaptive algorithms are available which allocate the best modulation and coding scheme depending on the expected SINR, as well as dynamic subchannel assignment which aims to choose the best subchannel for each user. This already boosts the performance of OFDMA system. However, these algorithms alone do not touch the transmitted power per subchannel. On the cell edge this is fine, but large areas are covered with a transmitted power exceeding the usually required SINR. In this paper we introduce a power control which saves power on the users within the cell. This leads to a reduced interference into neighbor cells, especially for future reuse one systems. Also some of the saved power can be used to boost transmissions at the cell edge. In this paper we introduce an adaptive power control concept and arrange it into a closed loop control system which contains blocks for all adaptive algorithms for modulation, power, subchannel usage and channel quality indication.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303129","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303129.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Power Control for 4G OFDMA Systems on Frequency Selective Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303129/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Power Control for 4G OFDMA Systems on Frequency Selective Fading Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952333","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303129/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Power Control for 4G OFDMA Systems on Frequency Selective Fading Channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049849S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5303144,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiming Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kaiming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37278620700"},{"name":"Yuan'an Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan'an","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279411900"},{"name":"Bihua Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bihua","lastName":"Tang","id":"37531282500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303144","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","OFDM modulation","Partitioning algorithms","Power distribution","Power engineering and energy","Closed-form solution","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Modulation coding","Bit rate","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","error statistics","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power loading algorithm","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","arbitrary square M-QAM mode","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","bit error rate","closed-form expression"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive power loading algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with given arbitrary square M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation(MQAM) modes on subcarriers is proposed in this paper.

Sequences","abstract":"Optimum partial transmit sequence method (OPTS), as one of the highest-performance PAPR reduction techniques, has very high computational complexity. Most sub-optimal schemes which are based on iterative PTS (IPTS), aim at balancing PAPR reduction performance and complexity by expanding the searching space of phase factor sequence with more iterative operations. A novel scheme is presented to further lower the complexity of PTS. This scheme samples every partial transmit sequence, obtains some peak-position samples with the largest magnitudes and then constructs PTS sampling sequence. A proper phase factor sequence can be got through processing PTS sampling sequences according to the principle of OPTS or sub-optimal PTS. Because PTS sampling sequences have fewer samples, the new method can achieve a low complexity. Besides, simulation results show that the new scheme has good PAPR reduction performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5303146/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952412","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel PAPR Reduction Technique by Sampling Partial Transmit Sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel PAPR Reduction Technique by Sampling Partial Transmit Sequences","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048463S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5303180,"authors":[{"name":"Chunchang Tian","affiliation":["Wireless Res.

Usually, it is divided into two main areas. One is codebook based precoding (CBP), and the other is non-codebook based precoding (NBP). For the channel reciprocity property, the eigen-based beamforming (EBB) is a promising case in the NBP group. We study both the CBP and EBB in UTRAN LTE in this paper. First, we have proposed a novel rank adaptation algorithm which can improve the system performance and reduce the complexity. Next, a new truncated outer-loop power control algorithm is presented to mitigate the intercell interference. Finally, the performance of EBB and CBP are compared in four aspects. They are in the antenna array gain, the coverage ability, the frequency selective scheduling gain and the dual-polarized antenna case. The simulation results are provided using dynamic system level simulator.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303180.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis on Codebook Based Precoding and Eigen Based Beamforming in UTRAN LTE","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5303180/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis on Codebook Based Precoding and Eigen Based Beamforming in UTRAN LTE","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952577","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis on Codebook Based Precoding and Eigen Based Beamforming in UTRAN LTE","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058466S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5303195,"authors":[{"name":"Hancheng Liao","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Hancheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37289382800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303195","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303195","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Maximum likelihood decoding","Detection algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Iterative decoding","Detectors","Code division multiplexing","Multiaccess communication","Computational complexity","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","code division multiplexing","communication complexity","genetic algorithms","iterative methods","maximum likelihood decoding","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sphere decoding","GA-based multiuser detection","synchronous LAS multicode system","large-area-synchronized code division multiple access system","multiplexing capacity","LAS-CDMA system","computational complexity","optimum detection algorithm","maximum-likelihood rule","genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303195","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303195.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sphere Decoding Assisted GA-Based Multiuser Detection for Synchronous LAS Multicode System","abstract":"Multicode system is designed to get more spreading sequences and get higher multiplexing capacity in large-area-synchronized code division multiple access (LAS-CDMA) system.

An iterative channel estimation algorithm based on superimposed pilot is proposed for the combination of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) system. This algorithm makes full use of the information provided by decoding, and has two steps. Firstly, pilots are added to the transmitted signals. The initial estimation employs the first-order statistics. Secondly, using the hard-decision feedback information provided by the decoding of BICM , the information between the channel estimator and the decoder could be exchanged. The accuracy could be improved by the feedback information provided by iterative decoding of BICM. Through the wideband HF channel, the simulation results show that, compared with conventional superimposed pilot algorithm, the proposed algorithm efficiently improves the accuracy of channel estimation and BER performance after two iterations.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303358","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile

In particular, the closed forms for the normalized average number of sensing bits, the probabilities of the detection and the false-alarm are derived.

There have been presented different algorithms for decoding of this class of code such as maximum likelihood (ML), bit flipping (BF), a posteriori probability (APP) and sum product (SP) algorithms that the first two of them decode by hard criterion and two others decode by soft criterion. In this article, considering LDPC codes structure and taking advantage of LDPC codes demonstrated by Tanner graph, we have presented a quite new method based on multi layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks that decodes LDPC codes by soft decision manner. This method opens another new way for LDPC and even other block codes decoding. Simulation results display good performance of this method compared to other known algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303382","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Networks Decoder for LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Networks Decoder for LDPC Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303382/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952074","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5303382/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Networks Decoder for LDPC Codes","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063626S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5303395,"authors":[{"name":"Yongxu Xue","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongxu","lastName":"Xue","id":"37674545700"},{"name":"Changchuan Yin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Changchuan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37272677500"},{"name":"Guangxin Yue","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangxin","lastName":"Yue","id":"37271317200"},{"name":"Danpu Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Danpu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277009500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303395","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Feedback","Downlink","Traffic control","Quality of service","Laboratories","Wireless communication","Frequency conversion","Base stations","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","OFDM modulation","quality of service","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS-aware resource allocation","downlink OFDMA system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","channel quality indicator","quality of service","spectrum efficiency","feedback load"]}],"abstract":"In orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based systems, base station (BS) can adaptively adjust modulation and coding parameters according to channel quality indicator (CQI) fed back, therefore spectrum efficiency can be significantly improved.

The analysis method is based on the first order perturbation expansion of the projection operator. This technique takes advantage of the algebraic simplicity of the perturbation analysis of linear operators. The probability density is derived from the asymptotic properties of the sample covariance matrix estimated from finite samples. It is shown that, unlike the SMI beamformer, the probability density function depends on the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix when the interference-to-noise ratio is not high enough.

sharing is of special significance among all the key technologies in cognitive radio (CR), such as spectrum sensing, spectrum management and power allocation etc. Since all the efforts in CR directly aim at enhancing spectrum utilization and spectrum sharing is the final step of all these key technologies, spectrum sharing completely determines whether CR is just a theoretical topic or a practically feasible technology. In this paper, a novel spectrum sharing strategy based on the throughput model in a cognitive radio network (CRN) is proposed, in which maximum theoretical throughput is taken into account on the research of spectrum sharing in CR. And then an optimization problem in the form of binary integer linear programming (BILP) to describe this model is formulated and a directional search (DS) algorithm to solve this BILP problem is designed.

It can flexibly adapt transmission rates by changing both time and frequency spreading factors and possesses many physical-layer advantages in dispersive fading channels. Power control errors (PCE) degrade the performance of the MC-DS-CDMA system. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of different detectors in receiver and the effect of various time and frequency spreading factors and the effect of PCE on the single rate and multirate MC-DSCDMA system in a Rayleigh fading channel with perfect channel estimation. By simulation, we obtain some important insights into the performance of the MC-DS-CDMA system. These insights are according to the following subjects. First off all MRC detection method compared with MMSE and EGC methods results in higher performance in a high capacity system. Afterward we conclude that Increasing frequency-or time domain spreading gain can improve the performance of the MCDSCDMA system, but the system becomes more sensitive to power control errors and SNR variations. More PCE can exacerbate the performance of the MC-DS-CDMA system. Performance variation in term of BER becomes more sensitive in larger frequency-domain diversity and timedomain spreading gain.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303501","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303501.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of the MC-DS-CDMA Systems with PCE and Variable Spreading Factors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303501/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the MC-DS-CDMA Systems with PCE and Variable Spreading Factors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952588","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303501/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the MC-DS-CDMA Systems with PCE and Variable Spreading Factors","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09245S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5303543,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongli Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China","School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291908300"},{"name":"Xueshan Gao","affiliation":["Intelligent Robotics Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xueshan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37290875400"},{"name":"Baochang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electric Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Baochang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405129100"},{"name":"Hao Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37676110700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5303543","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Mobile robots","Real time systems","Stereo vision","Robot vision systems","Cameras","Intelligent robots","Robotics and automation","Tracking","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","mobile robots","motion control","motion estimation","stereo image processing","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wheeled mobile robot","motion estimation","motion control","real time stereo vision","floor plane extraction","onboard stereo vision","disparity map","Euclidean space","simple least squares method","fitting parameters","tracking results"]}],"abstract":"Vision-based motion estimation is a key technique in autonomously mobile robot. This paper presents an integrated method for motion estimation of the mobile robot based on floor plane extraction. The whole processes include floor plane extraction, pose estimation of the onboard stereo vision system and motion estimation of the mobile robot. First, based on disparity map obtained from the onboard real-time stereo vision system, a two-stage method is used for fast floor plane extraction. Then all the points belong to the floor plane are transformed from disparity space to Euclidean space, and a simple least squares method is employed to fit the floor plane. The fitting parameters of the floor plane are used for the pose estimation of the onboard stereo vision system.

Under this setting, the relevant fairness criterion is the stabilization of all buffer queues which guarantees a bounded average delay for all users. It has been shown that maximizing a queue-length-weighted sum of the rates is an optimal in the sense that it can guarantee stability of the system. A good cross layer scheduling scheme should jointly consider the queue length and the channel variation of the channel from the physical layer. The average delay, average throughput, and average user queue length of the channel-aware-only scheduling, queue-aware-only scheduling and joint channel-aware and queue-aware scheduling are evaluated. Simulation results show that the joint channel-aware and queue-aware scheduling algorithm can take full advantage of the multiuser diversity gain and provide average delay (or throughput) and fairness improvement compared with channel-aware-only schemes and queue-aware-only schemes.","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303549.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput-Optimal Scheduling for Downlink Zero-Forcing SDMA Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-Optimal Scheduling for Downlink Zero-Forcing SDMA Systems","htmlLink":"/document/5303549/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10952750","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-Optimal Scheduling for Downlink Zero-Forcing SDMA Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09554S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5303565,"authors":[{"name":"Xiong Run","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiong Run","id":"37679529100"},{"name":"Chen Bin","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Chen Bin","id":"37445220600"},{"name":"Yin Qin","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yin Qin","id":"37674932400"},{"name":"Yang Xiaoshuan","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yang Xiaoshuan","id":"37681814400"},{"name":"Zhou Bihua","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Zhou Bihua","id":"37426462300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4344-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5303565","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Reflection","Sparse matrices","Polynomials","Maxwell equations","Matrix decomposition","Transmission line matrix methods","EMP radiation effects","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic shielding","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thin slot formalism","FDTD analysis","thin slot penetration","ground reflection","rectangular enclosure model","shielding effectiveness","contour pass integral"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDTD","shielding enclosure","thin-slot","C-TSF","CP","ETSF"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new rectangular enclosure model for shielding effectiveness (SE) is established, which is in more accordant with practical engineering environment for it considered the ground reflection.

The full search matching algorithm based on pixel gray correlation achieves high accuracy, but can hardly be implemented in real time due to mass of calculation. This paper presents the design of a fast image matching system with high precision and processing capacity of images with various sizes. Under the framework of parallel processing, the formula in correlation coefficients matching is improved. A highly paralleled MAC array is carefully designed to maximize the capability of the reconfigurable logical units inside FPGA. Besides, a combination of delay-switch array and asynchronous reset reduces the complexity of parallel array inputs switch. It also enables the support of images with variable sizes. The system is implemented on Altera Stratix II EP2S60F672 platform. The time for correlation calculation to search a 80*80 real-time image in a 512*512 reference image is about 206ms, with a precision no less than 10\"5 and a less than 50% consumption of system resources.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5303569","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05303569.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5303569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Efficient Implementation of Image Matching Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303569/","displayDocTitle":"High Efficient Implementation of Image Matching Algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955974","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303569/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Efficient Implementation of Image Matching Algorithm","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-12-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072501S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5303569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5303570,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Vafi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and IT, Charles Darwin University, Darwin, Australia"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Vafi","id":"37284835500"},{"name":"Tadeusz Wysocki","affiliation":["School of Computer and Electronics Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Omaha, USA"],"firstName":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Wysocki","id":"37280338700"},{"name":"Mehran Abolhasan","affiliation":["ICT, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Mehran","lastName":"Abolhasan","id":"37282203000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303570","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":237},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303570","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Turbo codes","Iterative decoding","Convolutional codes","Block codes","Convolution","Forward error correction","Parity check codes","Australia","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","concatenated codes","convolutional codes","interleaved codes","iterative decoding","random codes","recursive estimation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["serially concatenated turbo codes","recursive systematic convolutional codes","Bose Ray Chaudhuri Hocquenghem codes","error floor regions","iterative decoding structure","SCT codes","pseudo-random interleaver","minimum distance values"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a new scheme of concatenated codes, referred to as serially concatenated turbo (SCT) codes.

Noise reduction is the first step to image processing. But the noise reduction and edge localization are contradictory, which makes edge detection is an ill-posed problem. In multi-scale edge detection using wavelet transform (WT), the scale selection is one key problem. In small scale, edges can be localized accurately, but are sensitive to noise, while in large scale, noise can be suppressed effectively, but edges may deviate from original location. Edges can be detected exactly only when scale selected is a good compromise of these two factors. In this paper, seven edge types are modeled and the scale selection is analyzed for each type.

Mesh size and lightning channel length can greatly affect calculation speed in lightning electromagnetic field calculation. In this paper, Influences of different mesh sizes and the lightning channel lengths on the calculation have been discussed. Very strait grid can be used in lightning electromagnetic field calculation without any scatter object; however, too strait grid will cause error when scatter object is taken into consideration. The proposed 7500 m channel length is not necessary for lightning electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the channel. Shorter channel can be used to calculate the nearby lightning electromagnetic fields; closer the area we care about is, shorter the channel is necessary.","doi":"10.1109/CEEM.2009.5303591","publicationTitle":"2009 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Environmental Electromagnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Environmental Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5284322/5301386/05303591.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEEM.2009.5303591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5301386","startPage":"349","endPage":"352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influences of mesh size and lightning channel length on lightning electromagnetic field calculation using FDTD algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influences of mesh size and lightning channel length on lightning electromagnetic field calculation using FDTD algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303591/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955173","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5303591/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influences of mesh size and lightning channel length on lightning electromagnetic field calculation using FDTD algorithm","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035108S","chronDate":"16-20 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5284322","isNumber":"5301386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5284322","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5301386","articleId":"5303591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5303597,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanghong Tang","affiliation":["College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhanghong","lastName":"Tang","id":"37672655500"},{"name":"Qun Wang","affiliation":["College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Qun Wang","id":"37674664600"},{"name":"Hongxia Guo","affiliation":["College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hongxia Guo","id":"37673259200"},{"name":"Meiwu Shi","affiliation":["The Quartermaster Equipment Research Institute of the General Logistics Department of the PLA, Beijing 100082, China"],"lastName":"Meiwu Shi","id":"37668645600"},{"name":"Maohui Li","affiliation":["The Quartermaster Equipment Research Institute of the General Logistics Department of the PLA, Beijing 100082, China"],"lastName":"Maohui Li","id":"37675097100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4344-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5303597","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"abstract":"A domain map finite element method was applied to the three dimensional (3-D) numerical mode-matching (NMM) method to solve the 3-D electric logging problem. This method divides the infinite field domain of every layer into inner and outer field domains, in inner domain the matrices are formed by standard FEM and in outer domain, the Kelvin transformation is applied and the matrices are formed by a new infinite element format. Matrices of two different parts are coupled in the domains' common interface to form the final matrices of the original problem. This method generates smaller size of generalized matrices than original 3-D NMM method. In addition, this method changes the distribution of eigenvalues which needs less eigenvalues under the same error. Results show that the new method spends only 1/7 CPU time and uses only 1/3 memory of the original method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Environmental Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5284322/5301386/05303597.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"356","publicationTitle":"2009 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Environmental Electromagnetics","doi":"10.1109/CEEM.2009.5303597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEEM.2009.5303597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5301386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A domain map finite element method for solving open boundary electromagnetic field problem and its application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Electromagnetic fields","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Equations","Kelvin","Nonhomogeneous media","Transforms","Conductivity","Educational institutions","Logistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary-elements methods","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domain map finite element method","open boundary electromagnetic field problem","numerical mode-matching method","3D electric logging problem","generalized matrix eigenvalue problem","Kelvin transformation","resistivity log"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Domain Map Finite Element Method","Open Boundary","Generalized Matrix Eigenvalue Problem","Kelvin Transformation","Resistivity Log"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A domain map finite element method for solving open boundary electromagnetic field problem and its application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303597/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955174","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"16-20 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A domain map finite element method for solving open boundary electromagnetic field problem and its application","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058894S","chronDate":"16-20 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5284322","isNumber":"5301386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5284322","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5301386","articleId":"5303597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5303623,"authors":[{"name":"Yin Qin","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yin Qin","id":"37674932400"},{"name":"Chen Bin","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Chen Bin","id":"37445220600"},{"name":"Xiong Run","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiong Run","id":"37679529100"},{"name":"Yang Xiaoshuan","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yang Xiaoshuan","id":"37681814400"},{"name":"Zhou Bihua","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Zhou Bihua","id":"37426462300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4344-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5303623","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Polynomials","Difference equations","Perfectly matched layers","Geophysics computing","Hip","Mathematical model","Optical fiber communication","Integrated optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","inhomogeneous media","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cylindrical coordinate","perfectly matched layer implementation","finite difference time domain analysis","weighted Laguerre polynomial"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unconditionally stable FDTD","weighted Laguerre polynomials(WLP)","Cylindrical coordinates","PML"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a perfectly matched layer (PML) implementation for an unconditionally stable finite-difference time-domain scheme based on weighted Laguerre polynomials(WLP-FDTD) in cylindrical coordinates is presented.

Each receiver sends the label of the best beamforming vector to the transmitter through finite rate limited feedback. Private code book is shared between each transmitter-receiver pair to prevent the decoding of other user's information. In this work, the capacity loss due to quantized beamforming is derived.

MIMO precoding is an effective MIMO multiplex mode to improve throughput, and CDD is an efficient transmit diversity scheme suitable for OFDM radio access. In this contribution the principle and system structure of MIMO precoding based on CDD is introduced. The system throughput of the CDD-based precoding with codebook-based precoding according to delay sample, codebook size and RB size for PMI and CQI feedback is evaluated.

According to the shift-invariance of the NSCT, the approximate translations, which will be used to create the search windows of the fine registration, are obtained. Next, the local searches are operated in subband images, and then the feature points, which are extracted by using NSCT coefficients, are matched by utility of the gray correlation, and finally we can calculate the transformation parameters. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in the noise suppression and the high registration accuracy which can achieve 0.2 pixels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image registration","Image sequences","Histograms","Roads","Tracking","Matched filters","Kalman filters","Layout","Image reconstruction","Gray-scale"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","Fourier transforms","image registration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-stage astronomical images registration","nonsubsampled contourlet transform","coarse registration","fine registration","transformation parameters","noise suppression","space images","edge detection","image interpolation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5303675","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05303675.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5303675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Stage Astronomical Images Registration Based on Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Stage Astronomical Images Registration Based on Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303675/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303675/","accessionNumber":"10955269","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Stage Astronomical Images Registration Based on Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05721S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5303675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5303687,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Xu","affiliation":["The Telecommunication Engineering Institute, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Xu","id":"37632471800"},{"name":"Gaofei Sun","affiliation":["The Telecommunication Engineering Institute, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Gaofei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37674555700"},{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Southwest Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37675092600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303687","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Channel estimation","Iterative algorithms","Data engineering","Computational complexity","Convergence","Fading","Decision feedback equalizers","Iterative methods","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data reuse LMS channel estimation algorithm","turbo equalization","channel estimation","iterative methods","computation complexity algorithm","soft decision feedback LMS algorithm","data-reused method","least mean squares methods","turbo code"]}],"abstract":"The channel estimation is a vital part of turbo equalization.

Experimental results show that the identified probability to the image of SNR 2 can reach more than 98% by this method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303727/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10955475","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303727/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Morphological TOP-HAT Filter Optimized with Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Morphological TOP-HAT Filter Optimized with Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03984S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5303727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5303729,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406086600"},{"name":"Yi Cai","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Cai","id":"37673590800"},{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37291355100"},{"name":"Chunye Wang","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks Research and Development, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunye","lastName":"Wang","id":"37676592900"},{"name":"Peter Skov","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks Research and Development, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Skov","id":"38571420700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303729","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":479},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Multiaccess communication","Diversity reception","Scheduling algorithm","Modulation coding","Automatic repeat request","OFDM","Switches","Diversity methods","Radio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","automatic repeat request","feedback","modulation coding","multimedia communication","packet radio networks","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE MBMS baseline","multimedia services","3GPP standard","single frequency network","packet scheduling process","sector-specific adaptive modulation coding","hybrid automatic repeat request","radio channels","feedback","packet scheduling","HARQ","AMC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303729","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303729","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","abstract":"MBMS is an efficient means to provide multimedia services by sharing common radio channels among a group of users. This paper presents performance evaluation of MBMS in LTE framework by a simulator set up according to 3GPP standard. A general comparison is first made among point-topoint (p-t-p), point-to-multipoint (p-t-m) and single frequency network (SFN), which shows that p-t-m with feedback is more efficient than p-t-p, and SFN can lead to remarkable performance enhancement. We also elaborate the packet scheduling process of p-t-m with feedback scheme, which involves sector-specific adaptive modulation coding (AMC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), and then investigate the gain provided by them. It is shown that with moderate user number, fast AMC and HARQ can give 25% and 70% throughput gain respectively. However, this gain decreases with user number.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303729.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of LTE MBMS Baseline","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5303729/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of LTE MBMS Baseline","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952259","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of LTE MBMS Baseline","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07327S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5303733,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Yi Yu","affiliation":["Computer Department, Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China","Scool of Computerv and Information Engineering, Anyang Normal University, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Xiao Yi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37406863100"},{"name":"Aiming Wang","affiliation":["Scool of Computerv and Information Engineering, Anyang Normal University, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Aiming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37402696500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5303733","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303733","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a feature selection and transformation approach for universal steganalysis based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and higher order statistics.

Firstly, the algorithm utilizes the fractal image coding technique to obtain the characteristic data of a gray-level image watermark signal and encrypts it by a symmetric encryption algorithm before it was embedded. Secondly, by exploiting the abilities of neural networks and considering the characteristics of Human Visual System (HVS), a Just Noticeable Difference (JND) threshold controller is designed to ensure the strength of the embedded data adapting to the host image itself entirely. Thus the watermark scheme possesses the dual security characteristics. To improve the robustness of the algorithm, the simple and repetition of the results is applied to watermark configuration. And the CIELab color space is chosen to guarantee the stability of the results. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is invisible and robust against commonly used image-processing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303813/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10955837","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303813/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Color Image Watermarking Algorithm Based on Fractal and Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Color Image Watermarking Algorithm Based on Fractal and Neural Networks","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-08-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063538S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5303813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5303835,"authors":[{"name":"Shengbing Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shengbing","lastName":"Cai","id":"37666151500"},{"name":"Zhemin Duan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhemin","lastName":"Duan","id":"37395427600"},{"name":"Jin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37676130600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303835","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":520},"abstract":"This paper addresses the issues of MIMO detection schemes for LTE uplink at received port when VMIMO scheme is deployed at transmitter, which is always a trade-off between performance and complexity.

Without any increase of the computational complexity, the MPFRFT-based image encryption method owns more secret keys than the encryption methods operated by other fractional Fourier transforms. On the other hand, even though the order of the fractional Fourier transform which is treated as a secret key is known, one still can't decrypt the image correctly, so do the four free parameters. What's more, not only the security of image information increases, but also the encryption process is simpler.

As an extension to the previous works, we start with the no diversity case, and present some alternative closed-form expressions of detection probability under Nakagami channels. Then we pay much attention to studying the square-law combining technology when wireless users experience Nakagami fading (the outputs of all square-law devices are added to yield a new decision statistic), and derive closed-form expressions of detection probability when Nakagami parameters are integral. Interestingly, it is noted that, for a diversity scheme of SLC with L diversity branches, the detection probability in a Nakagami channel with integral Nakagami parameter m is equivalent to that in a Rayleigh channel with mL diversity branches. Finally, performance evaluation is exhibited for different numbers of diversity branches and different values of Nakagami parameters.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303872.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Square-Law Combining for Cognitive Radios over Nakagami Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5303872/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Square-Law Combining for Cognitive Radios over Nakagami Channels","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952923","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Square-Law Combining for Cognitive Radios over Nakagami Channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053344S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5303872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5303889,"authors":[{"name":"Guangqiu Li","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Guangqiu","lastName":"Li","id":"37598722600"},{"name":"Jianrun Ge","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Jianrun","lastName":"Ge","id":"37592175400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303889","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Fading","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Error probability","MIMO","Diversity reception","Radiofrequency interference","Amplitude modulation","Computational modeling","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel estimation","cochannel interference","diversity reception","error statistics","Gaussian processes","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SEP approximation","average symbol error probability","MIMO-MRC system","multiple-input multiple-output maximal-ratio combining system","channel estimation error","CCI","cochannel interference","Rayleigh fading channel","Gaussian Q-function","QAM scheme","rectangular quardrature amplitude modulation","M-ary signaling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the impact of channel estimation error on the average symbol error probability (SEP) of multiple-input multiple-output maximal-ratio combining (MRC) systems in the presence of cochannel interferences (CCIs) in Rayleigh fading channels.

One of these skills is the ability to understand the emotional state of human. This paper describes neural network based approaches for emotion classification. We learn a classifier that can recognize 6 basic emotions with an average accuracy of 83% over the Cohn-Kanade database. The novelty of this work is that instead of empirically selecting the parameters of the neural network, i.e. the learning rate, activation function parameter, momentum number, etc., we developed a strategy that can automatically select comparatively better combination of these parameters. We also introduce another way to perform back propagation. Instead of using the error function to adjust the weights of a neural network, we use optimal algorithms such as Powell algorithm to minimize the error function. We also perform several experiments and show that our hybrid neural network approach can be successfully used for emotion recognition.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5303893","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5303893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05303893.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial Expression Analysis - A Hybrid Neural Network Based Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303893/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Facial Expression Analysis - A Hybrid Neural Network Based Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303893/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10956114","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial Expression Analysis - A Hybrid Neural Network Based Approach","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-13-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121345S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5303893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5303926,"authors":[{"name":"Zhili Zhuang","affiliation":["Inha Witlab, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Zhili","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37672484500"},{"name":"Sunghwan Sohn","affiliation":["Inha Witlab, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunghwan","lastName":"Sohn","id":"37285929900"},{"name":"Junrong Gu","affiliation":["Inha Witlab, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junrong","lastName":"Gu","id":"37673426100"},{"name":"Jaemoung Kim","affiliation":["Inha Witlab, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaemoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293480200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5303926","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303926","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Array signal processing","Cognitive radio","Direction of arrival estimation","Adaptive arrays","Protection","Antenna arrays","Directive antennas","Transmitting antennas","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","cognitive radio","direction-of-arrival estimation","interference suppression","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference mitigation","power efficient adaptive transmit beamforming algorithm","cognitive radio","primary user protection","cognitive user","direction of arrival estimation","circular array antenna","cyclic MUSIC algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303926","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05303926.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5303926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Interference Mitigated and Power Efficient Adaptive Beamforming Algorithm in Cognitive Radio","abstract":"By applying smart beamforming technologies, it is effective to protect primary user (PU) while guarantee that cognitive user (CU) has better spectrum sharing with PU in a rarely conflictual manner.

Traditionally, the specific emitter identification (SEI) depends on analyzing the time-frequency structure within the usage band. In this paper, a new SEI feature extraction approach based on autocorrelation analysis is proposed. To characterize the nonlinearity of the amplifier in the transmitter, the harmonic power constraint characteristic of the output signal of the amplifier is analyzed, and a power series model is applied to describe the output signal. For different amplifiers, harmonic power constraint properties are different. We present the autocorrelation analysis method to estimate each harmonic power spectrum and extract harmonic power ratio signature features from output signal of the amplifier. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation experiments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Power system harmonics","Power amplifiers","Radar countermeasures","Signal processing","Autocorrelation","Harmonic analysis","Signal analysis","Time frequency analysis","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic countermeasures","feature extraction","harmonic analysis","power amplifiers","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","radar emitter","harmonic power constraint","radar countermeasures","specific emitter identification","autocorrelation analysis","power series model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5303962","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05303962.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5303962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Extraction of Radar Emitter Harmonic Power Constraint Based on Nonlinear Characters of the Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feature Extraction of Radar Emitter Harmonic Power Constraint Based on Nonlinear Characters of the Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5303962/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5303962/","accessionNumber":"10955274","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Extraction of Radar Emitter Harmonic Power Constraint Based on Nonlinear Characters of the Amplifier","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"02-40-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037839S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5303962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5303972,"authors":[{"name":"Anant Oonsivilai","affiliation":["Alternative and Sustainable Energy Research Unit, Power and Control Research Group, School of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Engineering, Suranaree University\uc2a0of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand"],"firstName":"Anant","lastName":"Oonsivilai","id":"37444882200"},{"name":"Nittaya Meeboon","affiliation":["Alternative and Sustainable Energy Research Unit, Power and Control Research Group, School of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Engineering, Suranaree University\uc2a0of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand"],"firstName":"Nittaya","lastName":"Meeboon","id":"37088286918"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5303972","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5303972","abstract":"Competiveness of textile industries depends on the quality control of production.

While images are typically represented by feature vectors, the natural distance is often different from the distance induced by the ambient space. The geodesic distances on manifold are used to measure the similarities between images.Based on user interactions in a relevance feedback driven query-by-example system, the intrinsic similarities between images can be accurately estimated. We then develop an algorithmic framework to approximate the optimal mapping function by a radial basis function (RBF) neural network. The semantics of a new image can be inferred by the RBF neural network. Experimental results show that our approach is effective in improving the performance of content-based image retrieval systems.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5304042","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05304042.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5304042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algorithmic Framework to the Optimal Mapping Function by a Radial Basis Function Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Algorithmic Framework to the Optimal Mapping Function by a Radial Basis Function Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10955553","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5304042/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algorithmic Framework to the Optimal Mapping Function by a Radial Basis Function Neural Network","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-15-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072413S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5304042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5304071,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Li","firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Li","id":"37087342013"},{"name":"Yin Lu","firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085905580"},{"name":"Hongbo Zhu","firstName":"Hongbo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37289613500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5304071","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Voting","Interference","Fading","Shadow mapping","Degradation","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","half-voting based twice-cooperative spectrum sensing scheme"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Half-Voting Based Twice-Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05304071.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304071","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304071","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is the key enabling technology for cognitive radio networks.

A thorough analysis of different antenna selection algorithms assorted from different exerting scenes is well developed.

Moreover, a decomposed joint TAS (transmit antenna selection) and RAS algorithm is introduced.

Since the reachable sum-rate is a long-term problem, we present an iterative approach to improve the power-offset and achieve a higher sum-rate than the ordinary scheme. Considering the difference between MIC and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system, we design joint precoding based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) by the Lagrangian multiplier method for the different transmitters, which is an iterative procedure to achieve the optimal structure. By setting a reasonable threshold for the iterative process, the effect of the crosstalk in MIC is removed significantly. Simulation results show the effectiveness of presented algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05304125.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative MMSE Precoding for MIMO Interference Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference channels","Microwave integrated circuits","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Iterative methods","Lagrangian functions","Transmitting antennas","Transceivers","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative MMSE precoding","MIMO interference channel","multi-input multi-output system","joint precoding","minimum mean square error","Lagrangian multiplier method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Iterative MMSE Precoding for MIMO Interference Channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5304125/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952755","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative MMSE Precoding for MIMO Interference Channel","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042938S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5304125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5304128,"authors":[{"name":"Yongqi Hao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yongqi","lastName":"Hao","id":"37667623500"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37350692600"},{"name":"Linsheng Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Linsheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37578531200"},{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406797800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5304128","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Energy consumption","Signal design","Handheld computers","Clocks","Frequency","Design optimization","Signal processing algorithms","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic power estimation methodology","FPGA-based digital signal processing systems","key design metric","clock frequency","sensitivity metric"]}],"abstract":"With increasing design complexity of portable handheld devices, decreasing system power and energy consumption has become a key design metric.

In order to reduce the computational complexity of motion estimation and maintain the performance of motion compensation, different search strategies are applied for the two types of block. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the computational complexity by about 49% compared with the Hexagon-Based Search (HEXBS) algorithm, while Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) loss is only 0.15 dB in average. Compared to the Diamond Search (DS) algorithm, the computational reduction is about 60%, while the performance loss is only 0.24 dB in average.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5304167","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05304167.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5304167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Motion Estimation Algorithm Using Spatial Correlation of Motion Vectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Motion Estimation Algorithm Using Spatial Correlation of Motion Vectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304167/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10956044","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5304167/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Motion Estimation Algorithm Using Spatial Correlation of Motion Vectors","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099101S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5304167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5304197,"authors":[{"name":"MengChao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Precision Machinery and Precision Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"MengChao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37676837800"},{"name":"YongXin Li","affiliation":["Department of Precision Machinery and Precision Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"YongXin","lastName":"Li","id":"37676384800"},{"name":"AnFang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Precision Machinery and Precision Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"AnFang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37673200500"},{"name":"ChangYu Han","affiliation":["Department of Precision Machinery and Precision Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"ChangYu","lastName":"Han","id":"37673049700"},{"name":"Chao Hu","affiliation":["Department of Precision Machinery and Precision Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Hu","id":"37677295200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5304197","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Machine vision","Robot vision systems","Cameras","Calibration","Artificial intelligence","Motion control","Flowcharts","Intelligent robots","Chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","cameras","computer vision","Hough transforms","image classification","image colour analysis","image segmentation","mobile robots","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time ROBOCUP vision system","RoboCup competition","high information contents","convenient implementation","human sights","small size league","color based robotic motion segmentation","camera calibration","circular Hough transformation"]}],"abstract":"In the RoboCup competition, vision system is regarded as of great importance with its high information contents, convenient implementation, and suitability for human sights of common and inexpensive hardware.

When the white space spectrums are not sufficient for all users, the grey space will be deployed for the non real-time services while a simple subcarrier selection method is adopted in order to limit the interference to the primary user and meet the BER need for transmission.

However, there exist two kinds of detection errors (i.e., miss-detection error and false-alarm error), which degrade the sensing performance severely. Aiming at minimizing the probability of total detection errors, based on the law of total probability we propose a novel target function (which also denotes the so-called comprehensive sensing performance metric) for optimization of sensing parameters. According to such established target function, we then apply the method of extremum seeking to develop the optimization of time-bandwidth product and sensing threshold jointly for local spectrum sensing with energy detection. Moreover, we further derive the closed-form expression of the optimal fusion rule for cooperative spectrum sensing by performing the discrete difference operation on the target function. Finally, the optimal area of joint parameters selection for local spectrum sensing and the effect of different detecting channel conditions on the optimization for cooperative spectrum sensing are evaluated numerically.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304220","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05304220.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304220","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Parameters for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Parameters for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304220/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5304220/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10953168","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Parameters for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-02-075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085461S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5304220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5304264,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Ma","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Ma","id":"37652194300"},{"name":"Sen Zhe Hu","affiliation":["Academy of Armored Forces Engineering, Beijing, China","Academy of Armorde Force Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sen Zhe","lastName":"Hu","id":"37653491600"},{"name":"Yan Cong Wang","affiliation":["PLA Communication and Command Institute, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yan Cong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085912649"},{"name":"Liang Zhu","affiliation":["PLA Communication Network Technology Management Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37653701800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5304264","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":878},"abstract":"Sharing of frequency spectrum between licensed primary users and unlicensed secondary users (SUs) requires reliable detection of spectrum occupancy by the SUs.

To improve the convergence of GA for Web service selection with global quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, chaos theory is introduced into GA with the relation matrix coding scheme. The chaotic law is based on the relation matrix coding scheme. During crossover process phase, chaotic time series are adopted instead of random ones. The effect of chaotic sequences and random ones is compared during several numerical tests. The performance of GA using chaotic time series and random ones is investigated.

However, tree based partition still does not code efficiently enough with video information, as it is unable to capture the geometric structure of 2D data. Concerned with this problem, this paper proposes a new motion compensation technique using polyline based block partition. A polyline, composed of two line segments, is used to approximate the curve contour of moving objects. By using polyline based partition, the accuracy of motion compensation can be improved and the prediction error can be reduced. Curvature analysis of object contour within macroblocks verified the validity of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the coding efficiency by 0.2-0.3 dB in PSNR, when compared to H.264/AVC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05304312.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5304312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5304312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Compensation Using Polyline Based Block Partition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Shape","Tree data structures","Automatic voltage control","Video coding","Optimization methods","PSNR","MPEG 4 Standard","Rate-distortion","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","curve fitting","motion compensation","object detection","tree data structures","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","macroblock partition","tree structure","video coding","2D data geometric structure","polyline","moving object curve contour approximation","H.264/AVC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Motion Compensation Using Polyline Based Block Partition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5304312/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955487","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Compensation Using Polyline Based Block Partition","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043193S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5304312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5304354,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37595917400"},{"name":"Xiaochuan Ma","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37405313400"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280194600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5304354","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Acoustic imaging","Frequency estimation","Robustness","Covariance matrix","Sensor arrays","Microphone arrays","Estimation error","Interference","Acoustic sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic imaging","array signal processing","image resolution","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband automatic diagonal-loading beamformers","acoustic imaging","data-independent delay-and-sum beamformer","ridge regression-based approach","shrinkage-based approach"]}],"abstract":"The data-independent delay-and-sum beamformer (DAS) is widely used for acoustic imaging applications, although it has lower resolution and worse interference rejection capability than the standard Capon beamformer (SCB).

As shown in the numerical examples, the proposed methods perform better to estimate the sound pressure level (SPL) of the signal of interest (SOI) for acoustic imaging applications in a small sample size than DAS and SCB.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5304354","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05304354.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5304354","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Automatic Diagonal-Loading Beamformers for Acoustic Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Automatic Diagonal-Loading Beamformers for Acoustic Imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304354/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5304354/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955632","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Automatic Diagonal-Loading Beamformers for Acoustic Imaging","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"02-44-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044733S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5304354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5304361,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin, Tianjin, CN"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37858740600"},{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin, Tianjin, CN"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"37675156600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5304361","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":454},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304361","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Lighting control","Field programmable gate arrays","Protocols","Resource management","Physical layer","Communication system control","Control systems","Sliding mode control","Ethernet networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control systems","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","light emitting diodes","network synthesis","protocols","reconfigurable architectures","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable LED illumination control system","FPGA","remote dynamic reconfiguration technique","field-programmable gate array","SMCS Ethernet PHY","physical layer transceiver","system hardware","Xilinx Virtex-IIXC2V30P FPGA","MicroBlaze","MAC IP core","network communication software","transmission control protocol","Internet protocol","light emitting diodes","lighting modes","FPGA resource utilization"]}],"abstract":"The dynamic reconfiguration technique based on FPGA (field-programmable gate array) can improve the resource utilization.

In the MIMO system, the non-linear precoding can archive the MIMO channel capacity through perfect feedback with a high complexity. To reduce the complexity, linear precoding with limited feedback information rate is used in most of simultaneous communication system.

This algorithm reduces the computational complexity substantially by maintaining the quality of the video almost same as that of the algorithms with fixed block size and fixed search range.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Search Range and Block Size in Block Matching Motion Estimation Algorithms in Video Coding","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5304388","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05304388.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5304388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Search Range and Block Size in Block Matching Motion Estimation Algorithms in Video Coding","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5304388/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955777","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Search Range and Block Size in Block Matching Motion Estimation Algorithms in Video Coding","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034805S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5304388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5304399,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochun Xie","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou, China","Center for Space Science and Applied Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Xie","id":"37085914804"},{"name":"Lingjuan Yu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lingjuan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085913336"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5304399","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video codecs","Compressed sensing","Decoding","Video compression","Sampling methods","Frequency","Physics","Equations","Code standards","Signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","decoding","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video codec","compressed sensing","encoding mode","high dimensional signal","low dimensional domain","decoder","H.264"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new video codec which combines a new compressed sensing theory and some critical ideas of traditional video codecs.

The expressions of correlation coefficient and MIMO-OFDM channel capacity are derived, respectively. The effect of spatial temporal correlation on the capacity is investigated for different physical parameters. Increasing delay spread taps and cluster angular spread can increase the capacity.

Besides these facts, the amount of the computation is less than the original ML-type synchronization algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05304582.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5304582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5304582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New OFDM Blind Synchronization Algorithm Suitable for PLC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Programmable control","Frequency synchronization","Attenuation","Fading","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency estimation","Costs","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power line communication","OFDM blind synchronization","multipath effect","carrier frequency offset","maximum likelihood estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New OFDM Blind Synchronization Algorithm Suitable for PLC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5304582/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955358","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New OFDM Blind Synchronization Algorithm Suitable for PLC","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"02-48-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06803S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5304582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5304583,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Fan","firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Fan","id":"37088102967"},{"name":"Fei Gao","firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37593140800"},{"name":"Yanming Xue","firstName":"Yanming","lastName":"Xue","id":"37085609843"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5304583","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","AWGN","Transmitters","OFDM modulation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Data communication","Wireless communication","Signal processing","Interference","Finite impulse response filter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","cyclic prefix","signal vector smoothness","channel transmission vector"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new blind channel estimation method for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

Compared with the maximum-likelihood estimation, simulation results illustrate the performance of MAP estimator achieve the CRB and the proposed algorithm can improve the efficiency of synchronization obviously, especially in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) environment.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304663","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05304663.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel MAP Estimation Algorithm for Multiple Frequency Offsets in Distributed MIMO System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304663/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel MAP Estimation Algorithm for Multiple Frequency Offsets in Distributed MIMO System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952428","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5304663/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel MAP Estimation Algorithm for Multiple Frequency Offsets in Distributed MIMO System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039881S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5304663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5304668,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599176300"},{"name":"Lin-rang Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lin-rang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280171200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5304668","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Ice","Error analysis","Decoding","Radar signal processing","Estimation error","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","channel estimation","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR loss","space-time block coded MIMO system","channel estimation error","symbol error rate","PSK modulation scheme","MIMO Rayleigh channel","receiver antennas"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304668","abstract":"Channel estimation error impacts the performance of practical orthogonal space-time block coded (OSTBC) MIMO system.

There are two deleterious effects caused by frequency offset; one is the reduction of signal amplitude in the output of the filters matched to each of the carriers and the second is introduction of intercarriers interference (ICI) from the other carriers which are now no longer orthogonal to the filter. lower bound of SNR fall caused by ICI has been obtained through numerical method. It is shown, and implemented by simulation, that to maintain signal-to-interference ratios of 20 dB or greater for the OFDM carriers, offset is limited to 15% or less of estimate frequency offset using an all phase estimator. Its performance computed and compared with the conventional OFDM simulation results. Since the ICI energy and signal energy both contribute coherently to the estimator, the algorithm generates extremely accurate estimates even when the offset is far too great to demodulate the data values.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304673","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05304673.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lower Bound of SNR Fall Caused by ICI Based on All Phase OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304673/","displayDocTitle":"Lower Bound of SNR Fall Caused by ICI Based on All Phase OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952509","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5304673/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower Bound of SNR Fall Caused by ICI Based on All Phase OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028973S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5304673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5304675,"authors":[{"name":"Melisa Barrera","affiliation":["Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia"],"firstName":"Melisa","lastName":"Barrera","id":"37541904800"},{"name":"Leonardo Betancur","affiliation":["Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Medellin, Colombia"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Betancur","id":"37542858500"},{"name":"Andres Navarro","affiliation":["Universidad de Icesi, Cali, Colombia"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Navarro","id":"37269048500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4387-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4388-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2330-989X"}],"articleNumber":"5304675","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband communication","Signal to noise ratio","Algorithm design and analysis","Communication switching","Equations","Programmable control","Adaptive control","OFDM modulation","Channel estimation","Quality control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","channel estimation","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR estimation","MB-OFDM ultra wide band communication","signal to noise ratio algorithm","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","switched estimator","adaptive modulation","channel estimation","link quality control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MB OFDM","SNR estimation","UWB"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel signal to noise ratio algorithm based on the moments of the received signal.

The algorithm outlined in this paper allows for complete BIST of the receiver, from the Intermediate Frequency (IF) to the output data stream. We focus on implementational details which are of most interest to contemporary wireless communications systems, namely on providing solutions for the following system attributes: (1) all-digital software radio receivers; (2) fixed-point implementation; (3) hardware implementations; (4) applications for BIST in satellite, cellular, mobile, and low-power applications. While the problem of generating bandpass Gaussian noise is related to generation of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), it is shown that to generate bandpass Gaussian noise samples for all-digital receivers it is necessary to generate non-white correlated noise. As an additional complication, fixed-point representation of this noise must address dynamic range considerations to avoid saturation and underflow. We present a method by which bandpass Gaussian noise can be generated and incorporated with ease within BIST circuits in contemporary receivers while conforming to any low-power, fixed-point, and small form-factor constraints that apply to the receiver as a whole.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304722","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289117/5304383/05304722.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5304383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5304722","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5304722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Generation of bandpass Gaussian noise with applications to complete Built In Self Test in wireless communications receivers","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5304722/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957596","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of bandpass Gaussian noise with applications to complete Built In Self Test in wireless communications receivers","confLoc":"Medellin, Colombia","sourcePdf":"1801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057563S","chronDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289117","isNumber":"5304383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289117","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5304383","articleId":"5304722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5304727,"authors":[{"name":"Gerardo A.

Computer simulations demonstrate the validity of the approach.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5304735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05304735.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive-Adaptive Beamforming Algorithm with Nulls Widening","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5304735/","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive-Adaptive Beamforming Algorithm with Nulls Widening","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10955938","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive-Adaptive Beamforming Algorithm with Nulls Widening","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"02-35-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094249S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5304735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5304737,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Adnan","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Adnan","id":"37089147581"},{"name":"Haoqiu She","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haoqiu","lastName":"She","id":"37683144600"},{"name":"Yafeng Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yafeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407536800"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37281508500"},{"name":"Wei Xiang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Surveying, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37396484300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4387-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4388-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2330-989X"}],"articleNumber":"5304737","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304737","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless sensor networks","Diversity reception","Decoding","Antenna arrays","Next generation networking","Wireless networks","Maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multicast communication","radio repeaters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward relay","2-hop networks","multihop networks","multicast relay","intermediate nodes","relay nodes","virtual MIMO relay scheme","MATLAB simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2-hop network","virtual MIMO","dual AF relay","multicasting"]}],"abstract":"The use of multicasting over multi-hop networks seems an attractive new way to provide support to real-time applications like video streaming.

The harmonic nested array is composed of several uniformly-spaced linear subarrays, each of which processes an octave subband signal respectively. These nonuniform subband signals are implemented by general parameter filter banks. Each subarray beamforming is carried out by space-frequency signal processing approach, and the number of weights of each subarray is determined by the total frequency bandwidth of its entire subbands correspondingly. This processing architecture based beamformer splits the wideband signal into several narrow subband ones which are processed in parallel, and each subarray is operating with the lowest rate, which contributes to decreasing the computational load significantly and improving the speed and performances as well. Simulations show that the proposed beamformer is competent for constant beamwidth beamforming with much lower computation complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304805","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05304805.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304805","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multirate Method for Constant Beamwidth Beamforming of Nested Array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multirate Method for Constant Beamwidth Beamforming of Nested Array","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304805/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5304805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10953096","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multirate Method for Constant Beamwidth Beamforming of Nested Array","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-02-028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055147S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5304805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5304806,"authors":[{"name":"Gonzalo Olmedo Cifuentes","affiliation":["Celso de Almeida, Departamnto d El\u00e9ctica y Electr\u00f3nica, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica del Ej\u00e9rcito, Ecuador, Faculdade de Engenharia El\u00e9trica e de Coputa\u00e7\u00e3o, State University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Gonzalo Olmedo","lastName":"Cifuentes","id":"37299803700"},{"name":"Victor Proano","affiliation":["Celso de Almeida, Departamnto d El\u00e9ctica y Electr\u00f3nica, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica del Ej\u00e9rcito, Ecuador, Faculdade de Engenharia El\u00e9trica e de Coputa\u00e7\u00e3o, State University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Proano","id":"37680313100"},{"name":"Celso de Almeida","affiliation":["Celso de Almeida, Departamnto d El\u00e9ctica y Electr\u00f3nica, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica del Ej\u00e9rcito, Ecuador, Faculdade de Engenharia El\u00e9trica e de Coputa\u00e7\u00e3o, State University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Celso","lastName":"de Almeida","id":"37299799300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4387-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4388-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2330-989X"}],"articleNumber":"5304806","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Multiaccess communication","Frequency-selective fading channels","Linear matrix inequalities","Decorrelation","Multiple access interference","Multiuser detection","Rayleigh channels","RAKE receivers","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","fading channels","linear matrix inequalities","multiuser detection","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detector","synchronous direct sequence code division multiple access","frequency-selective fading channels","linear matrix inequalities","Rake decorrelating detector","bit error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DS-CDMA","Multiuser Detection","LMI","MUD","RAKE","RDD","Frequency-Selective Channel"]}],"abstract":"In this article a multiuser receivers for DS-CDMA frequency-selective fading channels using linear matrix inequalities (LMI) is proposed.

Since LTE and WIMAX as 4G systems have both adopted OFDM as the preferred physical technology for better spectrum efficiency, the RF parts of those systems have to face major challenges. Hence the extensively applied error vector magnitude (EVM) can be used as an effective and efficient method to evaluate the RF performance of those digitally modulated communication systems. Considering an optimal subcarrier allocation in OFDM-based systems Spectrum Flatness is an important quality characteristic, which has been rarely examined in the past. In comparison, effects on EVM, related simulations and measurements have been sufficiently analyzed in the past. But particularly the correlation between EVM and Spectrum Flatness has not been taken into account so far. In this paper we are discussing EVM measurement accuracy and furthermore the influence of sliding window algorithms on the EVM since those are used in LTE systems. On the other hand we will show that only using sliding window algorithms does not make spectrum flatness measurements, as standardized in WiMAX, dispansable in order to promote the decision process. For this purpose an accurate, robust EVM measurement algorithm, simulation, application and results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304872","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05304872.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Vector Magnitude Measurement Accuracy and Impact on Spectrum Flatness Behavior for OFDM-Based WiMAX and LTE Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304872/","displayDocTitle":"Error Vector Magnitude Measurement Accuracy and Impact on Spectrum Flatness Behavior for OFDM-Based WiMAX and LTE Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952096","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5304872/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Vector Magnitude Measurement Accuracy and Impact on Spectrum Flatness Behavior for OFDM-Based WiMAX and LTE Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042824S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5304872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5304907,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37399238800"},{"name":"Zhijun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Li","id":"37404748200"},{"name":"Miao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37403094900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5304907","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Receivers","Source separation","Signal processing algorithms","Analytical models","Convergence","Local oscillators","Baseband","Sun","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","compensation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IQ imbalance compensation","in-phase-and-quadrature phase","simplified blind source separation method","signal processing","radio receiver","digital communication","spectrum monitoring","EASI","equivariant adaptive separation independence algorithm"]}],"abstract":"I/Q signal processing is widely used in radio receivers such as zero-IF and low-IF receivers for digital communications and spectrum monitoring and so on. However, all of these receivers share the common problem of the imbalance (or mismatch) on the amplitude and phases of the I and Q branches, which is unavoidable in the analog front-end of those receivers. In this paper, we propose a simplified blind source separation method based on the famous EASI algorithm and apply it to the compensation of I/Q imbalance. Performance of the proposed method is simulated and analyzed. The results show that it has stable tracking ability and satisfactory convergence speed.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304907","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05304907.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5304907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of IQ Imbalance Based on a Simplified Blind Source Separation Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of IQ Imbalance Based on a Simplified Blind Source Separation Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304907/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952346","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5304907/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of IQ Imbalance Based on a Simplified Blind Source Separation Method","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-02-032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062476S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5304907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5304954,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Ricardo Casallas","affiliation":["Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s, Tunja, Colombia"],"firstName":"Jose Ricardo","lastName":"Casallas","id":"37667402100"},{"name":"Nestor Pena Traslavina","affiliation":["Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia"],"firstName":"Nestor Pena","lastName":"Traslavina","id":"37680189400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4387-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4388-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2330-989X"}],"articleNumber":"5304954","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":580},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5304954","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Radio frequency","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Operational amplifiers","Transmission lines","High power amplifiers","Mobile handsets","Personal digital assistants","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave power amplifiers","power transmission lines","radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear Class-E RF power amplifier","Class-F RF power amplifier","microwave power amplifier","transmission lines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifier Design","RF.

In this paper, we present a methodology for designing and building no-lineal microwave and RF power amplifiers. To build the amplifiers we propose the use of transmission-lines, that facilitate the practical implementation because of the low availability of a wide range of lumped elements in the market but they can be replaced by transmission-lines.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5304383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5304954","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289117/5304383/05304954.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5304954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and test of nonlinear Class-E and Class-F RF power amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and test of nonlinear Class-E and Class-F RF power amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5304954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957587","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5304954/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and test of nonlinear Class-E and Class-F RF power amplifiers","confLoc":"Medellin, Colombia","sourcePdf":"1202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045767S","chronDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289117","isNumber":"5304383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289117","xplore-issue":"5304383","articleId":"5304954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5304958,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiming Yu","firstName":"Zhiming","lastName":"Yu","id":"37088194549"},{"name":"Lili Guo","firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Guo","id":"37288444200"},{"name":"Lin Qi","firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Qi","id":"37086007570"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5304958","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Multiaccess communication","Gaussian noise","Background noise","Signal analysis","Binary phase shift keying","Quadrature phase shift keying","Signal detection","Algorithm design and analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind estimation","multicarrier CDMA subcarrier frequencies","high-order cyclic cumulants","BPSK-QPSK modulation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposed a method to estimate sub-carriers frequencies of multi-carrier CDMA signals utilizing higher-order cyclic cumulants, based on the cyclic stationary characteristic of multi-carrier CDMA signals.

Therefore, the available spectrum for different transmitter-receiver pairs is distinct due to their location difference and so on. To satisfy different traffic demand and improve system performance, an adaptive unbalanced spectrum usage scheme is proposed. Moreover, to obtain the system maximum throughput, the optimal power allocation problem is formulated under the total power constraint based on the presented spectrum usage scheme.

Given the nonlinear dependency of the channel parameters on the received signals in multiuser/multipath scenarios, we show that the SPKF achieves better performance than its linear counterparts. This derivative-free Kalman filtering approach, avoids the errors associated with linearization in the conventional extended Kalman filter (EKF). The simulation results also demonstrates that the proposed SPKF algorithms are simpler to implement, and more resilient to near-far interference in CDMA networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305051.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Derivative Based and Derivative Free Kalman Filters for Multipath Channel Estimation in CDMA Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multipath channels","Multiaccess communication","Delay estimation","Parameter estimation","Delay effects","Fading","Multiple access interference","Filtering","Tracking loops","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","fading channels","Kalman filters","multipath channels","multiuser channels","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["derivative based Kalman filter","derivative free Kalman filters","multipath channel gain estimation","multipath fading CDMA network","time delay estimation","code division multiple access","multiuser scenario","near-far interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Derivative Based and Derivative Free Kalman Filters for Multipath Channel Estimation in CDMA Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305051/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10953010","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Derivative Based and Derivative Free Kalman Filters for Multipath Channel Estimation in CDMA Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-02-015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039127S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5305051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5305066,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxin Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Northern Fiberhome Technologies Company, Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406504000"},{"name":"Jianguo Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Yu","id":"37404162700"},{"name":"Zhi Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37674350500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5305066","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":655},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predistortion","OFDM","Broadband amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Least squares approximation","Resonance light scattering","Polynomials","Adaptive filters","Digital filters","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","digital filters","OFDM modulation","polynomials","power amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband OFDM power amplifier","training sequence","polynomial","adaptive digital predistortion filter","MATLAB software"]}],"abstract":"A adaptive digital predistortion hybrid algorithm of LMS and RLS based on training sequence is proposed, which is applied to a digital pre-distortion system based on polynomial.

The proposed solution consists of a SVM classifier that uses as input parameters the distance between the received symbol and its nearest neighbor in each constellation. The results obtained by the proposed classifier is compared to a state-of-art technique. The comparison show a good performance for the 16-QAM, 32-QAM and 64-QAM modulation schemes. In the second approach, the cyclic spectral analysis is adopted as the method for extracting the signals features, and the SVM classifier is used for the pattern recognition stage. The proposed method achieved excellent results for the AM, BPSK, QPSK and BFSK modulation schemes. In both approaches, different scenarios are evaluated which may serve as a starting point for researchers who want to compare results systematically.","doi":"10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5305130","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289117/5304383/05305130.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5304383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5305130","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic modulation classification for cognitive radio systems: Results for the symbol and waveform domains","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automatic modulation classification for cognitive radio systems: Results for the symbol and waveform domains","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305130/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305130/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957560","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic modulation classification for cognitive radio systems: Results for the symbol and waveform domains","confLoc":"Medellin, Colombia","sourcePdf":"0404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06216S","chronDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289117","isNumber":"5304383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289117","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5304383","articleId":"5305130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5305134,"authors":[{"name":"Dzmitry Kliazovich","affiliation":["DISI University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Dzmitry","lastName":"Kliazovich","id":"37283713000"},{"name":"Jorge Lima","affiliation":["Institute of Computing, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Lima","id":"37674154900"},{"name":"Nelson L.

In DF (decode and forward) scheme, an equivalent transmit rate formulation is developed, optimal power allocation is obtained by linear optimization and Lagrange multiplier method. By using this optimal power allocation, an efficient heuristic subcarrier pairing algorithm is proposed, the joint allocation of them is presented to further improve capacity.

Apparently, improved implant accuracy can not only improve the local control but also reduce global toxicity. As a part of on going efforts to develop robot assisted brachytherapy, the current investigation focuses on dynamic trajectory planning of the brachytherapy needle. Toward that goal, a 3D planning algorithm based on artificial potential field, non-linear material model and dynamic finite element method is proposed. The whole insertion process has been discretized into several time steps. Using compartment trajectory planning in each time step constantly, the dynamic trajectory planning can be conducted smoothly. A numerical simulation has been done to prove the algorithm validity. The result shows that the needle can reach the target without touching the obstacle.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and

By maximizing the noncircularity rate of the output signal, this new second-order blind beamformer can directly extract the signal of interest from circular interferences and noise (both are not necessarily Gaussian) without training signal and array calibration. This NORM approach can be implemented in a completely closed form and is shown to be attractive than the customary high-order statistics (HOS) strategy for blind noncircular signal extraction in terms of computation burdens and output signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10952271","htmlLink":"/document/5305182/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Noncircularity-Rate Maximization: A New Approach to Adaptive Blind Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncircularity-Rate Maximization: A New Approach to Adaptive Blind Beamforming","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-02-011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050664S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5305182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5305188,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoguo Zhou","affiliation":["School of Naval Architecture & Ocean Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoguo","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37656692700"},{"name":"Shuguang Luan","affiliation":["School of Civil Engineering, Dalian Fisheries University, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Shuguang","lastName":"Luan","id":"37585949000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5305188","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305188","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joining processes","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Oceans","Marine technology","Mathematical model","Reflection","Civil engineering","Aquaculture","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","ocean waves","offshore installations","structural engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wave impact force prediction","shore connecting structure","BP neural network","wave style","wave period","incident wave height","wharf deck","coast engineering","offshore engineering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305188","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305188.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on Wave Impact Force Prediction of Different Shore Connecting Structure Based on Improved BP Neural Network","abstract":"In this paper, the advanced neural network technology was introduced to the field of the wave impact force prediction.

That is because in MIMO uplink transmission systems, different mobile nodes use different oscillators (even with different Doppler Shifts), each introducing one unique carrier frequency offset. In addition, more than one transmit antenna may be equipped in one mobile node. If different training sequences (TS) are transmitted at different transmit antennas, self-interference appears. This kind of self-interference makes carrier frequency offset estimation even more complicated. In a multi-user environment with full-multiplexing transmission mode, when performing uplink synchronization, training sequences transmitted by different users may overlap with each other at the receiver (base station). Co-Channel Interference may also result in some overlap of training sequences when performing uplink synchronization. This kind of overlap may degrade the estimation performance or even cause some estimators' failure. How to mitigate the overlap distortion is critical in MIMO uplink synchronization. This paper first analyzed the inter-TS-interference in MIMO uplink synchronization. For an unbiased carrier frequency offset estimator, its Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is also derived. Two Lemmas without proof are also provided for MIMO uplink synchronization. With received Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) known at the receiver, a joint carrier frequency offset estimator, named as Joint Best Linear Estimator (JBLUE), is also proposed. Simulation results prove that a great performance improvement with regard to estimation accuracy can be expected by using JBLUE when performing MIMO uplink synchronization.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305200","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305200.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Uplink Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation in MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305200/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Uplink Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation in MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952347","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305200/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Uplink Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation in MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071667S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5305200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5305206,"authors":[{"name":"Liangrui Tang","firstName":"Liangrui","lastName":"Tang","id":"37591636800"},{"name":"Qi Zuo","firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37087650702"},{"name":"Yi Sun","firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37089087678"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5305206","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Frequency synchronization","Chaotic communication","Frequency estimation","Space technology","Transmitting antennas","Signal processing algorithms","Bandwidth","Timing","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM synchronization algorithm","three-dimensional chaotic system","synchronization training sequences","communication system security","timing offset estimation","frequency offset estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305206","abstract":"As the existing MIMO-OFDM synchronization algorithms have the disadvantage of weak practicality and low bandwidth efficiency, a novel synchronization algorithm based on three-dimensional chaotic system is presented in this paper.

Simulation results show that the algorithm has the higher accuracy of the timing offset estimation and the better performance of frequency offset estimation.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305206","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305206.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-OFDM Synchronization Algorithm Based on Three-Dimensional Chaotic System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-OFDM Synchronization Algorithm Based on Three-Dimensional Chaotic System","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305206/","accessionNumber":"10952348","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305206/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-OFDM Synchronization Algorithm Based on Three-Dimensional Chaotic System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03878S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5305206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5305235,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280019900"},{"name":"Hongbin Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37697285000"},{"name":"Minsi Yao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Minsi","lastName":"Yao","id":"37602088200"},{"name":"Yun Niu","affiliation":["Tianjin Cancer Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Niu","id":"37085914566"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4132-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4134-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5305235","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Breast tissue","Neural networks","Electrodes","Bioelectric phenomena","Impedance measurement","Pain","Breast cancer","Mammary glands","Hardware","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","bioelectric phenomena","biological tissues","biomedical electrodes","cancer","electric impedance imaging","medical signal processing","neural nets","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intraoperative breast tissue distinction","neural network integration","bioelectrical impedance measurement","partial mastectomy","electrical properties","breast cancer","normal breast tissues","mammary gland","adipose","arc-shaped electrode","frequency-resistance curves","BP neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305235","abstract":"Bioelectrical impedance measurement technology used in intra-operative breast tissues distinction can shorten the waiting time and lighten patients' pain in partial mastectomy.

Partially decoded Wyner-Ziv (WZ) frames, based on initial SI by motion compensation temporal interpolation (MCTI), are exploited to improve the performance of the whole SI generation. In addition, an algorithm use to estimate, at the decoder, the correlation or error distribution between the original and the side information frames.

The influence of absorption and turbulence can in some cases be significantly reduced by an appropriate design of free space optics (FSO) systems. Thus, in a typical continental area, where rain, snow or fog occur, scattering is the most important phenomenon causing power losses. Attenuation due to scattering can be expressed as a function of the link distance, wavelength and meteorological visibility. The paper deals with the estimation of FSO availability based on statistical evaluation of visibility data collected at several airports in Europe. The availability is evaluated in dependence on link distance, wavelength and power link margin.","doi":"10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5305266","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289117/5304383/05305266.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5305266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5304383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of free space optics systems availability based on meteorological visibility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305266/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of free space optics systems availability based on meteorological visibility","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957592","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305266/","conferenceDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of free space optics systems availability based on meteorological visibility","confLoc":"Medellin, Colombia","sourcePdf":"0102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043245S","chronDate":"10-11 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289117","isNumber":"5304383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289117","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5304383","articleId":"5305266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5305276,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Specifically, the phase vectors are applied in weighting the subblocks and two main design principles of the set of optimized phase vectors (OPV) are introduced.

A fabricated six-channel board for intracortical activities recording using commercial components measures 4.0 cm times 8.5 cm, weighs 83 g, consumes up to 24.5 mW, and estimates 1.3 U Vrms input-referred noise, with the gain of 39.4 dB. The material of entire six-channel preamplifier costs less than 24.5 United States dollars. The preamplifier has been successfully utilized in vivo to process cortically derived extracellular evoked potentials under anesthetized rat. Results from both simulated circuit testing and practical animal measuring indicate that a high-quality recording can be obtained by adopting the presented circuits. The proposed preamplifier can be easily expanded by combining other post-processing circuits or recording devices. This preamplifier can also be flexibly modified and applied to other related electrophysiological or physiological studies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Preamplifiers","Operational amplifiers","Voltage","Gain measurement","Noise measurement","Circuit noise","Costs","In vivo","Extracellular","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical measurement","brain","cellular biophysics","neurophysiology","preamplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["portable preamplifier","multichannel intracortical recordings","commercial components","offset voltage reduction","active guarding circuit","selectable reference node","grounded plate arrangement","intracortical activity","extracellular evoked potentials","anesthetized rat","electrophysiological study","physiological study","operational amplifier selection","input-referred noise","mass 83 g"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2009.5305298","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5301643/5301644/05305298.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5301644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2009.5305298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple and Portable Preamplifier for Multichannel Intracortical Recordings Using Commercial Components","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Simple and Portable Preamplifier for Multichannel Intracortical Recordings Using Commercial Components","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305298/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305298/","accessionNumber":"10956591","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple and Portable Preamplifier for Multichannel Intracortical Recordings Using Commercial Components","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-07-005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055676S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5301643","isNumber":"5301644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5301643","xplore-issue":"5301644","articleId":"5305298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5305329,"authors":[{"name":"Peizhong Xie","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Peizhong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37683939400"},{"name":"Baoyu Zheng","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Baoyu","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37272833700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5305329","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Antenna feeds","Scheduling algorithm","Throughput","Downlink","Slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel capacity","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-feedback scheduling scheme","MU-MIMO","multiuser scheduling scheme","MIMO channel","transmit antenna","base station","channel allocation","channel capacity performance"]}],"abstract":"An improved multiuser scheduling scheme which can reduce feedback load and preserve most of the capacity performance in MIMO channels is proposed in this paper.

We assume that the CSI is fed back to the base station (BS) through a delayed channel. To avoid the system degradation caused by the outdated CSI, we present a channel prediction scheme at the user side, which takes the delay time into account. Then, under the assumption of the erasure coding, we formulate the optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum rate of the multicast service conditioned on the predicted channel gains, subject to total transmit power and average bit error ratio (BER) constraints. To reduce the time complexity, we propose a two-step suboptimal algorithm that separates subcarrier allocation and power allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has much less average BER violation than the algorithm where no prediction is performed; for short feedback delay, the performance of the proposed algorithm is close to the perfect CSI one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Resource Allocation for Multicast OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305335","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305335.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Resource Allocation for Multicast OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305335/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952935","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Resource Allocation for Multicast OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056046S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5305335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5305341,"authors":[{"name":"Haiquan Wang","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092800"},{"name":"Zhijin Zhao","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhijin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279725500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5305341","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","MIMO","Feedback","Array signal processing","Operating systems","Error probability","Educational institutions","Analytical models","Receiving antennas","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","finite-bit feedback","maximum-likehood decoding","asymptotic optimal operating system","encoding algorithm"]}],"abstract":"A MIMO system with finite-bit feedback based on fixed constellations is considered.

The sum of square of errors between the network outputs and constant vector is taken as performance index. The weight matrix between the input layer and hidden layer is tuned in the light of gradient descend method and can be achieved stable value while the performance index is reached to expected value, while two elements of weight matrix between hidden and output layer are coordinates of projected points in image plane and keep constant during the training. Thus projection matrix of cameras can be obtained from the weights between input layer and hidden layer of the neural network, and calibration of system is finished. Finally, the precision analysis is carried out for machine vision system.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2009.5305383","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300806/5300807/05305383.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2009.5305383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Camera Calibration and Precision Analysis Based on BP Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Camera Calibration and Precision Analysis Based on BP Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10956245","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5305383/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Camera Calibration and Precision Analysis Based on BP Neural Network","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-16-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048371S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300806","isNumber":"5300807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300806","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5300807","articleId":"5305383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5305400,"authors":[{"name":"Qun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404134600"},{"name":"Zhi Wen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhi Wen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289191900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4132-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4134-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5305400","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"abstract":"The pulse waveform characteristic point detection is important for non-invasively detecting cardiovascular parameters. A novel designed algorithm based on wavelet transform (WT) is developed. For some pulse waveforms, characteristic points exactly correspond to the zero-crossing of a wavelet with one vanishing moment, while the others incompletely correspond to. And characteristic points also correspond to the local extrema of a wavelet with two vanishing moment. So an algorithm combining a wavelet with one vanishing moment and another one with two vanishing moment is used to improve the detection rate of characteristic points. The results show that automatic identification of characteristics points has a high rate of accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5301643/5301644/05305400.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2009.5305400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2009.5305400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5301644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of the Pulse Waveform Characteristic Points by Wavelet Transform Using Multiscale Differential Operator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Cardiology","Filter bank","Cutoff frequency","Logic","Band pass filters","Algorithm design and analysis","Wavelet analysis","Risk analysis","Cardiovascular diseases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiovascular system","medical signal detection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse waveform characteristic points detection","wavelet transform","multiscale differential operator","cardiovascular parameters","vanishing moment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detection of the Pulse Waveform Characteristic Points by Wavelet Transform Using Multiscale Differential Operator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305400/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10956746","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of the Pulse Waveform Characteristic Points by Wavelet Transform Using Multiscale Differential Operator","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048363S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5301643","isNumber":"5301644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5301643","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5301644","articleId":"5305400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5305407,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoshuan Yang","affiliation":["EMP Laboratory, PLA Univ. of Sci. &Tech., Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoshuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085913369"},{"name":"Chen Bin","affiliation":["EMP Laboratory, PLA Univ. of Sci. &Tech., Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Chen Bin","id":"37086892095"},{"name":"Zhou Bihua","affiliation":["EMP Laboratory, PLA Univ. of Sci. &Tech., Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Zhou Bihua","id":"37086890641"},{"name":"Xiong Run","affiliation":["EMP Laboratory, PLA Univ. of Sci. &Tech., Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiong Run","id":"37086895220"},{"name":"Yin Qin","affiliation":["EMP Laboratory, PLA Univ. of Sci. &Tech., Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yin Qin","id":"37086889689"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4344-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5305407","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"abstract":"To simulate the EMP propagation in large-scale and long-distances vaulted tunnel, an effective MW-FDTD method based on parallel computing was presented.

In the process of coherent demodulation of Rake receiver, the carrier phase synchronization of multipath radio frequency (RF) components with local recovery carrier is inherently needed. However, in general RAKE receiver, it is only realized between main path component and local recovery carrier. For other secondary multipath components, there are random phase differences caused by time delay. So the demodulation of secondary path RF components is non-coherent demodulation and a RF loss factors will be introduced into the demodulation signals, which have a seriously effect on the performance of traditional RAKE receiver and may even cause its failure. Based on the analysis, a RF loss factor elimination method is proposed, which can estimate the phase difference of each multipath component from main path component as well as the instantaneous track of the changes of phase and make the perfectly multipath coherent demodulation possible. With using the method, two feasible Rake receiver implement schemes are presented lastly, which are multipath coherent demodulation RF implement scheme and multipath non-coherent demodulation baseband implement scheme respective. The performance analyses show that the proposed schemes are feasible.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305437","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305437.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on the Improvement Scheme of RAKE Receiver for CDMA Downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study on the Improvement Scheme of RAKE Receiver for CDMA Downlink","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305437/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5305437/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on the Improvement Scheme of RAKE Receiver for CDMA Downlink","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080289S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5305437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5305449,"authors":[{"name":"Weiwen Weng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weiwen","lastName":"Weng","id":"37665625300"},{"name":"Yuan'an Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan'an","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279411900"},{"name":"Hefei Hu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hefei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37279398400"},{"name":"Dongming Yuan","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongming","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37534930700"},{"name":"Xianglin Zhu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xianglin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37597524900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5305449","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Radiofrequency interference","Quadrature phase shift keying","Interference cancellation","OFDM","Attenuation","Wireless sensor networks","Binary phase shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","minimum shift keying","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM-MSK modulation scheme","MB-OFDM UWB systems","cognitive radio","minimum-shift keying","roll-off sidelobe spectrum","multi-carrier modulation systems","out-of-band attenuation"]}],"abstract":"Minimum-shift keying (MSK) has a fast roll-off sidelobe spectrum, which is an excellent property for multi-carrier modulation (MCM) systems.

Radio Spectrum security is now attached with great importance. Real time spectrum anomalies detection is vital for increasing demand on security to ensure that wireless services function on the rails. Malicious radio events, such as illegal channel occupation, happened frequently in the recent years, which result in severe interference to the normal radio spectrum usage. There were anomalies detection approaches in different areas proposed to conquer such malicious events. However, those malicious events usually happen in a short interval, this increases the demand on instantaneous responds for real-time events, and the complexity of previous approaches makes them insufficient to handle the real time task. In this paper, a new approach for anomalies detection in spectrum monitoring is proposed. Distinct from previous anomalies detection methods, both temporal and spectral information are taken into account and utilized to find out the potential anomalies. Meanwhile, an adaptive learning ability is proposed along to respond to the real-time change of radio environment. To analyze spectrum measurement data with high dimension, Mahalanobis distance is applied to disclose potential anomalies according to the historical pattern of radio spectrum. Methodology analysis and real case study have been performed to validate the detection effectiveness in practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305462.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal-Spectral Data Mining in Anomaly Detection for Spectrum Monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Monitoring","Communication system security","Data security","Rails","Interference","Event detection","Data analysis","Pattern analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio spectrum management","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal-spectral data mining","spectrum monitoring","wireless services","radio spectrum security","real time spectrum anomaly detection","malicious radio event","illegal channel occupation","radio spectrum usage","spectral information","adaptive learning ability","radio environment","spectrum measurement data analysis","Mahalanobis distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Temporal-Spectral Data Mining in Anomaly Detection for Spectrum Monitoring","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305462/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952192","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal-Spectral Data Mining in Anomaly Detection for Spectrum Monitoring","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"06-05-017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042165S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5305462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5305472,"authors":[{"name":"Lidong Wang","affiliation":["Liaoning University of Science and Technology, Anshan, China"],"firstName":"Lidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406758500"},{"name":"Yonghui Yang","affiliation":["Liaoning University of Science and Technology, Anshan, China"],"firstName":"Yonghui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37677338700"},{"name":"Tao Chi","affiliation":["Liaoning University of Science and Technology, Anshan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Chi","id":"37392509900"},{"name":"Xuebo Chen","affiliation":["Liaoning University of Science and Technology, Anshan, China"],"firstName":"Xuebo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278213400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5305472","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a space time block coded (STBC) MIMO-OFDM scheme for indoor UWB using whose channel is frequency selective because of full of multipaths.

But the process of its bit allocation will cause high complexity and bad real-time to build a power-increment table. In this paper, a low-complexity multi-user subcarrier-bit-power allocation algorithm for wireless OFDMA system is proposed. In this new algorithm, the subcarriers are allocated to the user who has the best channel quality. As a result, channel capacity, based on multi-user frequency division, is improved through subcarrier allocation. At the same time, power allocation is advanced based on channel-loss-compensation. The result of simulation shows that the new algorithm's complexity is lower than Parteek Bansal's, and the BER is improved in the same SNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305523.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Adaptive Subcarrier-Bit-Power Allocation for OFDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","OFDM","Communications technology","Resource management","System performance","Channel capacity","Frequency conversion","Downlink","Transmitters","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive multiuser subcarrier-bit-power allocation","wireless OFDMA system","resources allocation","bit error rate","BER","channel capacity","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Research on Adaptive Subcarrier-Bit-Power Allocation for OFDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305523/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952430","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Adaptive Subcarrier-Bit-Power Allocation for OFDMA","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073448S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5305523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5305529,"authors":[{"name":"Caidan Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Caidan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37396944800"},{"name":"Wumei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Wumei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406407100"},{"name":"Lianfen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Lianfen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37405928400"},{"name":"Yan Yao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Yao","id":"37275326300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5305529","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305529","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","Fingerprint recognition","Cognitive radio","Information security","Chromium","Emulation","Phase noise","Physical layer","Phase modulation","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anti-PUE attack base","transmitter fingerprint identification","cognitive radio","information security"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305529","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305529.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anti-PUE Attack Base on the Transmitter Fingerprint Identification in Cognitive Radio","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is regarded as one of the best options to solve the problem of low spectrum utilization.

Extensive simulations show that for different propagation scenarios and transfer rates, detectors based on NN composite pulse-multipath channel estimation outperform traditional correlator-based detector.","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305541.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite Pulse-Multipath Channel Estimation for IR-UWB Communication System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Composite Pulse-Multipath Channel Estimation for IR-UWB Communication System","htmlLink":"/document/5305541/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10952514","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite Pulse-Multipath Channel Estimation for IR-UWB Communication System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-01-012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056497S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5305541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5305570,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Ma","id":"37657257000"},{"name":"Hua Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Yu","id":"37289439200"},{"name":"Shouyin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shouyin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280148500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3691-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3693-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3692-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5305570","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2005},"abstract":"The minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation has well performance but higher complexity than least-square (LS) channel estimation, specially it requires the channel statistical properties including the channel autocorrelation matrix and the noise variance.

The simulation results show that antenna selection of transmitter can increase the channel capacity of MIMO system by 1 bit/s in a flat fading environment with a rank deficient channel.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305757","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5300798/5300799/05305757.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2009.5305757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection Strategies in Correlated Fading MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305757/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection Strategies in Correlated Fading MIMO Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10952104","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5305757/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Antenna Selection Strategies in Correlated Fading MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049455S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5300798","isNumber":"5300799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5300798","xplore-issue":"5300799","articleId":"5305757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5305774,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Xu","firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086722790"},{"name":"Fei Zhao","firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37069420500"},{"name":"Yongbin Xu","firstName":"Yongbin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37087735128"},{"name":"Yu Guan","firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Guan","id":"38252061300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4131-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5305774","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chip scale packaging","Rail to rail operation","Operational amplifiers","Rail to rail amplifiers","Voltage","Demodulation","Noise reduction","Rail to rail inputs","Differential amplifiers","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip design","chopper-stabilized rail-to-rail operational amplifier","chopper-wave modulation","chopper-wave demodulation","current 22 muA","frequency 1 kHz","power 0.5 W"]}],"abstract":"A novel chip design of chopper-stabilized operational amplifier is presented, chopper-wave modulation and demodulation is used in the architecture, and its \\lj noise is reduced remarkably.

In this paper, a new system structure is proposed for PLC, which is based on distributed orthogonal frequency division multiple access (DOFDMA). Subcarrier sensing, i.e., sensing every OFDM subcarrier to see if it is occupied or not, is proposed to replace the conventional carrier sensing multiple access (CSMA) for multi-user contention of a channel. This structure, borrowed from cognitive radio, allows multiple users to opportunistically share the same channel on different subcarriers and therefore increases the channel capacity. Two subcarrier sensing methods are proposed: one is based on information theory and the other is based on successive energy comparison. Simulations are provided to verify the methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5305940","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05305940.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5305940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/05305940.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier Sensing for Distributed OFDMA in Powerline Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5305940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier Sensing for Distributed OFDMA in Powerline Communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5305940/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5305940/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier Sensing for Distributed OFDMA in Powerline Communication","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"08-08-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055489S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5305940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5305941,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.

Due to the strong relationship between reliability theory and probabilistic notions, computer simulation techniques have been traditionally used to perform reliability analysis. However, simulation provides less accurate results and cannot handle large-scale systems due to its enormous CPU time requirements. To ensure accurate and complete reliability analysis and thus more reliable hardware designs, we propose to conduct a formal reliability analysis of systems within the sound core of a higher order logic theorem prover (HOL). In this paper, we present the higher order logic formalization of some fundamental reliability theory concepts, which can be built upon to precisely analyze the reliability of various engineering systems. The proposed approach and formalization is then utilized to analyze the repairability conditions for a reconfigurable memory array in the presence of stuck-at and coupling faults.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306067/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11206180","htmlLink":"/document/5306067/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Formal Reliability Analysis Using Theorem Proving","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formal Reliability Analysis Using Theorem Proving","sourcePdf":"ttc2010050579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068543S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5437556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5437556","articleId":"5306067","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5306068,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuanghua Shi","affiliation":["Allgemeine und Experimentelle Psychologie, Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4543165/5438559/5306068/5306068-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhuanghua Shi received the PhD degree in psychology from Zhejiang University, P.R.

It is known that such artifacts can influence the feeling of presence [1]. However, it is largely unknown how the packet loss and communication latency affect the temporal perception of multisensory events. In this article, we simulated random packet dropouts and communication latency in the visual modality and investigated the effects on the temporal discrimination of visual-haptic collisions. Our results demonstrated that the synchronous perception of crossmodal events was very sensitive to the packet loss rate. The packet loss caused the impression of time delay and influenced the perception of the subsequent events. The perceived time of the visual event increased linearly, and the temporal discrimination deteriorated, with increasing packet loss rate. The perceived time was also influenced by the communication delay, which caused time to be slightly overestimated.","doi":"10.1109/TOH.2009.45","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Haptics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Haptics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4543165/5438559/05306068.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TOH.2009.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5438559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Packet Loss and Latency on the Temporal Discrimination of Visual-Haptic Events","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306068/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Packet Loss and Latency on the Temporal Discrimination of Visual-Haptic Events","volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2010","accessionNumber":"11205576","pubMedId":"27788087","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306068/","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Packet Loss and Latency on the Temporal Discrimination of Visual-Haptic Events","sourcePdf":"tth2010010028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065808S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4543165","isNumber":"5438559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4543165","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5438559","articleId":"5306068","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5306070,"authors":[{"name":"Katsunari Sato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4543165/5438559/5306070/5306070-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Katsunari Sato received the BS degree in engineering from Tohoku University in 2006, and the MS degree in information Science and Technology from the University of Tokyo in 2008.

Therefore, we develop a new type of finger-shaped haptic sensor using GelForce technology. GelForce is a vision-based sensor that can be used to measure the distribution of force vectors, or surface traction fields. The simple structure of the GelForce enables us to develop a compact finger-shaped GelForce for the robotic hand. GelForce that is developed on the basis of an elastic theory can be used to calculate surface traction fields using a conversion equation. However, this conversion equation cannot be analytically solved when the elastic body of the sensor has a complicated shape such as the shape of a finger. Therefore, we propose an observational method and construct a prototype of the finger-shaped GelForce. By using this prototype, we evaluate the basic performance of the finger-shaped GelForce. Then, we conduct a field test by performing grasping operations using a robotic hand.

High gain angle droop control ensures proper load sharing, especially under weak system conditions. However, it has a negative impact on overall stability. Frequency-domain modeling, eigenvalue analysis, and time-domain simulations are used to demonstrate this conflict. A supplementary loop is proposed around a conventional droop control of each DG converter to stabilize the system while using high angle droop gains. Control loops are based on local power measurement and modulation of the d-axis voltage reference of each converter. Coordinated design of supplementary control loops for each DG is formulated as a parameter optimization problem and solved using an evolutionary technique. The supplementary droop control loop is shown to stabilize the system for a range of operating conditions while ensuring satisfactory load sharing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","volume":"25","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11260753","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5306080/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of Stability and Load Sharing in an Autonomous Microgrid Using Supplementary Droop Control Loop","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of Stability and Load Sharing in an Autonomous Microgrid Using Supplementary Droop Control Loop","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-aghosh-2032049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090408S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"457","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5306080","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5306088,"authors":[{"name":"Andy C.

Experimental results demonstrate that the even-mode matched balun achieves return losses that are greater than 15 dB at the balanced ports from 6 to 17 GHz. The measured isolation between the balanced ports is greater than 15 dB from 4 to 19 GHz. For the unbalanced port, the return loss is greater than 15 dB from 4 to 19 GHz.

Mainly motivated by increasing healthcare costs and propelled by recent technological advances in miniature biosensing devices, smart textiles, microelectronics, and wireless communications, the continuous advance of wearable sensor-based systems will potentially transform the future of healthcare by enabling proactive personal health management and ubiquitous monitoring of a patient's health condition. These systems can comprise various types of small physiological sensors, transmission modules and processing capabilities, and can thus facilitate low-cost wearable unobtrusive solutions for continuous all-day and any-place health, mental and activity status monitoring. This paper attempts to comprehensively review the current research and development on wearable biosensor systems for health monitoring. A variety of system implementations are compared in an approach to identify the technological shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art in wearable biosensor solutions. An emphasis is given to multiparameter physiological sensing system designs, providing reliable vital signs measurements and incorporating real-time decision support for early detection of symptoms or context awareness. In order to evaluate the maturity level of the top current achievements in wearable health-monitoring systems, a set of significant features, that best describe the functionality and the characteristics of the systems, has been selected to derive a thorough study. The aim of this survey is not to criticize, but to serve as a reference for researchers and developers in this scientific area and to provide direction for future research improvements.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2032660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2032660","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5314168/05306098.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5314168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Wearable Sensor-Based Systems for Health Monitoring and Prognosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Wearable Sensor-Based Systems for Health Monitoring and Prognosis","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10959202","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5306098/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Wearable Sensor-Based Systems for Health Monitoring and Prognosis","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-bourbakis-2032660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154881S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5314168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"1268","xplore-issue":"5314168","articleId":"5306098","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5306100,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Lae Park","affiliation":["Center of Design Research, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/5338866/5306100/5306100-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong-Lae Park (S'07) received the B.S. degree in industrial engineering in 2000 from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 2005 from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering.","His current research interests include fiber optic force and tactile sensing of robot manipulators for space and medical applications, the design of haptic master\u2013slave systems for minimally invasive surgery robots, and 3-D smart-robot-structure development."]},"firstName":"Yong-Lae","lastName":"Park","id":"37600943600"},{"name":"Seok Chang Ryu","affiliation":["Center of Design Research, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/5338866/5306100/5306100-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Seok Chang Ryu received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 2002 from Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea, and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 2007 from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering.","His was with Robostar Corporation, Ltd., Seoul, Korea, where he was engaged in the development of trajectory planners for the Selective Compliant Assembly Robot Arm and wafer-transfer robots.

The slack variable also enables explicit computation of a near-optimal, feasible starting point. This, in turn, enables rapid computation of the OS tension distributions. The formulation also contains a parameter that can be used to steer cable tensions toward desired regions of operation. We present static results from two simulated robotic systems that demonstrate the ability of our formulation to avoid tension limits. Simulated execution of highly dynamic trajectories on both systems demonstrates rapid-computation abilities.

The most significant error in orthogonal FIR digital-filter-based measurement algorithms arises due to the FIR filters having different magnitude gains at frequencies other than the nominal power system frequency. In addition, although the FIR filters show complete rejection of harmonics when the power system frequency is equal to the nominal, this is not the case for other values of the power system frequency. To alleviate this drawback, the filter parameters have to be adapted during frequency estimation. Suitable implementations of adaptive filters that allow closed-form calculation of coefficients, such as cascade FIR comb filters and resonator-based filters, are present in the literature. In this paper, the advantages and pitfalls of these two techniques are addressed with regard to computational complexity, coefficient sensitivity problems, and convergence. As a result, an improved and very suitable combined algorithm based on parallel resonators with common feedback combined with an external FIR comb-filter-based module for frequency estimation that is applied on antialiasing-filtered and decimated input signal is proposed. The obtained simulation results allow us to establish the performance of the proposed algorithm by comparing its measurement precision with the results obtained using fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementations. It has been found that the proposed algorithm is suitable for real-time applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","volume":"59","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11168679","publicationDate":"April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306117/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Frequency and Harmonic Magnitude Estimation Using Decoupled Modules and Multirate Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Frequency and Harmonic Magnitude Estimation Using Decoupled Modules and Multirate Sampling","sourcePdf":"tim-kusljevic-2031426.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071232S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5427296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5427296","articleId":"5306117","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5306124,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyan Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Film Integrated Device, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Haiyan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37678121000"},{"name":"Xinyu Hou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Film Integrated Device, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Hou","id":"37600936600"},{"name":"Longjiang Deng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Film Integrated Device, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Longjiang","lastName":"Deng","id":"37397309500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5306124","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2893},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface waves","Planar waveguides","Slot antennas","Frequency selective surfaces","Electromagnetic waveguides","Radar antennas","Radar cross section","Apertures","Arrayed waveguide gratings","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective surfaces","planar antennas","radar cross-sections","radomes","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-selective surfaces radome","planar slotted waveguide antenna","symmetric dual-layer frequency-selective surfaces","radiation surface","performance improvement","electromagnetic simulator","radar cross section properties","frequency 9.5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces (FSSs)","planar waveguide","radar cross section (RCS)","radome"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a new possible solution for realizing a symmetric dual-layer frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs) radome that is integrated on the radiation surface of a planar slotted waveguide antenna.

Nonparametric feature extraction algorithms have more advantages than parametric ones and are well suited for nonnormally distributed data along with being able to extract more features than the classic linear discriminant analysis. In this paper, a novel nonparametric feature extraction method, namely, cosine-based nonparametric feature extraction (CNFE), is proposed, in which the weight function embedded in the within-class and between-class scatter matrices is developed based on cosine distance. Moreover, a powerful K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification algorithm based on the distance metric formed by CNFE features is also developed, which is called the CNFE-based KNN (CKNN) classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed CNFE and CKNN is evaluated by two hyperspectral real data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that both the proposed CNFE and CKNN achieve remarkable performances on various types of training sample sizes, including the small-sample-size cases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nonparametric Feature Extraction and Its Application to Nearest Neighbor Classification for Hyperspectral Image Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2031812","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5416606/05306136.pdf","startPage":"1279","endPage":"1293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2031812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306136/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Nonparametric Feature Extraction and Its Application to Nearest Neighbor Classification for Hyperspectral Image Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5306136/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138175","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonparametric Feature Extraction and Its Application to Nearest Neighbor Classification for Hyperspectral Image Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-kuo-2031812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134344S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5416606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5416606","articleId":"5306136","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5306138,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhou","affiliation":["The Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37399618300"},{"name":"Jianxun Li","affiliation":["The Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianxun","lastName":"Li","id":"37336334200"},{"name":"Dongli Wang","affiliation":["Glorious Sun School, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dongli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405342700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5306138","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":779},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Wireless sensor networks","Power measurement","Power supplies","Bandwidth","Noise measurement","Accelerometers","Acceleration","Velocity measurement","Particle filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","particle filtering (numerical methods)","quantisation (signal)","statistical analysis","target tracking","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound","target tracking","wireless sensor network","quantized range-only measurement","randomly distributed range-only sensor","mean squared error","constant velocity","constant acceleration model","target dynamics","particle filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Posterior Cram\u00c9r\u2013Rao lower bound","quantization","target tracking","wireless sensor network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306138","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2035672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","abstract":"We consider the problem of target tracking in a wireless sensor network (WSN) that consists of randomly distributed range-only sensors.

Recursion of posterior CRLB on tracking based on both constant velocity (CV) and constant acceleration (CA) model for target dynamics and a general range-only measuring model for local sensors are obtained.

Despite substantial progress, there is a need to improve accuracy, speed, level of automation, and adaptability to new applications. This paper presents a robust and accurate novel method for segmenting cell nuclei using a combination of ideas. The image foreground is extracted automatically using a graph-cuts-based binarization. Next, nuclear seed points are detected by a novel method combining multiscale Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering constrained by distance-map-based adaptive scale selection. These points are used to perform an initial segmentation that is refined using a second graph-cuts-based algorithm incorporating the method of alpha expansions and graph coloring to reduce computational complexity. Nuclear segmentation results were manually validated over 25 representative images (15 \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vitro</i>\n images and 10 \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i>\n images, containing more than 7400 nuclei) drawn from diverse cancer histopathology studies, and four types of segmentation errors were investigated. The overall accuracy of the proposed segmentation algorithm exceeded 86%. The accuracy was found to exceed 94% when only over- and undersegmentation errors were considered. The confounding image characteristics that led to most detection/segmentation errors were high cell density, high degree of clustering, poor image contrast and noisy background, damaged/irregular nuclei, and poor edge information. We present an efficient semiautomated approach to editing automated segmentation results that requires two mouse clicks per operation.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2035102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2035102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5437399/05306149.pdf","startPage":"841","endPage":"852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Automatic Detection and Segmentation of Cell Nuclei in Histopathology Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved Automatic Detection and Segmentation of Cell Nuclei in Histopathology Images","volume":"57","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306149/","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11206204","pubMedId":"19884070","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306149/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Automatic Detection and Segmentation of Cell Nuclei in Histopathology Images","sourcePdf":"tbme-roysam-2035102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134792S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5437399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"435","xplore-issue":"5437399","articleId":"5306149","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5306153,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Lin","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5319722/5306153/5306153-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Albert Lin (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science and the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering and computer science, with a minor in biomedical engineering, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

The diode features strong nonlinearity near zero bias, enabled by a threshold-voltage modulation using a fluorine-plasma-treatment technique. The maximum change in conductance was adjusted to ~0 V, leading to optimal conversion loss (CL) of the mixer at zero bias and eliminating the need for any dc supplies. The mixer is characterized from room temperature (RT) to 250degC . At 2.5 GHz and at RT, the CL and third-order intermodulation intercept point are 12.9 dB and 17.64 dBm, respectively. The operation of the proposed diode is modeled by a physical equivalent circuit, with the element values extracted from the measured S-parameters. The voltage-biasing dependence of the CL can be explained by the model. The high-temperature operation of the mixer shows that the proposed mixer can perform well in high-temperature and ultralow-power applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2032279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5319722/05306159.pdf","startPage":"2888","endPage":"2894","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2032279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-Bias Mixer Based on AlGaN/GaN Lateral Field-Effect Diodes for High-Temperature Wireless Sensor and RFID Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Zero-Bias Mixer Based on AlGaN/GaN Lateral Field-Effect Diodes for High-Temperature Wireless Sensor and RFID Applications","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5306159/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978948","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306159/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-Bias Mixer Based on AlGaN/GaN Lateral Field-Effect Diodes for High-Temperature Wireless Sensor and RFID Applications","sourcePdf":"ted-wong-2032279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104761S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5319722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5319722","articleId":"5306159","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5306163,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay Nagesh Basavanhally","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Laboratory of Computational Imaging and Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5419290/5306163/5306163-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ajay Nagesh Basavanhally (S\u201909) received the B.S. degree in biomedical engineering from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, in 2007.","He is currently a Graduate Assistant in the Laboratory for Computational Imaging and Bioinformatics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, where he is engaged in the development of computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis tools for breast cancer histopathology."]},"firstName":"Ajay Nagesh","lastName":"Basavanhally","id":"37972712500"},{"name":"Shridar Ganesan","affiliation":["Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5419290/5306163/5306163-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Shridar Ganesan received the A.B. degree in chemistry from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 1985, and the Ph.D. degree in cell biology and the M.D. degree from Yale University, New Haven, CT, in 1993.","He was a Trainee in internal medicine at Brigham and Womens Hospital.

One such example is the presence of lymphocytic infiltration (LI) in histopathology, which has been correlated with nodal metastasis and distant recurrence in HER2+ BC patients. In this paper, we present a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) scheme to automatically detect and grade the extent of LI in digitized HER2+ BC histopathology. Lymphocytes are first automatically detected by a combination of region growing and Markov random field algorithms. Using the centers of individual detected lymphocytes as vertices, three graphs (Voronoi diagram, Delaunay triangulation, and minimum spanning tree) are constructed and a total of 50 image-derived features describing the arrangement of the lymphocytes are extracted from each sample. A nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme, graph embedding (GE), is then used to project the high-dimensional feature vector into a reduced 3-D embedding space. A support vector machine classifier is used to discriminate samples with high and low LI in the reduced dimensional embedding space. A total of 41 HER2+ hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained images obtained from 12 patients were considered in this study. For more than 100 three-fold cross-validation trials, the architectural feature set successfully distinguished samples of high and low LI levels with a classification accuracy greater than 90%. The popular unsupervised Varma-Zisserman texton-based classification scheme was used for comparison and yielded a classification accuracy of only 60%. Additionally, the projection of the 50 image-derived features for all 41 tissue samples into a reduced dimensional space via GE allowed for the visualization of a smooth manifold that revealed a continuum between low, intermediate, and high levels of LI. Since it is known that extent of LI in BC biopsy specimens is a prognostic indicator, our CADx scheme will potentially help clinicians determine disease outcome and allow them to make better therapy recommendations for patients with HER2+ BC.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2035305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5419290/05306163.pdf","startPage":"642","endPage":"653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2035305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computerized Image-Based Detection and Grading of Lymphocytic Infiltration in HER2+ Breast Cancer Histopathology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306163/","displayDocTitle":"Computerized Image-Based Detection and Grading of Lymphocytic Infiltration in HER2+ Breast Cancer Histopathology","volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138840","pubMedId":"19884074","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306163/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computerized Image-Based Detection and Grading of Lymphocytic Infiltration in HER2+ Breast Cancer Histopathology","sourcePdf":"tbme-madabhushi-2035305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13511S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5419290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"5419290","articleId":"5306163","onlineDate":"30 October 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5306169,"authors":[{"name":"Keunwoo Kim","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

This approach involves the separation of a mixed pixel into its pure components or endmember spectra, and the estimation of the abundance value for each endmember. Several techniques have been developed for extraction of spectral endmembers and estimation of fractional abundances. However, an important issue that has not been yet fully accomplished is the incorporation of spatial constraints into endmember extraction and, particularly, fractional abundance estimation. Another relevant topic is the use of nonlinear versus linear mixture models, which can be unconstrained or constrained in nature. Here, the constraints refer to non-negativity and sum to unity of estimated fractional abundances for each pixel vector. In this paper, we investigate the impact of including spatial and abundance-related constraints in spectral mixture analysis of remotely sensed hyperspectral data sets. For this purpose, we discuss the advantages that can be obtained after including spatial information in techniques for endmember extraction and fractional abundance estimation, using a database of synthetic hyperspectral scenes with artificial spatial patterns generated using fractals, and a real hyperspectral scene collected by NASA's airborne visible infra-red imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS).","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal

observations, and is computed using a numerical procedure. The resulting accurate estimate for the entropy is used to derive a new algorithm to perform independent component analysis (ICA). The new algorithm, ICA by entropy bound minimization (ICA-EBM), adopts a line search procedure, and initially uses updates that constrain the demixing matrix to be orthogonal for robust performance. We present simulation results that demonstrate the superior performance of ICA-EBM and its ability to match sources that come from a wide range of distributions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306208/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10951228","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306208/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel entropy estimator and its application to ICA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel entropy estimator and its application to ICA","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"final61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077118S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290615","isNumber":"5306184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290615","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5306184","articleId":"5306208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5306209,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel Ramasso","affiliation":["Automatic Control and Micro-Mechatronic Systems Department, FEMTO-ST Institute, Besancon, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Ramasso","id":"37670923100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4947-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4948-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"5306209","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Fault diagnosis","Supervised learning","Bayesian methods","Automatic control","Data analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Inference algorithms","Uncertainty","Possibility theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","fault diagnosis","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","fault diagnosis","evidence-theoretic propagations","temporal belief functions","partially supervised learning","HMM","transferable belief model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evidential Hidden Markov Models","State Sequence Recognition","Partially Supervised Learning","System's Health Assessment"]}],"abstract":"Evidence-theoretic propagations of temporal belief functions are proposed to deal with possibly dependent observations and for partially supervised learning of HMM.

The proposed method builds upon previous work that exploited the symmetry of the constellation and the order of the data within a spectral clustering procedure. The novelty of this work is that by adjusting the different steps of the standard spectral clustering algorithm, it introduces the expected shape of the clusters into the clustering process. The main modification applies to the construction of the weighted graph, for which it is shown that a path-based kernel, the connectivity kernel, can be a more appropriate similarity function than the Gaussian kernel. The obtained spectral clustering method is capable of finding clusters in sequential data. Experimental results are included to demonstrate the validity of the method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path-based spectral clustering for decoding fast time-varying MIMO channels","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306236","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290615/5306184/05306236.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306184","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Path-based spectral clustering for decoding fast time-varying MIMO channels","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306236/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951243","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path-based spectral clustering for decoding fast time-varying MIMO channels","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"final26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106591S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290615","isNumber":"5306184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290615","xplore-issue":"5306184","articleId":"5306236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5306247,"authors":[{"name":"Harald Romsdorfer","affiliation":["Speech Processing Group, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Romsdorfer","id":"37547847500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4947-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4948-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"5306247","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Weight control","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Speech synthesis","Speech processing","Frequency","Regression tree analysis","Training data","Feedforward systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","neural nets","regression analysis","speech synthesis","splines (mathematics)","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech prosody control","weighted neural network ensembles","artificial neural networks","statistical model","feature relevance determination","phone duration modeling","fundamental frequency modeling","classification trees","regression trees","multivariate adaptive regression splines","gradient tree boosting","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech synthesis","prosody control","neural networks","ensemble models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306247","abstract":"Ensembles of artificial neural networks (ANNs) show improved generalization capabilities that outperform those of single networks.

The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods have received a lot of attention for this unmixing process. Many of these NMF based unmixing algorithms are based on sparsity regularization encouraging pure spectral endmembers, but this is not optimal for certain applications, such as foods, where abundances are not sparse. The pixels will theoretically lie on a simplex and hence the endmembers can be estimated as the vertices of the smallest enclosing simplex. In this context we present a Bayesian framework employing a volume constraint for the NMF algorithm, where the posterior distribution is numerically sampled from using a Gibbs sampling procedure. We evaluate the method on synthetical and real hyperspectral data of wheat kernels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306262/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10943243","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306262/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian nonnegative Matrix Factorization with volume prior for unmixing of hyperspectral images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian nonnegative Matrix Factorization with volume prior for unmixing of hyperspectral images","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"final104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047264S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290615","isNumber":"5306184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290615","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5306184","articleId":"5306262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5306264,"authors":[{"name":"Genci Capi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic System Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Toyama, Gofuku, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Genci","lastName":"Capi","id":"37275279500"},{"name":"Toshihide Takahashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic System Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Toyama, Gofuku, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihide","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37291042700"},{"name":"Kazunori Urushiyama","affiliation":["Department of Life Sciences and Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Toyama, Gofuku, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Urushiyama","id":"37680938100"},{"name":"Shigenori Kawahara","affiliation":["Department of Life Sciences and Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Toyama, Gofuku, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigenori","lastName":"Kawahara","id":"37682828800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4947-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4948-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"5306264","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot control","Biological neural networks","Motion control","Neural prosthesis","Signal restoration","Brain cells","Pressing","Robot motion","Rats","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","medical robotics","motion control","neurocontrollers","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network control","brain signal","brain machine interface","prosthetic device","mechanical robot","biological robot","multielectrode recording","artificial neural controller","robot motion control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306264","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306184","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290615/5306184/05306264.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robots controlled by neural networks trained based on brain signals","abstract":"Recent works on brain machine interface (BMI) has given promising results for developing prosthetic devices aimed at restoring motor functions in paralyzed patients.

Moreover to faster convergence than MAP-LMS, this block-based adaptive filter enables us to use a compressed sensing version of it which exploits the sparsity of the channel outputs to reduce the sampling rate of the received signal and to alleviate the complexity of the BMAP-LMS. Our simulations show that our proposed algorithm has faster convergence and less final MSE than MAP-LMS, while it is more complex than MAP-LMS. Moreover, some lower bounds for sparse channel estimation is discussed. Specially, a Cramer-Rao bound and a Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound is also calculated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290615/5306184/05306268.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306184","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing Block MAP-LMS adaptive filter for sparse channel estimation and a Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Adaptive filters","Channel estimation","Bayesian methods","Matching pursuit algorithms","Sampling methods","Signal processing algorithms","Convergence","Geophysical measurements","Collaborative work"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","Bayes methods","channel estimation","computational complexity","convergence of numerical methods","data compression","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block MAP-LMS adaptive filter","sparse channel estimation","Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound","convergence","compressed sensing version","signal sampling","computational complexity","MSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing Block MAP-LMS adaptive filter for sparse channel estimation and a Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306268/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10943247","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing Block MAP-LMS adaptive filter for sparse channel estimation and a Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"final10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092138S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290615","isNumber":"5306184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290615","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5306184","articleId":"5306268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5306304,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hongyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37311096800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4897-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4828-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6773"}],"articleNumber":"5306304","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":988},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lab-on-a-chip","Software quality","Predictive models","Software systems","NASA","Packaging machines","System testing","Laboratories","Density measurement","Software metrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program diagnostics","software metrics","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lines of code","software system quality","static code metrics","pre-release defects","post-release defects","Eclipse dataset"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306304","abstract":"It is always desirable to understand the quality of a software system based on static code metrics.

We confirm the ranking ability of LOC discovered by Fenton and Ohlsson. Furthermore, we find that the ranking ability of LOC can be formally described using Weibull functions. We can use defect density values calculated from a small percentage of largest modules to predict the number of total defects accurately. We also find that, given LOC we can predict the number of defective components reasonably well using typical classification techniques. We perform an extensive experiment using the public Eclipse dataset, and replicate the study using the NASA dataset. Our results confirm that simple static code attributes such as LOC can be useful predictors of software quality.","doi":"10.1109/ICSM.2009.5306304","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290639/5306271/05306304.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"283","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSM.2009.5306304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An investigation of the relationships between lines of code and defects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An investigation of the relationships between lines of code and defects","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10951435","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5306304/","conferenceDate":"20-26 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation of the relationships between lines of code and defects","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"p274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072907S","chronDate":"20-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290639","isNumber":"5306271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290639","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5306271","articleId":"5306304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":5306358,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Uher","affiliation":["University of Nebraska, Lincolnshire, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Uher","id":"37669093700"},{"name":"Tadeusz Wysocki","affiliation":["University of Nebraska, Lincolnshire, USA"],"firstName":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Wysocki","id":"37280338700"},{"name":"Beata Wysocki","affiliation":["University of Nebraska, Lincolnshire, USA"],"firstName":"Beata","lastName":"Wysocki","id":"37268902300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4473-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4474-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306358","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306358","abstract":"As block coding and intelligent receiver combining in multi-antenna systems moves from the theorectical into the physical domain, it is necessary to apply robust analysis to the problems encountered with the development of real radio systems that are often overlooked during theoretical development of methods and processes.

The proposed scheme enhances the robustness of the system against noisy channel estimation without significantly compromising on the system throughput. It is shown that the proposed LP-OFDM allocation is more robust to estimation noise than OFDM allocations and provides sustainable mean bit error rate performance even at high MSEs.

However, it has been almost untouched in space-time-frequency coded multi-band OFDM ultra-wideband (STFC MB-OFDM UWB) systems. This paper thus proposes two cross-layer designs for cooperative communication, namely simple cooperative communication scheme (SCCS) and advanced cooperative communication scheme (ACCS), in slow fading scenarios. In the former, nodes always cooperate with one another despite the possibly erroneous reception at the partner nodes, while in the latter, nodes cooperate only in the case of successful reception. Simulations show that these schemes may considerably improve the performance of STFC MB-OFDM UWB without any increase of transmission power.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2009.5306410","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290613/5306325/05306410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2009.5306410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306325","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel cooperative communication schemes for Space-Time-Frequency Coded MB-OFDM UWB","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel cooperative communication schemes for Space-Time-Frequency Coded MB-OFDM UWB","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306410/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10943201","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5306410/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel cooperative communication schemes for Space-Time-Frequency Coded MB-OFDM UWB","confLoc":"Omaha, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"7788857final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055886S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290613","isNumber":"5306325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290613","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5306325","articleId":"5306410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5306422,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Luzio","affiliation":["Monte da Caparica, FCT-Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Luzio","id":"37392215400"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["ISR-IST, Technical University of Lisbon, Portugal","Monte da Caparica, FCT-Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis","id":"37269209500"},{"name":"Paulo Montezuma","affiliation":["Monte da Caparica, UNINOVA, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Montezuma","id":"37348727400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4473-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4474-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306422","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Quadrature phase shift keying","Fluctuations","Pulse amplifiers","Interchannel interference","OFDM","Frequency division multiaccess","Phase shift keying","Base stations","Pulse shaping methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","frequency division multiple access","multiuser detection","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain parallel multiuser detection","quasi-constant envelope","high spectral efficiency","FDMA","frequency division multiple access","OQPSK modulations","offset quaternary phase shift keying","adjacent channel interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ACI (Adjacent Channel Interference)","OQPSK modulations (Offset QPSK)","SC-FDE (Single Carrier with Frequency-Domain Equalization)","iterative receivers","I-Q interference"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we consider a FDMA (frequency division multiple access) system employing OQPSK modulations (offset quaternary phase shift keying) with quasi-constant envelope.

However, in many CR network applications, frequent channel sensing and estimation could introduce excessive overhead and reduce system throughput. Channel sensing by secondary users (SUs) may also not be completely reliable, and sensing error could result in reduced PU and SU quality of service (QoS). In this paper we examine the recently proposed use of historical CSI, combined with portfolio theory based optimization to arrive at joint channel decision and power allocation strategy for CR-OFDM. By also considering historical PU occupancy statistics, we extend this method to enable provision of a soft guarantee for both PU and SU traffic QoS. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the improved method in increasing the SU throughput and reducing PU interference, especially under conditions where the PU occupancy and signal to noise and interference ratio (SNIR) is positively correlated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Portfolio selection based power allocation in OFDM Cognitive Radio networks","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2009.5306424","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290613/5306325/05306424.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2009.5306424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306325","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Portfolio selection based power allocation in OFDM Cognitive Radio networks","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306424/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951200","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Portfolio selection based power allocation in OFDM Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Omaha, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"7767070final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058974S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290613","isNumber":"5306325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290613","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5306325","articleId":"5306424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5306427,"authors":[{"name":"Gholamreza Bakhshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Bakhshi","id":"37590223800"},{"name":"Kamal Shahtalebi","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Shahtalebi","id":"37267359800"},{"name":"Hamidreza Saligheh Rad","affiliation":["Laboratory of Structural NMR Imaging, University of Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Hamidreza Saligheh","lastName":"Rad","id":"37267360800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4473-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4474-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306427","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Solid modeling","Fading","Rayleigh scattering","Communication channels","Mobile antennas","Radio transmitters","Intelligent transportation systems","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","fading channels","MIMO communication","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-three-dimensional MIMO mobile-to-mobile channel reference model","multielement antenna systems","mobile fading channels","multiple-input multiple-output communication channels","modified geometrical two-ring systems","full-three-dimensional MIMO channel reference model","geometrical single-bounce two-sphere model","3-D nonisotropic and single-bounce scattering model","space-time cross-correlation function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile fading channels","mobile-to-mobile channels","MIMO channels","multi-element antenna systems","space-time correlation"]}],"abstract":"Analysis and design of multi-element antenna systems in mobile fading channels require a model for the space-time cross-correlation among the links of the underlying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Mobile-to-Mobile (M-to-M) communication channel.

TDS-OFDM provides better power efficiency than CP-OFDM since the PN prefix can be used for channel estimation while CP-OFDM needs dedicated pilot symbols. However, when TDS-OFDM is considered with frequency domain multiple access (FDMA) where multiple users share the sub-carriers, serious interference is generated between the prefixes of different users since the PN prefix occupies the whole bandwidth. To facilitate the application of TDS-OFDM with FDMA, two prefix design methods are proposed.

The TCOA always give optimum solution but works only when the source covariance matrices are projection matrices multiplied by the same constant and the rank constraint on the precoders is relaxed. On the other hand, the GIA does not have these restrictions. Furthermore, it is able to deal with arbitrary source covariances and allows arbitrary numbers of data streams. However, under these more general conditions, the GIA results are only guaranteed to be locally optimum. Regarding computational efficiency, the TCOA is more efficient at high transmission power and the GIA is more efficient at low transmission power when both approaches are applicable. Furthermore, the GIA and the TCOA are equivalent and both are optimum if the transmit covariance matrices obtained from the MMSE design are full rank. Numerical results show that the MSE and BER performances of the two approaches with the more practical per-antenna power constraint are very similar to those with the less practical per-user power constraint.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel MMSE precoder and decoder designs subject to per-antenna power constraint for uplink multiuser MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2009.5306440","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290613/5306325/05306440.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2009.5306440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306325","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel MMSE precoder and decoder designs subject to per-antenna power constraint for uplink multiuser MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306440/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951210","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel MMSE precoder and decoder designs subject to per-antenna power constraint for uplink multiuser MIMO systems","confLoc":"Omaha, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"7756917final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060898S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290613","isNumber":"5306325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290613","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5306325","articleId":"5306440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5306498,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Beigy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5306448/5306498/5306498-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamid Beigy received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer engineering from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 1992 and 1995, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2004.","Since 2004, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran.

This model is superior to CA because of its ability to learn and is also superior to single LA because it is a collection of LAs which can interact with each other. The basic idea of CLA is to use LA to adjust the state transition probability of stochastic CA. Recently, various types of CLA such as synchronous, asynchronous, and open CLAs have been introduced. In some applications such as cellular networks, we need to have a model of CLA for which multiple LAs reside in each cell. In this paper, we study a CLA model for which each cell has several LAs. It is shown that, for a class of rules called commutative rules, the CLA model converges to a stable and compatible configuration. Two applications of this new model such as channel assignment in cellular mobile networks and function optimization are also given. For both applications, it has been shown through computer simulations that CLA-based solutions produce better results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning automata","Application software","Lattices","Content addressable storage","Tree graphs","Stochastic processes","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Cellular networks","Computer simulation","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","cellular radio","channel allocation","learning automata","optimisation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular learning automata","multiple learning automata","state transition probability","cellular mobile networks","function optimization","commutative rules","channel assignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular learning automaton (CLA)","dynamic channel assignment (DCA)","learning automaton (LA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2030786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5306448/05306498.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2030786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular Learning Automata With Multiple Learning Automata in Each Cell and Its Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cellular Learning Automata With Multiple Learning Automata in Each Cell and Its Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306498/","volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306498/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10942746","pubMedId":"19884061","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular Learning Automata With Multiple Learning Automata in Each Cell and Its Applications","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-beigy-2030786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06336S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5306448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5306448","articleId":"5306498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5306529,"authors":[{"name":"Samson Melamed","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Samson","lastName":"Melamed","id":"37402343300"},{"name":"Thorlindur Thorolfsson","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Thorlindur","lastName":"Thorolfsson","id":"37391652000"},{"name":"Adi Srinivasan","affiliation":["Gradient Design Automation, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Adi","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"37590471900"},{"name":"Edmund Cheng","affiliation":["Gradient Design Automation, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Edmund","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37587594000"},{"name":"Paul Franzon","affiliation":["Gradient Design Automation, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA","Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Franzon","id":"37268823900"},{"name":"Rhett Davis","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Rhett","lastName":"Davis","id":"37272590000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4511-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4512-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306529","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"abstract":"In 3DICs heat dissipating devices are stacked directly on top of each other leading to a higher heat density than in a comparable 2D chip. 3D integration also moves the majority of active devices further away from the heatsink.

Gradient FireBolt was used to perform an appropriate 3D thermal analysis on a 1024-point, memory-on-logic 3DIC FFT processor for synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The chip was simulated with a spatial resolution of 80 nm, and was modeled to include the effect of each line of interconnect, as well as each via and fill structure exactly as drawn in the layout. Large isolated temperature spikes were found near groups of clock buffers at the edge of the SRAMs on the middle tier. It was found that lowering the simulation resolution and using composite thermal conductivities failed to accurately predict the location of these tentpoles.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290624/5306519/05306529.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Junction-level thermal extraction and simulation of 3DICs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Resistance heating","Heat engines","Thermal degradation","Computational modeling","Thermal conductivity","Analytical models","Thermal engineering","Computer simulation","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","fast Fourier transforms","heat sinks","synthetic aperture radar","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["junction-level thermal extraction","3D IC heat dissipating devices","3D integration","heatsink","Gradient FireBolt","3D thermal analysis","memory-on-logic 3D IC FFT processor","synthetic aperture radar","SRAM","simulation resolution","composite thermal conductivities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Junction-level thermal extraction and simulation of 3DICs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306529/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951258","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Junction-level thermal extraction and simulation of 3DICs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074747S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290624","isNumber":"5306519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290624","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5306519","articleId":"5306529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5306530,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Detailed sub-domain modeling with parameter extraction is the base for the system level porous-media calculations with thermal field-coupling between solid fluid and solid solid interfaces. Furthermore, the strength and weakness of microchannel and pin fin heat transfer geometries in 2-port and 4-port fluid architectures is identified. Microchannels efficiently mitigate hot spots by distributing the dissipated heat to multiple cavities due to their low porosity. Pin fins with improved permeability and convective heat dissipation are advantageous at small power map contrast and aligned hot spots on the different tiers. Large stacks of 4 cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n can be cooled sufficiently by the 4-port fluid delivery architecture. The flow rate is improved four times compared to the 2-port fluid manifold. The nonuniformity of the flow in case of the 4-port demands a more careful floor-planning with hot spots placed in the chip stack corners. This is especially true in case of communicating heat transfer geometries such as pin fin structures with zero fluid velocity in the stack center. This large velocity contrast can be reduced by the implementation of non-communicating microchannels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation of the porous-medium approach to model interlayer-cooled 3D-chip stacks","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306530","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290624/5306519/05306530.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Validation of the porous-medium approach to model interlayer-cooled 3D-chip stacks","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306530/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951259","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation of the porous-medium approach to model interlayer-cooled 3D-chip stacks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105207S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290624","isNumber":"5306519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290624","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5306519","articleId":"5306530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5306533,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We investigate various techniques that can impact the quality of power delivery in 3D ICs. These include through-silicon via (TSV) size and spacing, controlled collapse chip connection (C4) spacing, and a combination of dedicated and shared power delivery. Our evaluation system is composed of quad-core chip multiprocessor, memory, and accelerator engine. Each of these modules is running representative SPEC benchmark traces. Our findings are practical and provide clear guidelines for 3D power delivery optimization.

Silicon Via(TSV) defect/pinhole self test circuit for 3D-IC","abstract":"The next generation of ICs will have greater density and speed than that of their predecessors due to the fact that they can be stacked into 3DICs. A common defect in this emerging technology, however, is that pinholes can form during the process of oxide deposition along the through silicon via (TSV) walls. In this paper, four analog test circuits are explored for the purposes of detecting these pinholes. Each of the circuits uses the leakage current from a single PMOS. By using this leakage current to test the resistance between the TSV and ground, one can determine whether there is a pinhole creating a short between the TSV and the substrate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306569/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306569/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10951282","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Through Silicon Via(TSV) defect/pinhole self test circuit for 3D-IC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Through Silicon Via(TSV) defect/pinhole self test circuit for 3D-IC","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037051S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290624","isNumber":"5306519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290624","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5306519","articleId":"5306569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5306575,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Velenis","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Velenis","id":"37281977100"},{"name":"Michele Stucchi","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Stucchi","id":"37325237100"},{"name":"Erik Jan Marinissen","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Erik Jan","lastName":"Marinissen","id":"37273353200"},{"name":"Bart Swinnen","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Swinnen","id":"37298389800"},{"name":"Eric Beyne","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Beyne","id":"37275277600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4511-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4512-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306575","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":930},"abstract":"The available options in 3D IC design and manufacturing have different impact on the cost of a 3D System-on-Chip.

Since DRAM tiers must be stacked between the processor tier and package substrate, we must fabricate a large number of through-DRAM through-silicon vias (TSVs) to connect the processor tier and package for power and I/O signal delivery. Although such through-DRAM TSVs will inevitably interfere with DRAM design and induce non-negligible power consumption overhead, little research has been done to study how to allocate these TSVs on the DRAM tiers and analyze their impacts. To address this open issue, this paper first presents a through-DRAM TSV allocation strategy that fits well to the regular DRAM architecture. To demonstrate this design strategy and evaluate trade-offs involved, we develop a CACTI-based modeling tool to carry out extensive simulations over a wide range of design parameters.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306577","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290624/5306519/05306577.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impacts of though-DRAM vias in 3D processor-DRAM integrated systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306577/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Impacts of though-DRAM vias in 3D processor-DRAM integrated systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10951287","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5306577/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impacts of though-DRAM vias in 3D processor-DRAM integrated systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079959S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290624","isNumber":"5306519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290624","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5306519","articleId":"5306577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5306582,"authors":[{"name":"Dean L.

This new fundamental circuit element is unique in that its resistance changes as current passes through it, giving the device a memory of the past system state. The immediately obvious application of such a device is in a non-volatile memory, wherein high- and low-resistance states are used to store binary values. A memory array of memristors forms what is called a resistive RAM or RRAM. In this paper, we survey the memristors that have been produced by a number of different research teams and present a point-by-point comparison between DRAM and this new RRAM, based on both existent and expected near-term memristor devices. In particular, we consider the case of a die-stacked 3D memory that is integrated onto a logic die and evaluate which memory is best suited for the job. While still suffering a few shortcomings, RRAM proves itself a very interesting design alternative to well-established DRAM technologies.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306582","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290624/5306519/05306582.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectural evaluation of 3D stacked RRAM caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Architectural evaluation of 3D stacked RRAM caches","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10943275","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306582/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306582/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural evaluation of 3D stacked RRAM caches","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039423S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290624","isNumber":"5306519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290624","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5306519","articleId":"5306582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5306583,"authors":[{"name":"K.

To realize high speed image capturing sensor, we have proposed a block-parallel signal processing with three-dimensional (3D) structure. Using 3D structure, the different function layers are stacked vertically and interconnected electrically by through-Si vias (TSVs), which can improve sensor performance and signal band width. On the other hand, the fixed pattern noise (FPN), caused by the circuit device variation, becomes a critical challenge. Experiments on the fabricated pixel circuit have been implemented in a single-layer (two-dimensional) 0.18-mum CMOS image sensor technology. With the analog CDS, the FPN of pixel circuit is reduced by 8.6%. To eliminate the FPN of parallel ADC, a digital CDS technique is implemented. The proposed ADC with digital CDS is designed in a two-dimensional 0.18-mum CMOS technology. The ADC design, including an 8-bit memory, a 6-bit memory, a subtraction circuit, and a comparator, occupies 100times100 mum\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n area and 0.9 mW with supply voltage 1.8 V and 1 MS/s conversion rate.

But these technologies also introduce many design options at system/chip design level, hard to grasp during the complete design cycle. Because of the sequential nature of current design practices, designers are often forced to introduce design margins to meet required specifications, resulting in sub-optimal designs. In this paper we introduce new design methodology and practical tool chain, called PathFinding Flow, that can help designers to easily trade-off between different system level design choices, physical design and/or technology options and understand their impact on typical design parameters such as cost, performance and power. Proposed methodology and the tool chain will be demonstrated on a practical case study, involving fairly complex Multi-Processor System-on-Chip using Network-on-Chip for communication medium. With this example we will show how High-Level Synthesis can be used to quickly move from high-level to RTL models, necessary for accurate physical prototyping for both computation and communication. We will also show how the possibility of design iteration, through the mechanism of feedback based on physical information from physical prototyping, can improve design performance. Finally, we will show how we can move in no time from traditional 2D to 3D design and how we can measure benefits of such design choice.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306587","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290624/5306519/05306587.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Pathfinding tool chain for 3D-stacked integrated circuits: Practical case study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automated Pathfinding tool chain for 3D-stacked integrated circuits: Practical case study","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5306587/","accessionNumber":"10951293","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Pathfinding tool chain for 3D-stacked integrated circuits: Practical case study","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072644S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290624","isNumber":"5306519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290624","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5306519","articleId":"5306587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5306589,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Whipple","affiliation":["Cadence Design Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Whipple","id":"37670834800"},{"name":"Taranjit Kukal","affiliation":["Cadence Design Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Taranjit","lastName":"Kukal","id":"37670833600"},{"name":"Keith Felton","affiliation":["Cadence Design Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Felton","id":"37670827400"},{"name":"Vassilios Gerousis","affiliation":["Cadence Design Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vassilios","lastName":"Gerousis","id":"37282473300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4511-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4512-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306589","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1015},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Integrated circuit packaging","Thermal management","Geography","Joining processes","Silicon","Cost function","Integrated circuit layout","Abstracts","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit packaging","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IC-package codesign","3D-IC design","through-silicon-vias","package-in-package design","package-on-package design","logical system-level integration","thermal-based design","package-aware system simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306589","abstract":"The implementation of a 3D IC is typically accomplished by multiple design teams, in multiple geographies, using a variety of design tools. Types of designs include a simple package, with an analog die and a digital die placed side-by-side and more complex designs include die stacks of multiple analog or digital dies in face-to-face configurations connecting with micro bumps. Through-silicon-vias (TSV's) provide an extra level of complexity allowing an individual die to connect to the component below and above it in the stack. Interposers (silicon or organic) provide greater functional density, performance, and reduced cost. Also used in 3D-IC design are package-in-package, and package-on-package design styles. This paper discusses five key ingredients necessary for the successful design of a 3D-IC regardless which method above is used. These five items are (i) logical system-level integration to connect the system of ICs and packages, including support of layout-vs-schematic (LVS) checks (ii) physical co-design across IC and package boundaries through the sharing of component abstracts and cross-fabric functionality (iii) timing, power, and thermal-based design of the 3D-IC system in context of the package (iv) package-aware

integration. Design, material and process recommendations are required to achieve 3D stacked dies and evaluate electrical performance of such chips. As a consequence, equivalent models of this incontrovertible key component become more and more mandatory. In this paper, a full parametric and frequency dependent model of high aspect ratio TSV is proposed based on both electromagnetic (EM) simulations and RF measurements. This model enables to extract TSV resistance, self inductance, oxide capacitance and parasitic elements due to the finite substrate resistivity. Its full compatibility with SPICE solvers allows the investigation of TSV impact on circuit performance.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306592","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290624/5306519/05306592.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of Through Silicon Via RF performance and impact on signal transmission in 3D integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of Through Silicon Via RF performance and impact on signal transmission in 3D integrated circuits","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5306592/","accessionNumber":"10943250","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of Through Silicon Via RF performance and impact on signal transmission in 3D integrated circuits","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091659S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290624","isNumber":"5306519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290624","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5306519","articleId":"5306592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5306593,"authors":[{"name":"Awet Yemane Weldezion","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technologies, Department of Electronics, Computer, and Software Systems, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Awet Yemane","lastName":"Weldezion","id":"37318997100"},{"name":"Zhonghai Lu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technologies, Department of Electronics, Computer, and Software Systems, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhonghai","lastName":"Lu","id":"37308609800"},{"name":"Roshan Weerasekera","affiliation":["Centre of Microsystems Engineering, Department of Engineering, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"firstName":"Roshan","lastName":"Weerasekera","id":"37319032400"},{"name":"Hannu Tenhunen","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technologies, Department of Electronics, Computer, and Software Systems, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hannu","lastName":"Tenhunen","id":"37273474300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4511-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4512-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306593","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"abstract":"Several forms of processor memory organizations have been in use to optimally access off-chip memory systems mainly the hard disk drives (HDD).

An optimized design requires guaranteeing sufficient magnetic saturation on the iron cores holding the AC coils, ensuring the efficiency of current limiting, minimizing the use of materials, as well as satisfying the safety and stability obligations. One of the key tasks in the design is the series of electromagnetic calculations, including the complex three-dimensional electromagnetic field calculation. It is extremely difficult to calculate the magnetic field distribution through purely analytical methods because of the nonlinearity of magnetization for a ferromagnetic material. We used Finite Element Method (FEM) to solve the field distribution problem, and adopted Ansoft Maxwell for the computer simulation. Simulation results revealed that the iron cores with varying cross-sections of different windows were most effective for obtaining ideal magnetizing force distribution. Optimized design of the iron cores could be based on this simulation method. Experiments on a 380 V/30 A prototype were carried out to verify the designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Applied Superconductivity and Electromagnetic Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/5293853/5306603/05306694.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Applied Superconductivity and Electromagnetic Devices","doi":"10.1109/ASEMD.2009.5306694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASEMD.2009.5306694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306603","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEM simulations in designing saturated iron core superconducting fault current limiters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iron","Fault current limiters","Magnetic cores","Superconducting coils","Magnetic materials","Design optimization","Saturation magnetization","Superconducting magnets","Electromagnetic fields","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault current limiters","finite element analysis","magnetic cores","superconducting devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FEM simulation","finite element method","saturated iron core superconducting fault current limiter design","magnetic saturation","electromagnetic calculation","Ansoft Maxwell simulation","voltage 380 V","current 30 A"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["magnetization","iron core saturation","superconducting fault current limiter","computer simulation","finite element method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"FEM simulations in designing saturated iron core superconducting fault current limiters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306694/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951468","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEM simulations in designing saturated iron core superconducting fault current limiters","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"1037PID995319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119095S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5293853","isNumber":"5306603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5293853","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5306603","articleId":"5306694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5306695,"authors":[{"name":"Zongkai Shao","affiliation":["School of Hydropower & Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zongkai","lastName":"Shao","id":"37535173700"},{"name":"Yuedong Zhan","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Yuedong","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37570528200"},{"name":"Youguang Guo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277882800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3686-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3687-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306695","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":393},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306695","abstract":"In this paper, because the induction machines are described as the plants of highly nonlinear and parameters time-varying, in order to obtain a very well control performances that a conventional model reference adaptive inverse control (MRAIC) can not be gotten, a fuzzy neural network-based model reference adaptive inverse control strategy for induction motors is presented based on the rotor field oriented motion model of induction machines.

It appears as diffuse echoes overlying anatomical structures of diagnostic importance, obscuring tissue borders and reducing image contrast. A novel clutter reduction method for abdominal images is proposed, wherein the abdominal wall is displaced during successive-frame image acquisitions. A region of clutter distal to the abdominal wall was observed to move with the abdominal wall, and finite impulse response (FIR) and blind source separation (BSS) motion filters were implemented to reduce this clutter. The proposed clutter reduction method was tested in simulated and phantom data and applied to fundamental and harmonic in vivo bladder and liver images from 2 volunteers. Results show clutter reductions ranging from 0 to 18 dB in FIR-filtered images and 9 to 27 dB in BSS-filtered images. The contrast-to-noise ratio was improved by 21 to 68% and 44 to 108% in FIR- and BSS-filtered images, respectively. Improvements in contrast ranged from 4 to 12 dB. The method shows promise for reducing clutter in other abdominal images.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFc.2009.1331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5306707/05306724.pdf","startPage":"2437","endPage":"2449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFc.2009.1331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A motion-based approach to abdominal clutter reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306724/","displayDocTitle":"A motion-based approach to abdominal clutter reduction","volume":"56","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2009","accessionNumber":"10958078","pubMedId":"19942530","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306724/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A motion-based approach to abdominal clutter reduction","sourcePdf":"t09B2437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078101S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5306707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5306707","articleId":"5306724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5306736,"authors":[{"name":"K.-Y.

In this study, we propose an effective adaptive imaging method suitable for HFR imaging based on coherence-factor (CF) weighting and the minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) method. The CF is an index of focusing quality estimated from receive-channel data in which the amplitude of each image pixel is weighted by the corresponding CF so as to reduce the unwanted sidelobes. Direct implementation of CF weighting in HFR imaging does not provide satisfactory results because the broad transmit beams required for HFR imaging reduce the accuracy of CF calculations. In this study, we alleviated this problem by applying the MVDR method. We test the proposed method with the synthetic transmit aperture method where only 8 firings are required to form an image. Both simulations and clinical breast imaging data were used, and the proposed method enhanced the mean contrast by around 4.6 dB and the mean contrast-to-noise ratio by around 20%. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective at improving the image quality.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1293","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5306744/05306757.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"2097","endPage":"2110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MVDR-based coherence weighting for high-frame-rate adaptive imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"MVDR-based coherence weighting for high-frame-rate adaptive imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306757/","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5306757/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2009","accessionNumber":"10943182","pubMedId":"19942498","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MVDR-based coherence weighting for high-frame-rate adaptive imaging","sourcePdf":"t09a2097.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09046S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5306744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5306744","articleId":"5306757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5306759,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The excitation pulse complexes are transmitted to generate a second order ultrasound field (SURF) imaging synthetic transmit beam. This beam has reduced amplitude near the transducer, which illustrates the multiple scattering suppression ability of the imaging method. Field simulations solving a nonlinear wave equation are used to calculate SURF imaging beams, which are compared with beams for pulse inversion (PI) and fundamental imaging. In addition, a combined SURF and PI beam generation is described and compared with the beams mentioned above. A quality ratio, relating the energy within the near-field to that within the imaging region, is defined and used to score the multiple scattering and multiple reflection suppression abilities when imaging with the different beams. The realized combined SURF-PI beam scores highest, followed by SURF, PI (that score equally well), and the fundamental. The amplitude in the imaging region and therefore also the SNR is highest for the fundamental followed by SURF, PI, and SURF-PI. The work hence indicates that when substituting PI for SURF, one may trade increased SNR into use of increased imaging frequencies without loss of multiple scattering and multiple reflection noise suppression.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5306744/05306759.pdf","startPage":"2124","endPage":"2133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit beams adapted to reverberation noise suppression using dual-frequency SURF imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306759/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit beams adapted to reverberation noise suppression using dual-frequency SURF imaging","volume":"56","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2009","accessionNumber":"10951159","pubMedId":"19942500","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306759/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit beams adapted to reverberation noise suppression using dual-frequency SURF imaging","sourcePdf":"t09a2124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151427S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5306744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5306744","articleId":"5306759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5306761,"authors":[{"name":"I.

A tight combination of the transducer array with integrated circuitry eliminates bulky cables connecting the elements of the transducer array to a separate system of electronics. Furthermore, preamplifiers located close to the array can lead to improved receive sensitivity. A combined IC and transducer array can lead to a portable, high-performance, and inexpensive 3-D ultrasound imaging system. This paper presents an IC flip-chip bonded to a 16times16-element capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array for 3-D ultrasound imaging. The IC includes a transmit beamformer that generates 25-V unipolar pulses with programmable focusing delays to 224 of the 256 transducer elements. One-shot circuits allow adjustment of the pulse widths for different ultrasound transducer center frequencies. For receiving reflected ultrasound signals, the IC uses the 32-elements along the array diagonals. The IC provides each receiving element with a low-noise 25-MHz-bandwidth transimpedance amplifier. Using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) clocked at 100 MHz to operate the IC, the IC generated properly timed transmit pulses with 5-ns accuracy. With the IC flip-chip bonded to a CMUT array, we show that the IC can produce steered and focused ultrasound beams. We present 2-D and 3-D images of a wire phantom and 2-D orthogonal cross-sectional images (Bscans) of a latex heart phantom.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5306744/05306761.pdf","startPage":"2145","endPage":"2156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated circuit with transmit beamforming flip-chip bonded to a 2-D CMUT array for 3-D ultrasound imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"An integrated circuit with transmit beamforming flip-chip bonded to a 2-D CMUT array for 3-D ultrasound imaging","volume":"56","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2009","accessionNumber":"10943183","pubMedId":"19942502","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306761/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated circuit with transmit beamforming flip-chip bonded to a 2-D CMUT array for 3-D ultrasound imaging","sourcePdf":"t09a2145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115598S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5306744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5306744","articleId":"5306761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5306762,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolas M.

Cross-correlation proved the better algorithm at 2.7 and 5.4 mm correlation lengths (P < 0.05). Static cross-correlation performed better than moving-target cross-correlation at the 2.7 mm correlation length (P < 0.05). Finally, we compared the static and moving-target cross-correlation on a flow phantom with a skull casting aberrator. Using signal from static targets, the correction resulted in an average contrast increase of 22.2%, compared with 13.2% using signal from moving targets. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) increased by 20.5% and 12.8% using static and moving targets, respectively.

This improvement comes at the expense of an increased computational complexity. We have investigated the application of a beamspace adaptive beamformer for medical ultrasound imaging, which can be used to achieve reduced computational complexity with performance comparable to that of the Capon beamformer. The idea behind beamspace beamforming is that, instead of using the spatial statistics of the elements in the array to differentiate between signals and interference, we use the spatial statistics of a set of orthogonal beams, which are formed in different directions. This represents a shift from element space to beamspace. Because the majority of interference in medical ultrasound imaging is constrained to a limited spatial interval due to the focused transmit beam, this latter space can be reduced to a dimension that is lower than that of element space. We show, using simulations and experimental data, that this dimension can be selected as low as 3 while still achieving performance comparable to its element space counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5306744/05306765.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"2187","endPage":"2197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamspace adaptive beamforming for ultrasound imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Beamspace adaptive beamforming for ultrasound imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306765/","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5306765/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2009","accessionNumber":"10943186","pubMedId":"19942506","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamspace adaptive beamforming for ultrasound imaging","sourcePdf":"t09a2187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056084S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5306744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5306744","articleId":"5306765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5306767,"authors":[{"name":"Piero Tortoli","affiliation":["Microelectronics Systems Design Laboratory, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi de L''Aquila, Florence, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/5306744/5306767/5306767-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Piero Tortoli (M'91-SM'96) received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering from the University of Florence, Italy, in 1978.

The PZT thick film was prepared by spin-coating of PZT sol-gel composite solution. The thin PZT-5H sheet sample was prepared by lapping a PZT-5H ceramic with a precision lapping machine. The measured results of the 2 arrays were compared. The PZT film array had a center frequency of 120 MHz, a bandwidth of 60% with a parylene matching layer, and an insertion loss of 41 dB. The PZT ceramic sheet array was found to have a center frequency of 128 MHz with a poorer bandwidth (40% with a parylene matching layer) but a better sensitivity (28 dB insertion loss).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","volume":"56","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"10951166","pubMedId":"19942516","publicationDate":"October 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306775/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Very high frequency (beyond 100 MHz) PZT kerfless linear arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very high frequency (beyond 100 MHz) PZT kerfless linear arrays","sourcePdf":"t09a2304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142251S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5306744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5306744","articleId":"5306775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5306783,"authors":[{"name":"Richard M.

This work optimizes Phoenix, a MapReduce runtime for shared-memory multi-cores and multiprocessors, on a quad-chip, 32-core, 256-thread UltraSPARC T2+ system with NUMA characteristics. We show how a multi-layered approach that comprises optimizations on the algorithm, implementation, and OS interaction leads to significant speedup improvements with 256 threads (average of 2.5times higher speedup, maximum of 19times). We also identify the roadblocks that limit the scalability of parallel runtimes on shared-memory systems, which are inherently tied to the OS scalability on large-scale systems.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306783","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289333/5306778/05306783.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phoenix rebirth: Scalable MapReduce on a large-scale shared-memory system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Phoenix rebirth: Scalable MapReduce on a large-scale shared-memory system","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306783/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10943051","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phoenix rebirth: Scalable MapReduce on a large-scale shared-memory system","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057595S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289333","isNumber":"5306778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289333","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"5306778","articleId":"5306783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5306789,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Murphy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Murphy","id":"37393388100"},{"name":"Kurt Keutzer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Keutzer","id":"37267034900"},{"name":"Hong Wang","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5156-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306789","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":383},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306789","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Mobile computing","Application software","Image analysis","Portable computers","Cameras","Augmented reality","Computer vision","Computer architecture","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","microprocessor chips","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image feature extraction","mobile processors","high-quality cameras","sparse localized interest point detection","scale invariant feature transform","code-generation framework","laptop CPU","Core 2 Duo","low-power CPU","Intel Atom","low-power GPU","GMA X3100"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306789","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289333/5306778/05306789.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image feature extraction for mobile processors","abstract":"High-quality cameras are a standard feature of mobile platforms, but the computational capabilities of mobile processors limit the applications capable of exploiting them. Emerging mobile application domains, for example mobile augmented reality (MAR), rely heavily on techniques from computer vision, requiring sophisticated analyses of images followed by higher-level processing. An important class of image analyses is the detection of sparse localized interest points. The scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), the most popular such analysis, is computationally representative of many other feature extractors. Using a novel code-generation framework, we demonstrate that a small set of optimizations produce high-performance SIFT implementations for three very different architectures: a laptop CPU (Core 2 Duo), a low-power CPU (Intel Atom), and a low-power GPU (GMA X3100). We improve the runtime of SIFT by more than 5X on our low-power architectures, enabling a low-power mobile device to extract SIFT features up to 63% as fast as the laptop CPU.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306789/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10951108","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306789/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image feature extraction for mobile processors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image feature extraction for mobile processors","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043172S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289333","isNumber":"5306778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289333","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5306778","articleId":"5306789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5306792,"authors":[{"name":"Nick Barrow-Williams","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Barrow-Williams","id":"38275639700"},{"name":"Christian Fensch","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Fensch","id":"37671046400"},{"name":"Simon Moore","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Moore","id":"37276662100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5156-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306792","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":118,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":784},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306792","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Yarn","Analytical models","Protocols","Facial animation","High performance computing","Oceans","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Rendering (computer graphics)","Fluid dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Linux","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","multi-threading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication characterisation","Splash-2","Parsec","chip-multiprocessor","parallelisation","data sharing","program analysis","Linux OS","program run","core granularities","thread granularities","coherence protocol","network-on-chip","thread mapping"]}],"abstract":"Recent benchmark suite releases such as Parsec specifically utilise the tightly coupled cores available in chip-multiprocessors to allow the use of newer, high performance, models of parallelisation.

This paper thoroughly examines the crucial communication and sharing behaviour of these future applications. The infrastructure used allows both accurate and comprehensive program analysis, employing a full Linux OS running on a simulated 32-core x86 machine. Experiments use full program runs, with communication classified at both core and thread granularities. Migratory, read-only and producer-consumer sharing patterns are observed and their behaviour characterised. The temporal and spatial characteristics of communication are presented for the full collection of Splash-2 and Parsec benchmarks.

No investigation to date has profiled PARSEC on real hardware to better understand scaling properties and bottlenecks. This understanding is crucial in guiding future CMP designs for these kinds of emerging workloads. We use hardware performance counters, taking a systems-level approach and varying common architectural parameters: number of out-of-order cores, memory hierarchy configurations, number of multiple simultaneous threads, number of memory channels, and processor frequencies. We find these programs to be largely compute-bound, and thus limited by number of cores, micro-architectural resources, and cache-to-cache transfers, rather than by off-chip memory or system bus bandwidth. Half the suite fails to scale linearly with increasing number of threads, and some applications saturate performance at few threads on all platforms tested. Exploiting thread level parallelism delivers greater payoffs than exploiting instruction level parallelism. To reduce power and improve performance, we recommend increasing the number of arithmetic units per core, increasing support for TLP, and reducing support for ILP.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306793","startPage":"98","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289333/5306778/05306793.pdf","endPage":"107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306793/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding PARSEC performance on contemporary CMPs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5306793/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10943059","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding PARSEC performance on contemporary CMPs","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051151S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289333","isNumber":"5306778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289333","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5306778","articleId":"5306793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5306794,"authors":[{"name":"Sravanthi Kota Venkata","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Sravanthi Kota","lastName":"Venkata","id":"37672608100"},{"name":"Ikkjin Ahn","affiliation":["Google Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Ikkjin","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37679050900"},{"name":"Donghwan Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Donghwan","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37682894700"},{"name":"Anshuman Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Anshuman","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37674279400"},{"name":"Christopher Louie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Louie","id":"37670728500"},{"name":"Saturnino Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Saturnino","lastName":"Garcia","id":"37673191900"},{"name":"Serge Belongie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Belongie","id":"37326607300"},{"name":"Michael Bedford Taylor","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Michael Bedford","lastName":"Taylor","id":"37273314000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5156-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306794","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":109,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":650},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application software","Computer vision","Parallel processing","MATLAB","Drives","Energy efficiency","Portable computers","Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["benchmark testing","computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SD-VBS","San Diego Vision Benchmark Suite","computer vision","multi-core processors","many-core processors","MATLAB","C language"]}],"abstract":"In the era of multi-core, computer vision has emerged as an exciting application area which promises to continue to drive the demand for both more powerful and more energy efficient processors. Although there is still a long way to go, vision has matured significantly over the last few decades, and the list of applications that are useful to end users continues to grow. The parallelism inherent in vision applications makes them a promising workload for multi-core and many-core processors. While the vision community has focused many years on improving the accuracy of vision algorithms, a major barrier to the study of their computational properties has been the lack of a benchmark suite that simultaneously spans a wide portion of the vision space and is accessible in a portable form that the architecture community can easily use. We present the San Diego Vision Benchmark Suite (SD-VBS), a suite of diverse vision applications drawn from the vision domain. The applications are drawn from the current state-of-the-art in computer vision, in consultation with vision researchers. Each benchmark is provided in both MATLAB and C form. MATLAB is the preferred language of vision researchers, while C makes it easier to map the applications to research platforms. The C code minimizes pointer usage and employs clean constructs to make them easier for parallelization. Furthermore, we provide a spectrum of input sets that enable researchers to control simulation time, and to understand properties as inputs increase to leverage better processor performance. In this paper, we describe the benchmarks, show how their runtime is attributed to their constituent kernels, overview some of their computational properties - including parallelism - and show how they are affected by growing inputs. The benchmark suite will be made available on the Internet, and updated as new applications emerge.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306794","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289333/5306778/05306794.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SD-VBS: The San Diego Vision Benchmark Suite","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"SD-VBS: The San Diego Vision Benchmark Suite","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306794/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10943060","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306794/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SD-VBS: The San Diego Vision Benchmark Suite","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138138S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289333","isNumber":"5306778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289333","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5306778","articleId":"5306794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5306797,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Che","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Che","id":"37586051700"},{"name":"Michael Boyer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Boyer","id":"37570053900"},{"name":"Jiayuan Meng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Jiayuan","lastName":"Meng","id":"37411340200"},{"name":"David Tarjan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Tarjan","id":"37572977500"},{"name":"Jeremy W.

Our characterization shows that the Rodinia benchmarks cover a wide range of parallel communication patterns, synchronization techniques and power consumption, and has led to some important architectural insight, such as the growing importance of memory-bandwidth limitations and the consequent importance of data layout.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306797","startPage":"44","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289333/5306778/05306797.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rodinia: A benchmark suite for heterogeneous computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306797/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Rodinia: A benchmark suite for heterogeneous computing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10943061","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5306797/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rodinia: A benchmark suite for heterogeneous computing","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121123S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289333","isNumber":"5306778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289333","citationCount":"1437","xplore-issue":"5306778","articleId":"5306797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5306801,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Kerr","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Kerr","id":"37670146600"},{"name":"Gregory Diamos","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Diamos","id":"37393016100"},{"name":"Sudhakar Yalamanchili","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sudhakar","lastName":"Yalamanchili","id":"37265490400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5156-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306801","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":842},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Application software","Parallel processing","Yarn","Instruction sets","Acceleration","Computer applications","Programming environments","Software tools","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","data flow analysis","multi-threading","operating system kernels","optimising compilers","programming environments","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PTX kernel","general purpose application development","GPU","cost-effective approach","data-intensive application","compute-intensive application","C-based programming environment","software tool","compiler optimization","application re-structuring","microarchitecture design","program behavior analysis","NVIDIA CUDA SDK","OpenCL","UIUC Parboil Benchmark Suite","control flow","data flow","memory behavior","parallelism","full function emulator","virtual machine","parallel thread execution architecture","machine model","low level virtual ISA","data parallel execution","branch reconvergence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306801","abstract":"General purpose application development for GPUs (GPGPU) has recently gained momentum as a cost-effective approach for accelerating data- and compute-intensive applications. It has been driven by the introduction of C-based programming environments such as NVIDIA's CUDA, OpenCL, and Intel's Ct. While significant effort has been focused on developing and evaluating applications and software tools, comparatively little has been devoted to the analysis and characterization of applications to assist future work in compiler optimizations, application re-structuring, and micro-architecture design. This paper proposes a set of metrics for GPU workloads and uses these metrics to analyze the behavior of GPU programs. We report on an analysis of over 50 kernels and applications including the full NVIDIA CUDA SDK and UIUC's Parboil Benchmark Suite covering control flow, data flow, parallelism, and memory behavior. The analysis was performed using a full function emulator we developed that implements the NVIDIA virtual machine referred to as PTX (parallel thread execution architecture) - a machine model and low level virtual ISA that is representative of ISAs for data parallel execution. The emulator can execute compiled kernels from the CUDA compiler, currently supports the full PTX 1.4 specification, and has been validated against the full CUDA SDK. The results quantify the importance of optimizations such as those for branch reconvergence, the prevalance of sharing between threads, and highlights opportunities for additional parallelism.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","startPage":"3","endPage":"12","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2009.5306801","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289333/5306778/05306801.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A characterization and analysis of PTX kernels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306801/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A characterization and analysis of PTX kernels","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10943063","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306801/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A characterization and analysis of PTX kernels","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071077S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289333","isNumber":"5306778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289333","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5306778","articleId":"5306801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5306827,"authors":[{"name":"A ElKalagy","affiliation":["MACS Group, School of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"A","lastName":"ElKalagy","id":"37646034800"},{"name":"E AlSusa","affiliation":["MACS Group, School of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"E","lastName":"AlSusa","id":"37284811700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4973-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-290-015-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5306827","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":191},"abstract":"A performance-enhanced two-transmit antenna spatial modulation (SM) technique is introduced and analysed.

To highlight the achieved gains, the paper compares the performances of the proposed and conventional SM techniques in multipath fading channels. The results show that the proposed technique outperforms the conventional one in terms of BER performance.

We propose an OVSF code assignment scheme which reduces the complexity involved as compared to crowded first assignment scheme (which is one of the most popular single code assignment schemes). This is because the proposed scheme needs to check the immediate parent of the vacant code for code assignment. The crowded first scheme on the other hand checks all the ancestors of the vacant codes up to the root of the code tree. The code blocking performance can be inferior to the CFA design but the number of code searches (which decides the speed of the assignment design) is reduced considerably. Simulation results are demonstrated to show the superiority of the proposed design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call elapsed time and reduction in code blocking for WCDMA networks","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2009 - 17th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications & Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2009 - 17th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications & Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290637/5306808/05306883.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Call elapsed time and reduction in code blocking for WCDMA networks","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306883/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951354","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call elapsed time and reduction in code blocking for WCDMA networks","confLoc":"Hvar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1569226135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082906S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290637","isNumber":"5306808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290637","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5306808","articleId":"5306883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5306888,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno B.

In this work, it is proposed an anomaly detection system that monitors the network in three different levels. In the first one, data is collected from simple network management protocol (SNMP) objects and compared to profiles of normal traffic, in order to detect behavior changes. Second level of analysis includes a dependency graph that represents the relationships between SNMP objects. It is used to analyze first level alerts, confirming the occurrence of anomalies in device level. In the third level of analysis, second level alerts are grouped according to network topology information, and network administrators are informed about the context where the anomaly occurred. Tests were performed in a real network environment and good results were obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2009 - 17th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications & Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5290637/5306808/05306888.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"285","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2009 - 17th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications & Computer Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three levels network analysis for anomaly detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer network reliability","Computer network management","Computer security","Data security","Computer displays","Protocols","Telecommunication traffic","Object detection","Information analysis","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","computer network reliability","graph theory","protocols","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three level network analysis","anomaly detection","computer network reliability","computer network security","simple network management protocol","traffic analysis","SNMP objects","network topology information","first level alert analysis","dependency graph"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Three levels network analysis for anomaly detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306888/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951357","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three levels network analysis for anomaly detection","confLoc":"Hvar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1569227475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070201S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5290637","isNumber":"5306808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5290637","xplore-issue":"5306808","articleId":"5306888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5306981,"authors":[{"name":"Yuri I.

These systems will comprise multiple digital channels, where the analog-to-digital converter is moved closer to the antenna. This dispenses the need for analog beam steering and by this the use of transmit/receive modules for phase and amplitude control. Digital beam-forming will enable synthetic aperture radar (SAR) which overcomes the coverage and resolution limitations applicable to state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, new antenna architectures, such as reflectors, already implemented in communication satellites, are being reconsidered for SAR applications. This paper introduces a new digital beam-forming radar concept based on the combination of a reflector with a digital feed array. For a system example the SAR performance is estimated. Finally a novel digital signal processing approach, exploiting the signal properties of the transmitted waveform, is presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286916/5306978/05306998.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306978","publicationTitle":"2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD)","startPage":"238","endPage":"241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel digital beam-forming concept for spaceborne reflector SAR Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5306998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel digital beam-forming concept for spaceborne reflector SAR Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5306998/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5306998/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957471","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel digital beam-forming concept for spaceborne reflector SAR Systems","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"2037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058703S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286916","isNumber":"5306978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286916","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5306978","articleId":"5306998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5307005,"authors":[{"name":"Rustem B.

In this paper, we develop the log-likelihood ratios-Belief Propagation (LLR-BP) and the BP-Based decoding algorithms with the TAP approach.","doi":"10.1109/GIIS.2009.5307067","publicationTitle":"2009 Global Information Infrastructure Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Global Information Infrastructure Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289119/5307032/05307067.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GIIS.2009.5307067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307032","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative decoding algorithms of LDPC codes using TAP approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5307067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative decoding algorithms of LDPC codes using TAP approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307067/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10957624","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5307067/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative decoding algorithms of LDPC codes using TAP approach","confLoc":"Hammemet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"530181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048079S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289119","isNumber":"5307032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289119","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5307032","articleId":"5307067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5307070,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Hefnawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, Canada"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Hefnawi","id":"37284260800"},{"name":"Ahmed Iyanda Sulyman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed Iyanda","lastName":"Sulyman","id":"37265095300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4623-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4624-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3281"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-329X"}],"articleNumber":"5307070","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"abstract":"Multiple Transmit-Multiple Receive (MTMR) Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing /Space-Division Multiple Access (OFDM-SDMA) systems have recently attracted significant interests among researchers and developers because of its potentials for realizing spectrally-efficient wireless services at low complexity and costs. However, in multiuser MTMR systems, multiuser detection (MUD) techniques become more challenging, owing to the increased number of independent transmitter-receiver links, especially with multiple antennas at both ends. This paper investigates the performance of adaptive beamforming schemes suitable for multiuser MTMR OFDM-SDMA systems where both mobile users and base stations employ multiple transmit antennas. Using performance criteria such as mean-squared error (MSE) and signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR), we evaluate the performance of MTMR maximum ratio combining (MTMR-MRC) and the MTMR minimum mean-squared error (MTMR-MMSE) systems. In both schemes, it is shown that the level of interference dominates the detection of users' signal causing high error floor at low SINR and imposing restrictions on the number of transmit antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Global Information Infrastructure Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289119/5307032/05307070.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 Global Information Infrastructure Symposium","doi":"10.1109/GIIS.2009.5307070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GIIS.2009.5307070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5307070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of multiuser detection schemes for Multiple Transmit/Multiple Receive antenna aided OFDM-SDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency division multiplexing","Costs","Array signal processing","Base stations","Adaptive arrays","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","space division multiple access","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","receive antennas","transmitting antennas","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","space-division multiple access","mean-squared error","signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive beamforming","TMR-MMSE","TMR-MRC","FDM-SDMA systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of multiuser detection schemes for Multiple Transmit/Multiple Receive antenna aided OFDM-SDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5307070/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10957627","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of multiuser detection schemes for Multiple Transmit/Multiple Receive antenna aided OFDM-SDMA systems","confLoc":"Hammemet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"530411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035979S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5289119","isNumber":"5307032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5289119","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5307032","articleId":"5307070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5307115,"authors":[{"name":"Yuji Naya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Naya","id":"37681722800"},{"name":"Koichi Ichige","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Ichige","id":"37284348300"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Arai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Arai","id":"37274910900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4747-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5307115","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Wideband","Array signal processing","Interference suppression","Sensor arrays","Design methodology","Adaptive filters","Signal design","Mobile communication","Acoustic signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadband networks","FIR filters","integrated circuit design","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D FIR fan filters","wideband beamforming","interference suppression","mobile communication","acoustic signal processing","tapped-delay line","temporal domain representation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a method of designing 2-D FIR fan filters for wideband beamforming with interference wave suppression used in mobile communication and also acoustic signal processing.

In radar this original information consists of the range - Doppler map of the observed scene. The method allows undersampling since the band-limitedness of the waveform is no longer the limiting criterion, which turns to be the sparsity of the scene. Essentially, this article opens new prospects for radar waveforms by focusing on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal in comparison with chirps, and shows how the concept of agility fits in a natural way with CS as a processing tool. Examples with conventional matched filtering support fair comparisons. The scenario of a 1D range profile sparsely filled with bright spots or point targets is investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286916/5306978/05307122.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5307122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Merging frequency agile OFDM waveforms and Compressive Sensing into a novel radar concept","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Merging","OFDM","Doppler radar","Layout","Limiting","Radar signal processing","Signal processing","Chirp","Matched filters","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","Doppler radar","OFDM modulation","radar signal processing","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel radar concept","CS","compressive sensing","OFDM waveform","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal","convex optimization","Doppler map","sampling method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Merging frequency agile OFDM waveforms and Compressive Sensing into a novel radar concept","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5307122/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957367","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Merging frequency agile OFDM waveforms and Compressive Sensing into a novel radar concept","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053767S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286916","isNumber":"5306978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286916","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5306978","articleId":"5307122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5307126,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Botta","affiliation":["DIE, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Botta","id":"37318546400"},{"name":"Angelo Ioncoli","affiliation":["DIE, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Angelo","lastName":"Ioncoli","id":"37680095000"},{"name":"Mario Montopoli","affiliation":["DIEI-CETEMPS, University of L'' Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Montopoli","id":"37318544700"},{"name":"Frank S.

If the received frequencies and the angels between the target and the transmitter and the target and the receiver are known, we can search space grid by grid for desired (x, y) coordinates to find the position of the target in 2D space.","publicationTitle":"2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286916/5306978/05307131.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar target localization by using Doppler shift measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5307131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307131/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar target localization by using Doppler shift measurement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957376","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5307131/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar target localization by using Doppler shift measurement","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1700.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052159S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286916","isNumber":"5306978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286916","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5306978","articleId":"5307131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5307139,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

The azimuth resolution is determined by the antenna beamwidth. However, in practice, standard signal processing techniques require the distance between targets to be more than one resolution cell. This can prove inadequate for several relevant applications. In this paper the problem of improving the azimuth resolution for rotating surveillance radar is addressed. A data model for the case is described and a novel application of the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) processing technique is evaluated. The antenna pattern used is obtained from real measurements and the received signal is synthesized to produce target profiles with spacing smaller and larger than the resolution cell. Results show the capabilities of this technique of separating targets in azimuth spaced closer or further than one azimuth resolution cell. The processing scheme shows a large improvement in the resolution capability with respect to standard techniques.","publicationTitle":"2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD)","startPage":"230","endPage":"233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306978","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286916/5306978/05307148.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Signal resolution","Radar antennas","Radar applications","Radar signal processing","Surveillance","Data models","Mean square error methods","Receiving antennas","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","least mean squares methods","radar resolution","search radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target resolution","LMMSE technique","linear minimum mean square error","azimuth target separation","antenna beamwidth","signal processing techniques","rotating surveillance radar","antenna pattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of target resolution in azimuth by LMMSE technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307148/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5307148/","accessionNumber":"10957393","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of target resolution in azimuth by LMMSE technique","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091795S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286916","isNumber":"5306978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286916","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5306978","articleId":"5307148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUMA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5307164,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Falcone","affiliation":["University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Falcone","id":"38232410300"},{"name":"Fabiola Colone","affiliation":["University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", Italy"],"firstName":"Fabiola","lastName":"Colone","id":"37272047600"},{"name":"Pierfrancesco Lombardo","affiliation":["University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", Italy"],"firstName":"Pierfrancesco","lastName":"Lombardo","id":"37272179300"},{"name":"Tullio Bucciarelli","affiliation":["University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", Italy"],"firstName":"Tullio","lastName":"Bucciarelli","id":"37320901100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4747-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5307164","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":499},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5307164","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive filters","Bistatic radar","Bioreactors","OFDM modulation","Broadcasting","Surveillance","Spread spectrum communication","Autocorrelation","Signal processing","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive radar","telecommunication standards","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["range sidelobes reduction filters","WiFi transmissions based passive bistatic radar","auto-correlation function","802.11 access point","signal autocorrelation function","passive local area surveillance"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the feasibility of a WiFi transmissions based passive bistatic radar is analysed. The auto-correlation function of this waveform of opportunity is characterized with reference to typical signals broadcasted by a 802.11 access point and it is shown to yield a high sidelobe level which strongly limits the useful dynamic range. Proper weighting networks are proposed to cope with this limitations based on the knowledge of the expected value of the signal autocorrelation function. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated against simulated data generated according to the 802.11 Standards.

In particular, for what concerns airport ground surveillance, congested traffic in parking areas (APRON) ask for new generation of radar sensors having very high resolution during low visibility to discriminate between vehicles and aircrafts, and very high sensitivity to detect small dangerous objects like for instance a baggage. After Concorde accident occurred in Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, 25th July 2000, the capability to detect very small objects is became very important on the runway to improve as much as possible the safety during the taking off and landing operations. In addition, after the 11th of September 2001 tragic events, new airport security needs are driving the ground surveillance system requirements by demanding for new type of radar sensors able to be used against new emerging threats like perimeter intruders (i.e. persons, cars, boats,...) . An advanced millimetre wave radar for all three functions, airport surface movements control, foreign object detection (FOD) and perimeter intruders detection (PID), has been developed by Rheinmetall Italia SpA. This radar, named SMART, will be presented in this paper with particular emphasis to some technological aspects inside the antenna assembly and the transmitter unit.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306978","publicationTitle":"2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5286916/5306978/05307189.pdf","endPage":"440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimetre wave radar applications to airport surface movement control and foreign object detection","startPage":"437","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5307189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Millimetre wave radar applications to airport surface movement control and foreign object detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307189/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10957434","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5307189/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimetre wave radar applications to airport surface movement control and foreign object detection","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039129S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5286916","isNumber":"5306978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5286916","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5306978","articleId":"5307189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EuMA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5307288,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Palmese","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Palmese","id":"37300998800"},{"name":"Andrea Trucco","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Trucco","id":"37300998200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9662"}],"articleNumber":"5307288","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ims.org/main/index.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5307288","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic imaging","Chirp","Array signal processing","Delta modulation","Bandwidth","Niobium"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2034588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5307287/05307288.pdf","startPage":"4012","endPage":"4012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2034588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Corrections to \u201cThree-Dimensional Acoustic Imaging by Chirp Zeta Transform Digital Beamforming\u201d [Jul 09 2080-2086]","abstract":"In the above titled paper (ibid., vol. 58, no. 7, pp. 2080-2086, Jul. 2009), Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were not printed as the author intended.

Because of the importance of power quality in industrial bus bars when the loads are numerous, the classic methods of control (because of inherent time delay) can not been used. Therefore the fuzzy controller has been developed to for compensation because of the fast and stable response to voltage alterations. Regarding the complexity of tuning of fuzzy controller, using the trial and error method to tune them is not acceptable; however the updated numerical methods should be used. The method of using the genetic algorithm for tuning of fuzzy controllers for systems with variant specific equation will be discussed in this paper. The genetic algorithm is a powerful calculative tool that can process the numerous dote (person) simultaneously and will not be trapped in local minima's and the optimum result will be achieved. The genetic algorithm can be used for design of fuzzy controllers as mentioned in following references and in nearly all of them the specific equation of the system was clearly defined and will not been changed, additionally will reveal a unique response in all conditions (stable or unstable). The tuning of fuzzy controllers has been developed offline using the MATLAB software.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2008.5307346","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 40th North American Power Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5295137/5307292/05307346.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 40th North American Power Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2008.5307346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated and simultaneously design for STATCOM fuzzy controller with genetic algorithm for voltage profile improvement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Automatic voltage control","Fuzzy control","Voltage control","Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy systems","Control systems","Equations","Design methodology","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","numerical analysis","power system control","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STATCOM fuzzy controller","genetic algorithm","voltage profile improvement","fuzzy logic controller","voltage alterations","numerical methods","FACTS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flexible Alternating Transmission Systems (FACTS)","STATCOMGenetic Algorithm","Fitness Function","Fuzzy Controller","Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK)","Membership Function (MF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Integrated and simultaneously design for STATCOM fuzzy controller with genetic algorithm for voltage profile improvement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5307346/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10963371","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated and simultaneously design for STATCOM fuzzy controller with genetic algorithm for voltage profile improvement","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058589S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5295137","isNumber":"5307292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5295137","xplore-issue":"5307292","articleId":"5307346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5307349,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Usually damper winding dynamics in synchronous generator parameter estimation are neglected, but their affect is important particularly when considering subtransient studies for a single generator. The main obstacle in estimating the electric parameters is that damper winding currents are not available for measurement. To overcome this problem, the proposed algorithm has two steps. In the first step, the synchronous machine equations in the steady state condition are considerd where the damper currents can be neglected. In this step the electric parameters of the stator are estimsted. In the second step, a current_estimator is designed to estimate the equivalent current of the dampers on the d and q axes, from which the parameters of field and damper windings are estimated.

One proposed way to manage these systems is through the adoption of microgrids. A microgrid is a distribution level network made of several loads and DG sources that operate as a single aggregate load or generation source. Microgrids can either operate connected to the grid, or in the case of a grid fault, in an islanded mode. In this paper, we use Matlab Simulink's SimPowerSystems to model a small portion of distribution network as if it were a microgrid. We add a mix of renewable DG sources and one dispatchable source, which at maximum output can produce more power than the average microgrid load. We then simulate the four major fault types at each bus in both grid-connect and island modes and analyze fault currents and voltage levels in order to determine how the protection scheme of the distribution network would need to be changed to facilitate microgrid functionality. We show that standard protection methods are insufficient and propose the use of digital relays connected to breakers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault analysis and protection of a microgrid","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2008.5307360","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2008.5307360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307292","publicationTitle":"2008 40th North American Power Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 40th North American Power Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5295137/5307292/05307360.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5307360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fault analysis and protection of a microgrid","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5307360/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10963385","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault analysis and protection of a microgrid","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067504S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5295137","isNumber":"5307292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5295137","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5307292","articleId":"5307360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5307376,"authors":[{"name":"Mahyar Zarghami","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Mahyar","lastName":"Zarghami","id":"37072093400"},{"name":"Mariesa.

This paper discusses a novel approach for damping inter-area oscillations in a large power network using multiple STATCOMs. In the paper, it will be shown that these oscillations can be controlled by changing STATCOMs' bus voltage angles, hence regulating active power flow through the network.

It is necessary for the utilities to restore their power system as quickly as possible during extreme conditions. The exact state of the electric grid is needed to perform any corrective or preventive action during such conditions. It is possible to get a reduced set of data or corrupted data during extreme contingencies for further analysis. Major loss of sensor data during extreme contingencies may not help to determine the exact state. State estimation (SE) helps to get a better picture of the power system with an available set of measurements. In the presence of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, state estimation algorithm needs to be reformulated. The objective of this research is to identify the most efficient state estimation algorithm for different levels of data redundancy.

The diorama network is implemented on reconfigurable processor DAPDNA-2. In these years, traffic engineering has widely researched to guarantee QoS (quality of service). The proposal is an experimental solution with the on-chip diorama network, where virtual links and virtual nodes are constructed by some PEs (processing elements). We obtain the realistic traffic fluctuation through the behavior of virtual packets exchanged on the on-chip diorama network. In this paper, as first trial to achieve our final goal, we implemented diorama network and confirmed basic path calculation, where both functions are an essential function of our algorithm. The diorama network traffic engineering can realize more sophisticated network design like adaptive traffic balancing or multi-metric design.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5292023/5307415/05307432.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/HPSR.2009.5307432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPSR.2009.5307432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel traffic engineering method using on-chip diorama network on dynamically reconfigurable processor DAPDNA-2","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel traffic engineering method using on-chip diorama network on dynamically reconfigurable processor DAPDNA-2","htmlLink":"/document/5307432/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10963303","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel traffic engineering method using on-chip diorama network on dynamically reconfigurable processor DAPDNA-2","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"HPSR1569184405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051496S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5292023","isNumber":"5307415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5292023","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5307415","articleId":"5307432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5307460,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen B.

In this article, after briefly reviewing the existing major technology options, we propose a novel, spectrum- efficient, and scalable optical transport network architecture called SLICE. The SLICE architecture enables sub-wavelength, superwavelength, and multiple-rate data traffic accommodation in a highly spectrum-efficient manner, thereby providing a fractional bandwidth service. Dynamic bandwidth variation of elastic optical paths provides network operators with new business opportunities offering cost-effective and highly available connectivity services through time-dependent bandwidth sharing, energy-efficient network operation, and highly survivable restoration with bandwidth squeezing. We also discuss an optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based flexible-rate transponder and a bandwidth-variable wavelength cross-connect as the enabling technologies of SLICE concept. Finally, we present the performance evaluation and technical challenges that arise in this new network architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","publicationDate":"November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5307468/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10957824","volume":"47","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum-efficient and scalable elastic optical path network: architecture, benefits, and enabling technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum-efficient and scalable elastic optical path network: architecture, benefits, and enabling technologies","sourcePdf":"016JINNOLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030493S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5307452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"1019","xplore-issue":"5307452","articleId":"5307468","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5307469,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory S.

Through the design and implementation of this hybrid network many aspects of BPL technology were successfully dealt with demonstrating that, in addition to enhancing the power grid performance, W-BPL technology may be considered as an alternative broadband solution in rural and/or sparsely populated areas.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.5307478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307452","startPage":"140","endPage":"147","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5307452/05307478.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid wireless-broadband over power lines: A promising broadband solution in rural areas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5307478/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybrid wireless-broadband over power lines: A promising broadband solution in rural areas","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2009","accessionNumber":"10957826","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid wireless-broadband over power lines: A promising broadband solution in rural areas","sourcePdf":"026SARAFILAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06174S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5307452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5307452","articleId":"5307478","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5307481,"authors":[{"name":"Jiho Han","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Jiho Han (jhhan@mystic.snu.ac.kr) received B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

With a focus on achieving high accuracy in the real network environments, key features introduced in the new version of the standard and the exact causes and practical handling of time errors are discussed. A prototype Gigabit Ethernet switch based on a model of a combined ordinary clock and a peer-to-peer transparent clock is described to demonstrate how design decisions have been made on the overall architecture and on the functions of building blocks. Because the popularly used synchronization schemes used in legacy TDM network or based on GPS technology have high capital and operating expenses, network operators are searching for a better solution. Recently, IEEE 1588-2008 has been developed to meet the new synchronization requirements in various applications, including telecommunications backhaul networks; this article discusses the meticulous considerations for implementing IEEE 1588-based systems that are robust, cost-effective, and precise in solving the shared synchronized time problem.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.5307481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5307452/05307481.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"170","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.5307481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical considerations in the design and implementation of time synchronization systems using IEEE 1588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","displayDocTitle":"Practical considerations in the design and implementation of time synchronization systems using IEEE 1588","volume":"47","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5307481/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2009","accessionNumber":"10957835","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307481/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical considerations in the design and implementation of time synchronization systems using IEEE 1588","sourcePdf":"029HANLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061531S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5307452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5307452","articleId":"5307481","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5307493,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Madore","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women''s Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Madore","id":"37327251300"},{"name":"P.

Achieving good spatial resolution and coverage requires a large number of lines, leading to decreases in frame rate. An even more serious imaging challenge occurs with imaging modes involving spatial compounding and 3-D/4-D imaging, which are severely limited by the slow speed of sound in tissue. The present work can overcome these traditional limitations, making ultrasound imaging many-fold faster. By emitting several beams at once, and by separating the resulting overlapped signals through spatial and temporal processing, spatial resolution and/or coverage can be increased by many-fold while leaving frame rates unaffected. The proposed approach can also be extended to imaging strategies that do not involve transmit beamforming, such as synthetic aperture imaging. Simulated and experimental results are presented where imaging speed is improved by up to 32-fold, with little impact on image quality. Object complexity has little impact on the method's performance, and data from biological systems can readily be handled. The present work may open the door to novel multiplexed and/or multidimensional protocols considered impractical today.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated focused ultrasound imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5307486/05307493.pdf","startPage":"2612","endPage":"2623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5307493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307493/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated focused ultrasound imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5307493/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"December 2009","accessionNumber":"11024834","pubMedId":"20040398","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated focused ultrasound imaging","sourcePdf":"t09C2612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111509S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5307486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5307486","articleId":"5307493","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5307498,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Clarke","affiliation":["UK Research Centre in NDE, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/5307486/5307498/5307498-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Clarke was born in Oxford, UK, in 1980.

The door comprised a corrugated steel panel approximately 2.4 m by 2.4 m surrounded by a box beam frame and testing was performed in a nonlaboratory environment. A 3-D finite element (FE) model of the corrugations was used to predict transmission coefficients for the A0 and S0 modes across the corrugations as a function of incidence angle. The S0 mode transmission across the corrugations was substantially stronger, and this mode was used in the main test series. A sparse array with 9 transducers was attached to the structure, and signals from the undamaged structure were recorded at periodic intervals over a 3-week period, and the resulting signal database was used for temperature compensation of subsequent signals. Defects in the form of holes whose diameter was increased incrementally from 1 to 10 mm were introduced at 2 different points of the structure, and signals were taken for each condition. Direct analysis of subtracted signals allowed understanding of the defect detection capability of the system. Comparison of signals transmitted between different transducer pairs before and after damage was used to give an initial indication of defect detectability. Signals from all combinations of transducers were then used in imaging algorithms, and good localization of holes with a 5-mm diameter or above was possible within the sparse array, which covered half of the area of the structure.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307486","startPage":"2666","endPage":"2678","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5307486/05307498.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of the damage detection capability of a sparse-array guided-wave SHM system applied to a complex structure under varying thermal conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5307498/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the damage detection capability of a sparse-array guided-wave SHM system applied to a complex structure under varying thermal conditions","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2009","accessionNumber":"11024839","pubMedId":"20040403","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the damage detection capability of a sparse-array guided-wave SHM system applied to a complex structure under varying thermal conditions","sourcePdf":"t09C2666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11583S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5307486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"5307486","articleId":"5307498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5307637,"authors":[{"name":"Jennis Meyer-Spradow","affiliation":["Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Munster, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Jennis","lastName":"Meyer-Spradow","id":"38271045600"},{"name":"Timo Ropinski","affiliation":["University of M\u00fcnster"],"bio":{"p":["Jennis Meyer-Spradow is a senior software engineer in the Amira development team at Visage Imaging.

The goal is to achieve a good trade-off between the main beam width and the side lobe level. The non-uniform spacing in addition with the MIMO principle offers a superior performance compared to a classical uniform half-wavelength antenna array with an equal number of elements. However the design becomes more complicated and can not be tackled using analytical methods. Starting with elementary array factor considerations the design is approached using brute force, stepwise brute force, and particle swarm optimization. The particle swarm optimized array was also implemented. Simulation results and measurements are presented and discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop on Wireless Sensing, Local Positioning, and RFID","pdfPath":"/iel5/5292024/5307724/05307896.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop on Wireless Sensing, Local Positioning, and RFID","doi":"10.1109/IMWS2.2009.5307896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMWS2.2009.5307896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307724","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5307896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a linear non-uniform antenna array for a 77-GHz MIMO FMCW radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar antennas","Linear antenna arrays","MIMO","Frequency","Sensor arrays","Microwave antenna arrays","Particle swarm optimization","Doppler radar","Antenna arrays","Direction of arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","millimetre wave devices","MIMO communication","particle swarm optimisation","radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear nonuniform antenna array design","MIMO FMCW radar","frequency 77 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arrays","direction of arrival","optimization","particle swarm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5307896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of a linear non-uniform antenna array for a 77-GHz MIMO FMCW radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5307896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957957","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","conferenceDate":"24-25 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a linear non-uniform antenna array for a 77-GHz MIMO FMCW radar","confLoc":"Cavtat, Croatia","sourcePdf":"C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041597S","chronDate":"24-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5292024","isNumber":"5307724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5292024","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5307724","articleId":"5307896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5308081,"authors":[{"name":"Petre-Marian Nicolae","affiliation":["Department of Fundamental Electrotechnics, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Petre-Marian","lastName":"Nicolae","id":"38558647300"},{"name":"Dan-Gabriel Stanescu","affiliation":["Department of Fundamental Electrotechnics, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Dan-Gabriel","lastName":"Stanescu","id":"38556523800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3918-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3919-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0025"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"}],"articleNumber":"5308081","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transportation","Stators","AC motors","Rotors","Pulse width modulation inverters","Torque","Frequency estimation","Voltage control","Electric variables control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","PWM invertors","road vehicles","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric equipment","urban transportation system","trolleybus","asynchronous motor drive system","PWM inverter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308081","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308081","publicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","abstract":"The paper presents some results yielded from the research work concerning a prototype trolleybus with asynchronous motor drive system made from an PWM inverter and an asynchronous motor.

Application of traditional optimization techniques to such problems is computationally expensive with a high risk of getting trapped into a local optimum. Similarly, Genetic Algorithms (GA) suffer from premature convergence and weak exploitation capabilities. In this paper, a Niche Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (NHGA) is proposed for optimizing continuous multimodal models. This architecture of Hybrid Algorithms (HAs) organically merge Niche Techniques and Nelder-Mead's Simplex Method into GA. The NHGA is executed in the global exploitation and local exploration. In the former, a simplex search (SS) is performed in the potential niches for a quick evaluation of the promising search zones following the generation of dynamic niche sets by a Clearing Method (CM). A further SS is subsequently executed in the exploitation phase for a quick location of a global optimum in the located most promising zone and an inverse operator introduced to maintain population diversity. The proposed technique effectively alleviates premature convergence and improves the weak exploitation capacity of GAs. To emphasize its application, numerous multi-modal functions have been experimented with, and a 5-degree of freedom vehicle suspension system optimized. Analytical results indicate the potential of the approach in DDO of mechanical systems.","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308106","pdfPath":"/iel5/5295237/5308064/05308106.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","publicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of multimodal models in mechanical design by a Niche Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of multimodal models in mechanical design by a Niche Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10958024","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5308106/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of multimodal models in mechanical design by a Niche Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Nairobi, Kenya","sourcePdf":"225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05611S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5295237","isNumber":"5308064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5295237","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5308064","articleId":"5308106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5308111,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The nonlinear dynamics of the servo hydraulic actuator is incorporated in the suspension model and thus a suspension travel controller is developed to indirectly improve the ride comfort and handling quality of the suspension system. A SISO feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network (NN) model is developed using input-output data sets obtained from the mathematical model simulation. Levenberg-Marquandt algorithm was employed in training the NN model. The NNMPC was used to predict the future responses that are optimized in a subloop of the plant for cost minimization. The proposed controller is compared with an optimally tuned constant-gain PID controller (based on Ziegler-Nichols tuning method) during suspension travel setpoint tracking in the presence of deterministic road input disturbance. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the NNMPC over the generic PID based in adapting to the deterministic road disturbance.","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308111","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308064","displayPublicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5295237/5308064/05308111.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network-based model predictive control of a servo-hydraulic vehicle suspension system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308111/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network-based model predictive control of a servo-hydraulic vehicle suspension system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308111/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10963593","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network-based model predictive control of a servo-hydraulic vehicle suspension system","confLoc":"Nairobi, Kenya","sourcePdf":"222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090784S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5295237","isNumber":"5308064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5295237","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5308064","articleId":"5308111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5308119,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

We achieve resilience against this fast fading environment by differentially encoding blocks of the transmitted signals in the frequency domain within each OFDM block so that differential decoding can be performed over blocks of subcarriers within each single OFDM block.

Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show a significant performance gain by joint utilization of space, time and polarization diversity in comparison to uni-polarized systems with the same number of antennas.","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308186","publicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5295237/5308064/05308186.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308064","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time-polarization diversity in multiple-input multiple-output communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space-time-polarization diversity in multiple-input multiple-output communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308186/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10963648","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5308186/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time-polarization diversity in multiple-input multiple-output communication systems","confLoc":"Nairobi, Kenya","sourcePdf":"124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091413S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5295237","isNumber":"5308064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5295237","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5308064","articleId":"5308186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5308187,"authors":[{"name":"Mladen Bozanic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Mladen","lastName":"Bozanic","id":"37085934562"},{"name":"Saurabh Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37289905800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3918-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3919-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0025"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"}],"articleNumber":"5308187","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":683},"abstract":"This paper presents the design flow for an integrated power amplifier.

The routine also provides its user with a spiral inductor search algorithm, which can be used to generate layouts of inductors with Q-factors optimised at a desired frequency. For a typical power amplifier design case where several amplifiers are designed for application over different channels, the routine presented in this paper contributes by streamlining the design flow.

Therefore, they are widely used as an illuminating source and background lighting in liquid crystal display panels and notebook computers. However, a suitable CCFL model that can be used by ballast designers is lacking. This paper proposes a simple and user-friendly CCFL model that can help a ballast designer to predict the electrical characteristics of a CCFL under different operating frequencies and dimming conditions. The model is developed based on the energy balance equations governing the discharge process of CCFLs and the prediction of the amplitude and shape of the cathode voltage drop in CCFLs.

Polarization demultiplexing can be performed electronically, using polarization-diversity coherent optical receivers. The primary goal of this paper is the optimal design, using the maximum-likelihood criterion, of polarization-diversity coherent optical receivers for polarization-multiplexed optical signals, in the absence of polarization mode dispersion (PMD). It is shown that simultaneous joint estimation of the symbols, over the two received states of polarization, yields optimal performance, in the absence of phase noise and intermediate frequency offset. In contrast, the commonly used zero-forcing polarization demultiplexer, followed by individual demodulation of the polarization-multiplexed tributaries, exhibits inferior performance, and becomes optimal only if the channel transfer matrix is unitary, e.g., in the absence of polarization dependent loss (PDL), and if the noise components at the polarization diversity branches have equal variances. In this special case, the zero-forcing polarization demultiplexer can be implemented by a 2 ? 2 lattice adaptive filter, which is controlled by only two independent real parameters. These parameters can be computed recursively using the constant modulus algorithm (CMA). We evaluate, by simulation, the performance of the aforementioned zero-forcing polarization demultiplexer in coherent optical communication systems using PDM quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signals. We show that it is, by far, superior, in terms of convergence accuracy and speed, compared to conventional CMA-based polarization demultiplexers. Finally, we experimentally test the robustness of the proposed constrained CMA polarization demultiplexer to realistic imperfections of polarization-diversity coherent optical receivers. The PMD and PDL tolerance of the proposed demultiplexer can be used as a benchmark in order to compare the performance of more sophisticated adaptive electronic PMD/PDL equalizers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Polarization Demultiplexing for Coherent Optical Communications Systems","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2035526","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5423316/05308218.pdf","startPage":"1121","endPage":"1134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2035526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Polarization Demultiplexing for Coherent Optical Communications Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5308218/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","publicationDate":"April1, 2010","accessionNumber":"11177635","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Polarization Demultiplexing for Coherent Optical Communications Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-iroudas-2035526.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149282S","chronDate":"April1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5423316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5423316","articleId":"5308218","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5308225,"authors":[{"name":"Narushan Pillay","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"],"firstName":"Narushan","lastName":"Pillay","id":"37665391800"},{"name":"HongJun Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"],"firstName":"HongJun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37420747100"},{"name":"Fambirai Takawira","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"],"firstName":"Fambirai","lastName":"Takawira","id":"37275193400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3918-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3919-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0025"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"}],"articleNumber":"5308225","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308225","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","AWGN channels","Bit error rate","Decoding","Analytical models","Africa","Convolutional codes","Interleaved codes","Performance gain","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel coding","computational complexity","decoding","dual codes","error correction codes","error statistics","transfer functions","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-repeat-punctured turbo code","DRPTC","AWGN channel","error-control coding","Shannon limit","computational complexity","bit-error rate","BER","conventional turbo code","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","RPTC","repeat-punctured turbo code","additive white Gaussian noise channel","turbo decoding","analytical union bound","transfer-function bounding technique","codeword distance-spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distance-spectrum","puncturing","dual-repeat-punctured","turbo codes"]}],"abstract":"Turbo codes (TC) is a powerful branch of error-control coding that has exhibited performances close to the Shannon limit, whilst offering a reasonable level of computational complexity. Repeat-punctured turbo codes (RPTCs) exploit the fact that the use of larger interleavers correspond to better bit-error rate (BER) performances for the conventional turbo code, and makes use of repetition and puncturing to improve the performance of the conventional turbo code for moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Motivated by turbo codes and repeat-punctured turbo codes, we study the use of a new scheme, dual-repeat-punctured turbo codes (DRPTC) in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. DRPTCs primarily make use of repetition and puncturing and the structure of the conventional turbo code to yield a more superior performance. The decoding in principle follows the technique of turbo decoding but needs some changes to yield the performance improvement. Simulation results for the AWGN channel is presented together with the analytical union bounds derived from transfer-function bounding techniques, and the codeword distance-spectrum for the proposed scheme is presented and evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308225","publicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5295237/5308064/05308225.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Repeat-Punctured Turbo Codes on AWGN channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Repeat-Punctured Turbo Codes on AWGN channels","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5308225/","accessionNumber":"10963565","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Repeat-Punctured Turbo Codes on AWGN channels","confLoc":"Nairobi, Kenya","sourcePdf":"095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047332S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5295237","isNumber":"5308064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5295237","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5308064","articleId":"5308225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-03"},{"_id":5308226,"authors":[{"name":"Atilla Eryilmaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5446467/5308226/5308226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Atilla Eryilmaz (S'00\u2013M'06) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","Between 2005 and 2007, he was a Post-Doctoral Associate with the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.

In particular, we describe a generic randomized routing, scheduling, and flow control scheme that allows for a set of imperfections in the operation of the randomized scheduler to account for potential errors in its operation. These imperfections enable the design of a large class of low-complexity and distributed implementations for different interference models. We study the effect of such imperfections on the stability and fairness characteristics of the system and explicitly characterize the degree of fairness achieved as a function of the level of imperfections. Our results reveal the relative importance of different types of errors on the overall system performance and provide valuable insight to the design of distributed controllers with favorable fairness characteristics. In the second part of the paper, we focus on a specific interference model, namely the secondary interference model, and develop distributed algorithms with polynomial communication and computation complexity in the network size. This is an important result given that earlier centralized throughput-optimal algorithms developed for such a model relies on the solution to an NP-hard problem at every decision. This results in a polynomial complexity cross-layer algorithm that achieves throughput optimality and fair allocation of network resources among the users. We further show that our algorithmic approach enables us to efficiently approximate the capacity region of a multihop wireless network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2009.2030681","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5446467/05308226.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"651","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2009.2030681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Cross-Layer Algorithms for the Optimal Control of Multihop Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Cross-Layer Algorithms for the Optimal Control of Multihop Wireless Networks","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5308226/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11228753","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Cross-Layer Algorithms for the Optimal Control of Multihop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-aeryilmaz-2030681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105246S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5446467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5446467","articleId":"5308226","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5308231,"authors":[{"name":"Hejie Yang","affiliation":["COBRA Research Institute, Technical University Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["Hejie Yang (S'07) was born in Tianjin, China in 1982.

Analysis of the viscoelastic properties of single cells was performed for each of the loading histories by choosing an appropriate theory between the correspondence principle and the functional equation.

The model assumes forest as a homogeneous volume of randomly oriented particles characterized by a constant extinction but does not take into account the forest vertical heterogeneity, to which interferometric coherence is sensitive. In order to integrate vertical heterogeneity in forest models, two complementary models, which take into consideration the forest natural structure, are investigated through analysis of volume interferometric coherence. The first model assumes a vertically varying extinction in the volume layer, and the second model considers predominant contributions localized in a finite height interval, modeled as a Gaussian-distributed backscatter. The two forest models are compared with constant extinction RVoG in the coherence and interferometric phase aspects. Finally, the contribution of these new models for forest height inversion using the Pol-InSAR technique is discussed in the context of a two-layer ground + canopy medium.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2032538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5416603/05308279.pdf","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2032538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forest Modeling For Height Inversion Using Single-Baseline InSAR/Pol-InSAR Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308279/","displayDocTitle":"Forest Modeling For Height Inversion Using Single-Baseline InSAR/Pol-InSAR Data","volume":"48","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138143","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308279/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forest Modeling For Height Inversion Using Single-Baseline InSAR/Pol-InSAR Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-garestier-2032538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066489S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5416603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5416603","articleId":"5308279","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5308285,"authors":[{"name":"Lidong Zhang","affiliation":["ABB Power Systems AB, Ludvika, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5452108/5308285/5308285-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lidong Zhang (M'07) received the B.Sc. degree from the North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China, in 1991 and the Tech.Lic degree from Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1999.

The method can be generally applied for all grid-connected VSCs but may be of most importance in high-voltage dc (HVDC) applications. Different from the previous control methods, the proposed method utilizes the internal synchronization mechanism in ac systems, in principle, similar to the operation of a synchronous machine. By using this type of power-synchronization control, the VSC avoids the instability caused by a standard phase-locked loop in a weak AC-system connection. Moreover, a VSC terminal can give the weak ac system strong voltage support, just like a normal synchronous machine does. The control method is verified by both analytical models and time simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2032231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2032231","startPage":"809","endPage":"820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5452108/05308285.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Synchronization Control of Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Power-Synchronization Control of Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Converters","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11256778","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5308285/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Synchronization Control of Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Converters","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-zhang-2032231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162233S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"439","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5308285","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5308292,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Sup","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/5312642/5308292/5308292-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frank Sup (S\u201906\u2013M\u201909) received the B.S. degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Research Associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vanderbilt University.

In addition, the nonlinear Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) technique used in the 10GBASE-T system is vulnerable to the imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we address the problem of timing inaccuracy caused by imperfect CSI and the problem of extracting correct timing information in the presence of channel-interdependence and loop-interaction for 10GBASE-T. This paper proposes a novel averaged-sampling-phase (ASP) hybrid STR scheme, which aligns the sampling clock phase of a single phase-locked loop (PLL) with an average value of the timing information provided by each wire pair so that the impact of the noisy timing information resulting from the imperfect CSI and the timing jitter of the single PLL is reduced. Moreover, a three-phase timing recovery strategy based on our architecture is also designed to correctly extract the timing information and effectively mitigate the loop-interaction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-channel STR provides a complete loop-timed solution for 10GBASE-T and achieves a superior performance over conventional approaches in terms of robustness and timing jitter.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2009.2028595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5444572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5444572/05308302.pdf","endPage":"896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Robust Multi-Channel Timing Recovery System With Imperfect Channel State Information for 10GBASE-T","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2009.2028595","startPage":"886","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Robust Multi-Channel Timing Recovery System With Imperfect Channel State Information for 10GBASE-T","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308302/","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11227769","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5308302/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Robust Multi-Channel Timing Recovery System With Imperfect Channel State Information for 10GBASE-T","sourcePdf":"57tcsi04-ychien-2028595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083775S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5444572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5444572","articleId":"5308302","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5308306,"authors":[{"name":"Pekik Argo Dahono","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institute of Technology Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5337752/5308306/5308306-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pekik Argo Dahono (M'88\u2013SM'09) received the Ingeneur degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Technology Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia, in 1985, and the M.Eng. and D.Eng. degrees in engineering from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1992 and 1995, respectively.","Since 1986, he has been with the School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institute of Technology Bandung, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

In the first step a recently proposed ringing region detection method extracts the regions which are likely to be impaired by ringing artifacts. To quantify ringing annoyance in these detected regions, the visibility of ringing artifacts is estimated, and is compared to the activity of the corresponding local background. The local annoyance score calculated for each individual ringing region is averaged over all ringing regions to yield a ringing annoyance score for the whole image. A psychovisual experiment is carried out to measure ringing annoyance subjectively and to validate the proposed metric. The performance of our metric is compared to existing alternatives in literature and shows to be highly consistent with subjective data.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2035848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5446576/05308309.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2035848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446576","startPage":"529","endPage":"539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A No-Reference Metric for Perceived Ringing Artifacts in Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A No-Reference Metric for Perceived Ringing Artifacts in Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308309/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11229131","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5308309/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A No-Reference Metric for Perceived Ringing Artifacts in Images","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-hli-2035848.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081726S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5446576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5446576","articleId":"5308309","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5308310,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5399014/5308310/5308310-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyu Zhang received the B.S degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include low-power digital very-large-scale integrated and biomedical systems."]},"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37577942400"},{"name":"Hanjun Jiang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5399014/5308310/5308310-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hanjun Jiang (S'01\u2013M'07) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2001 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Iowa State University, Ames, in 2005.","From 2005 to 2006, he was with Texas Instruments, Dallas.

We have developed and tested a new model for traffic signal optimization based on the combination of three key techniques: 1) genetic algorithms (GAs) for the optimization task; 2) cellular-automata-based microsimulators for evaluating every possible solution for traffic-light programming times; and 3) a Beowulf Cluster, which is a multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) multicomputer of excellent price/performance ratio. This paper presents the results of applying this architecture to a large-scale real-world test case in a congestion situation, using four different variables as fitness function of the GA. We have simulated a set of congested scenarios for \u00bfLa Almozara\u00bf in Saragossa, Spain. Our results in this extreme case are encouraging: As we increase the incoming volume of vehicles entering the traffic network - from 36 up to 3600 vehicles per hour - we get better performance from our architecture.

In these novel systems, multiple batteries are used in order to prolong their operational lifetime, which is a significant metric for system usability. However, due to the nonlinear features of batteries, computing systems with multiple batteries cannot achieve the same battery efficiency as those powered by a monolithic battery of equal capacity. In this paper, we propose an algorithm aiming to maximize battery efficiency globally for the computer-assisted health-care systems with multiple batteries. Based on an accurate analytical battery model, the concept of weighted battery fatigue degree is introduced and the novel battery-scheduling algorithm called predicted weighted fatigue degree least first (PWFDLF) is developed. Besides, we also discuss our attempts during search PWFDLF: a weighted round-robin (WRR) and a greedy algorithm achieving highest local battery efficiency, which reduces to the sequential discharging policy. Evaluation results show that a considerable improvement in battery efficiency can be obtained by PWFDLF under various battery configurations and current profiles compared to conventional sequential and WRR discharging policies.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2009.2034972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431105","startPage":"350","endPage":"359","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5431105/05308327.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Battery Efficiency for Pervasive Health-Monitoring Systems Based on Electronic Textiles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5308327/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Battery Efficiency for Pervasive Health-Monitoring Systems Based on Electronic Textiles","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11171952","pubMedId":"19887329","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Battery Efficiency for Pervasive Health-Monitoring Systems Based on Electronic Textiles","sourcePdf":"titb-yang-2034972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097481S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5431105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5431105","articleId":"5308327","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5308340,"authors":[{"name":"Omer Tolga Inan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5437498/5308340/5308340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Omer Tolga Inan (S'06\u2013M'90) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2004, 2005, and 2009, respectively.","He joined ALZA Corporation (a Johnson & Johnson Co.) in 2006 as an engineering intern in the Drug Device Research and Development (DDRD) Group.

Active current feedback forces the common-mode input voltage to stay within the supply rails, reducing baseline drift and amplifier saturation problems that can be present in two-electrode systems. The bandwidth of the amplifier extends from 0.05-200 Hz and the midband voltage gain (assuming an electrode-to-skin resistance of 100 k\u03a9) is 48 dB.

While this paper primarily focuses on ECG applications, the circuit can also be used for amplifying other biosignals, such as the electroencephalogram.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2009.2032096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2009.2032096","startPage":"93","endPage":"100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/5437498/05308340.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 11 -w, two-electrode transimpedance biosignal amplifier with active current feedback stabilization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"An 11 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex notation=\"tex\">$\\mu$</tex> </formula>w, two-electrode transimpedance biosignal amplifier with active current feedback stabilization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308340/","accessionNumber":"11204208","pubMedId":"23853316","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308340/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 11 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex notation=\"tex\">$\\mu$</tex> </formula>w, two-electrode transimpedance biosignal amplifier with active current feedback stabilization","sourcePdf":"tbcas-inan-2032096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060781S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"5437498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5437498","articleId":"5308340","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5308342,"authors":[{"name":"Olutayo O.

Different prediction techniques have been proposed for OFDM systems. These range from the minimum mean square error (MMSE) techniques to adaptive techniques. However, it has been confirmed that the adaptive predictors present better performance than its MMSE counterpart. Besides, the computational complexity of the MMSE class of predictors is more costly than the adaptive predictors. In this paper we propose an improved version of an adaptive normalized least mean square (NLMS) predictor named variable step size normalized least mean square (VSSNLMS) predictor. The proposed VSSNLMS predictor is employed for the implementation of decision directed channel estimation (DDCE) for OFDM systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed VSSNLMS predictor outperforms the NLMS predictor at a cost of a negligible high complexity, and its performance is very close to that of the recursive least square (RLS) predictor that exhibits an enormous computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308342","publicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","displayPublicationTitle":"AFRICON 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5295237/5308064/05308342.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308064","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive CIR prediction of time-varying channels for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive CIR prediction of time-varying channels for OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308342/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10958054","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5308342/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive CIR prediction of time-varying channels for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Nairobi, Kenya","sourcePdf":"052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061684S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5295237","isNumber":"5308064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5295237","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5308064","articleId":"5308342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5308347,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Rasti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5415848/5308347/5308347-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehdi Rasti (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 2001 and the M.Sc. degree from Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, both in electrical engineering.

The opportunistic power control (OPC) algorithm significantly improves the system throughput but cannot guarantee the minimum acceptable SIR for all users (unfairness). To optimize the system throughput subject to a given lower bound for the users' SIRs, we present a distributed dynamic target-SIR tracking power control algorithm (DTPC) for wireless cellular networks by using TPC and OPC in a selective manner. In the proposed DTPC, when the effective interference (the ratio of the received interference to the path gain) is less than a given threshold for a given user, that user opportunistically sets its target SIR (which is a decreasing function of the effective interference) to a value higher than its minimum acceptable target SIR; otherwise, it keeps its target SIR fixed at its minimum acceptable level. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to a unique fixed point starting from any initial transmit power level in both synchronous and asynchronous power-updating cases. We also show that our proposed algorithm not only guarantees the (feasible) minimum acceptable target SIRs for all users (in contrast to the OPC) but also significantly improves the system throughput, compared with the TPC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DTPC, along with TPC and OPC, can be utilized to apply different priorities of transmission and service requirements among users. Finally, when users are selfish, we provide a game-theoretic analysis of our DTPC algorithm via a noncooperative power control game with a new pricing function.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Throughput","Interference","Target tracking","Aggregates","Base stations","Control systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","game theory","interference (signal)","telecommunication power supplies","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless cellular networks","fixed-target-signal-to-interference-ratio-tracking power control","opportunistic power control","distributed dynamic target-SIR tracking power control algorithm","game-theoretic analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed power control","dynamic target-signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) allocation","wireless cellular networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2035627","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5415848/05308347.pdf","startPage":"906","endPage":"916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2035627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Dynamic Target-SIR-Tracking Power Control Algorithm for Wireless Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Dynamic Target-SIR-Tracking Power Control Algorithm for Wireless Cellular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308347/","volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308347/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11149588","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Dynamic Target-SIR-Tracking Power Control Algorithm for Wireless Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-sharafat-2035627.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065241S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5308347","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5308348,"authors":[{"name":"Mort Naraghi-Pour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5415848/5308348/5308348-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mort Naraghi-Pour (S'81\u2013M'87) was born in Tehran, Iran, on May 15, 1954.

By employing radial-basis-function neural networks to account for system uncertainties, the proposed scheme is developed by combining \u00bfdynamic surface control\u00bf and \u00bfminimal learning parameter\u00bf techniques. The key features of the algorithm are that, first, the problem of \u00bfexplosion of complexity\u00bf inherent in the conventional backstepping method is avoided, second, the number of parameters updated online for each subsystem is reduced to 2, and, third, the possible controller singularity problem in the approximation-based adaptive control schemes with feedback linearization technique is removed. These features result in a much simpler adaptive control algorithm, which is convenient to implement in applications. In addition, it is shown via input-to-state stability theory and small gain approach that all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, three simulation examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2033563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5464482/05308354.pdf","startPage":"915","endPage":"927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2033563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DSC Approach to Robust Adaptive NN Tracking Control for Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"A DSC Approach to Robust Adaptive NN Tracking Control for Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308354/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11293030","pubMedId":"19887321","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308354/","volume":"40","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DSC Approach to Robust Adaptive NN Tracking Control for Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-li-2033563-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130203S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5464482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"375","xplore-issue":"5464482","articleId":"5308354","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5308357,"authors":[{"name":"Seon-Hwan Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5416618/5308357/5308357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seon-Hwan Hwang (S\u201907) was born in Cheongyang, Korea, in 1978.

The designed controller serves the combined purpose of a conventional power system stabilizer (PSS) and an active damping controller and provides a contribution to both network and shaft damping. This novel approach is superior because all available degrees of freedom are fully exploited by selecting not only the new eigenvalue locations but also certain elements of the left eigenvectors. These elements are obtained by solving a multiobjective nonlinear optimization problem (MONLOP). Examples are presented to demonstrate that optimizing the eigenvectors yields a better performing controller in comparison with one designed using mere eigenvalue relocation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Damping","Control systems","Power systems","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Induction generators","Power system control","Shafts","Wind energy generation","Nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","machine control","optimisation","power system stability","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized partial eigenstructure assignment-based design","active damping controller","DFIG","wind generation","doubly-fed induction generators","power system stabilizer","shaft damping","network damping","multiobjective nonlinear optimization problem","eigenvalue relocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active damping controller","controller design","doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)","eigenstructure assignment","multiobjective nonlinear optimization problem (MONLOP)","optimization","power system stabilizer (PSS)","small signal"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2032190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5452108/05308371.pdf","startPage":"866","endPage":"876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2032190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Partial Eigenstructure Assignment-Based Design of a Combined PSS and Active Damping Controller for a DFIG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Partial Eigenstructure Assignment-Based Design of a Combined PSS and Active Damping Controller for a DFIG","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308371/","volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308371/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11256763","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Partial Eigenstructure Assignment-Based Design of a Combined PSS and Active Damping Controller for a DFIG","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-nkshatriya-2032190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058977S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5308371","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5308376,"authors":[{"name":"Baochang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5382628/5308376/5308376-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Baochang Zhang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 1999, 2001, and 2006, respectively.","From 2006 to 2008, he was a Research Fellow with The Chinese University of Hong Kong and Griffith University, Australia.

In practice, there are often unknown spatial variations in the acoustic properties, and these algorithms give, at best, only approximate estimates of the true image. The question as to which approach is the most robust in these circumstances is therefore one of practical importance. Image reconstruction by \u00bftime reversal\u00bf-using a numerical propagation model with a time-varying boundary condition corresponding to the measured data in reversed temporal order-has been shown to be less restrictive in its assumptions than most, and therefore a good candidate for a general and practically useful algorithm. Here, it is shown that such reconstruction algorithms can \u00bftrap\u00bf time reversed scattered waves, leading to artifacts within the image region. Two ways to mitigate this effect are proposed.","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5405633/05308377.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5405633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2009.2032358","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2009.2032358","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308377","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic imaging","Nonhomogeneous media","Reconstruction algorithms","Tomography","Robustness","Image reconstruction","Acoustic propagation","Numerical models","Boundary conditions","Acoustic scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","medical image processing","optical tomography","photoacoustic effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artifact trapping","time reversal photoacoustic imaging","acoustically heterogeneous media","image reconstruction","photoacoustic tomography","numerical propagation model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artifact trapping","image reconstruction","photo acoustic imaging","time reversal"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Acoustics","Algorithms","Artifacts","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Light","Models, Theoretical","Phantoms, Imaging","Scattering, Radiation","Tomography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Artifact Trapping During Time Reversal Photoacoustic Imaging for Acoustically Heterogeneous Media","accessionNumber":"11118449","pubMedId":"19887310","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5308377/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artifact Trapping During Time Reversal Photoacoustic Imaging for Acoustically Heterogeneous Media","sourcePdf":"tmi-cox-2032358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053226S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5405633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5405633","articleId":"5308377","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5308378,"authors":[{"name":"Oleg Michailovich","affiliation":["Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory Department of Psychiatry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Oleg","lastName":"Michailovich","id":"37271674400"},{"name":"Yogesh Rathi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yogesh","lastName":"Rathi","id":"37299538800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"5308378","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":612},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Diffusion tensor imaging","Spatial resolution","Signal resolution","Distributed computing","Visualization","Magnetic analysis","Magnetic resonance imaging","Image resolution","High-resolution imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","harmonic analysis","image resolution","medical image processing","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spherical ridgelets","brain parenchyma","magnetic resonance imaging","cerebral conditions assessment","intracerebral connectivity","high angular resolution diffusion imaging","spatial orientation","robust analytical solution","q-ball imaging","multiresolution analysis","orientation distribution approximation","DW-MRI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiresolution analysis","orientation distribution function","q-ball imaging","ridgelets","spherical harmonics"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain","Computer Simulation","Humans","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"Visualization and analysis of the micro-architecture of brain parenchyma by means of magnetic resonance imaging is nowadays believed to be one of the most powerful tools used for the assessment of various cerebral conditions as well as for understanding the intracerebral connectivity. Unfortunately, the conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) used for estimating the local orientations of neural fibers is incapable of performing reliably in the situations when a voxel of interest accommodates multiple fiber tracts. In this case, a much more accurate analysis is possible using the high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) that represents local diffusion by its apparent coefficients measured as a discrete function of spatial orientations. In this note, a novel approach to enhancing and modeling the HARDI signals using multiresolution bases of spherical ridgelets is presented. In addition to its desirable properties of being adaptive, sparsifying, and efficiently computable, the proposed modeling leads to analytical computation of the orientation distribution functions associated with the measured diffusion, thereby providing a fast and robust analytical solution for q-ball imaging.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Approximation of Orientation Distributions by Means of Spherical Ridgelets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2035886","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5382628/05308378.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2035886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"On Approximation of Orientation Distributions by Means of Spherical Ridgelets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11084287","pubMedId":"19887312","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Approximation of Orientation Distributions by Means of Spherical Ridgelets","sourcePdf":"19tip03-omichailovich-2035886.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061806S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","isNumber":"5382628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"48","articleId":"5308378","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5308381,"authors":[{"name":"Olutayo O.

The iterative DDCE scheme is based on the fast data projection method (FDPM)-based channel impulse response (CIR) estimator and the normalized least mean square (NLMS)-based adaptive predictor. The performance of the Iterative DDCE is compared, through computer simulation, with the non-Iterative DDCE operating on a non-iterative receiver.

The iterative DDCE employing FDPM based-CIR estimator is also compared with another one employing a popular subspace tracking algorithm, the projection approximation subspace tracking with deflation (PASTd) algorithm.

In this paper, a semi range-based localization algorithm is proposed for secondary users (SUs) in CRNs to estimate the positions of the PUs. The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is to take advantage of the estimated detection probabilities, which can be obtained from the binary detection indicators of the SUs, to estimate the distances between themselves and the PUs. Moreover, the accuracy of the proposed localization algorithm is further improved by introducing both a weighted least-squares method and an iterative procedure. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the mean-square error (MSE) of the proposed localization estimator is also derived. A scenario with malicious users (MUs) is further considered, where the proposed method is modified to detect MUs. To illustrate the benefits of localization, we design a location-aware medium access control (MAC) protocol and show that significant throughput gains can be realized over conventional MAC protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","volume":"59","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11149557","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308404/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Semi Range-Based Iterative Localization Algorithm for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semi Range-Based Iterative Localization Algorithm for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2035706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117269S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5308404","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5308406,"authors":[{"name":"Seong-Wan Ryu","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5319722/5308406/5308406-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seong-Wan Ryu received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004 and the M.S. degree from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2006, where he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Division of Electrical Engineering since 2004.","His current research interests include Flash memories, multiple-gate MOSFETs, novel devices, nanofabrication technologies, and CMOS characterization.","Mr. Ryu was the recipient of the Best Poster Paper Award at the IEEE Nanotechnology Materials and Devices Conference in 2006."]},"firstName":"Seong-Wan","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37307181800"},{"name":"Jin-Woo Han","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5319722/5308406/5308406-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Woo Han received the B.S. degree from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, Korea, in 2004 and the M.S. degree from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2006, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Division of Electrical Engineering.","His research interests include multiple-gate MOSFETs, novel devices, and nanofabrication technologies, and his research covers a broad area in silicon devices ranging from device design to process development, simulation, characterization, and modeling.

The experimental results indicate the class-J mode's potential in achieving high efficiency across extensive bandwidth, while maintaining predistortable levels of linearity. A commercially available 10 W GaN (gallium nitride) high electron mobility transistor device was used in this investigation, together with a combination of high power waveform measurements, active harmonic load-pull and theoretical analysis of the class-J mode. Targeting a working bandwidth of 1.5-2.5 GHz an initial power amplifier (PA) design was based on basic class-J theory and computer-aided design simulation. This realized a 50% bandwidth with measured drain efficiency of 60%-70%. A second PA design iteration has realized near-rated output power of 39 dBm and improved efficiency beyond the original 2.5 GHz target, hence extending efficient PA operation across a bandwidth of 1.4-2.6 GHz, centered at 2 GHz. This second iteration made extensive use of active harmonic load-pull and waveform measurements, and incorporated a novel design methodology for achieving predistortable linearity. The class-J amplifier has been found to be more realizable than conventional class-AB modes, with a better compromise between power and efficiency tradeoffs over a substantial RF bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2033295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5340253/05308420.pdf","startPage":"3196","endPage":"3204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2033295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology for Realizing High Efficiency Class-J in a Linear and Broadband PA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology for Realizing High Efficiency Class-J in a Linear and Broadband PA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308420/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11007338","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308420/","volume":"57","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology for Realizing High Efficiency Class-J in a Linear and Broadband PA","sourcePdf":"57tmtt12-pwright-part2-2033295.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081767S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5340253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"245","xplore-issue":"5340253","articleId":"5308420","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5308421,"authors":[{"name":"Yves Bouvier","affiliation":["Alcatel Thales III-V Laboratory, Marcoussis, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5340253/5308421/5308421-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yves Bouvier was born in Caen, France, in 1981.

This paper proposes an algorithm to extract initial color backgrounds from surveillance videos using a probability-based background extraction algorithm. With the proposed algorithm, the initial background can be extracted accurately and quickly, while using relatively little memory. The intrusive objects can then be segmented quickly and correctly by a robust object segmentation algorithm. The segmentation algorithm analyzes the threshold values of the background subtraction from the prior frame to obtain good quality while minimizing execution time and maximizing detection accuracy. The color background images can be extracted efficiently and quickly from color image sequences and updated in real time to overcome any variation in illumination conditions.

Various scalable layers have highly distinct importance, measured by their contribution to the overall video quality. This distinction is especially more significant in the scalable H.264/advanced video coding (AVC) video, due to the employed prediction hierarchy and the drift propagation when quality refinements are missing. Therefore, efficient bit stream adaptation and unequal protection of these layers are of special interest in the scalable H.264/AVC video. This paper proposes an algorithm to accurately estimate the overall distortion of decoder reconstructed frames due to enhancement layer truncation, drift/error propagation, and error concealment in the scalable H.264/AVC video. The method recursively computes the total decoder expected distortion at the picture-level for each layer in the prediction hierarchy. This ensures low computational cost since it bypasses highly complex pixel-level motion compensation operations. Simulation results show an accurate distortion estimation at various channel loss rates. The estimate is further integrated into a cross-layer optimization framework for optimized bit extraction and content-aware channel rate allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that precise distortion estimation enables our proposed transmission system to achieve a significantly higher average video peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to a conventional content independent system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5424181/05308439.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2035846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2035846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5424181","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal Error Protection for Robust Streaming of Scalable Video Over Packet Lossy Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Robustness","Streaming media","Automatic voltage control","Video coding","Decoding","Resilience","Propagation losses","Protection","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","codecs","image reconstruction","motion compensation","packet radio networks","video coding","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unequal error protection","scalable video robust streaming","packet lossy networks","scalable video coding","advanced video coding","H.264/AVC video","decoder reconstructed frames","enhancement layer truncation","drift/error propagation","error concealment","pixel-level motion compensation","distortion estimation","bit extraction","content-aware channel rate allocation","transmission system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel coding","error correction coding","multimedia communication","video coding","video signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Unequal Error Protection for Robust Streaming of Scalable Video Over Packet Lossy Networks","volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5308439/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11156435","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal Error Protection for Robust Streaming of Scalable Video Over Packet Lossy Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-emaani-2035846.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064528S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5424181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5424181","articleId":"5308439","onlineDate":"03 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5308448,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The presented technique is a coherent one, which allows flight parameters to be estimated more precisely than in the other well-known parametric technique referred to as classical MD.

The rectifier has a cross-coupled bridge configuration and is driven by a differential RF input. A differential-drive active gate bias mechanism simultaneously enables both low ON-resistance and small reverse leakage of diode-connected MOS transistors, resulting in large power conversion efficiency (PCE), especially under small RF input power conditions. A test circuit of the proposed differential-drive rectifier was fabricated with 0.18 mu m CMOS technology, and the measured performance was compared with those of other types of rectifiers. Dependence of the PCE on the input RF signal frequency, output loading conditions and transistor sizing was also evaluated. At the single-stage configuration, 67.5% of PCE was achieved under conditions of 953 MHz, - 12.5 dBm RF input and 10 KOmega output load. This is twice as large as that of the state-of-the-art rectifier circuit. The peak PCE increases with a decrease in operation frequency and with an increase in output load resistance. In addition, experimental results show the existence of an optimum transistor size in accordance with the output loading conditions. The multi-stage configuration for larger output DC voltage is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2028955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2028955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5308580/05308586.pdf","startPage":"3011","endPage":"3018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency Differential-Drive CMOS Rectifier for UHF RFIDs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Differential-Drive CMOS Rectifier for UHF RFIDs","volume":"44","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308586/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957770","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308586/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Differential-Drive CMOS Rectifier for UHF RFIDs","sourcePdf":"44jssc11-kkotani-2028955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06129S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5308580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"309","xplore-issue":"5308580","articleId":"5308586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5308587,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Ohhata","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5308580/5308587/5308587-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kenichi Ohhata received the B.S. degree in physics from Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan, in 1983, and the Ph.D. degree from Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2000.","In 1983, he joined the Hitachi Device Engineering Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan.

Pseudo-differential signaling to overcome problems of conventional single-ended signaling is proposed. In a conventional single-ended signaling, the reference signal from a transmitter is generally used to reduce the common-mode noise which is induced by simultaneous switching noise (SSN). However, as supply voltage becomes low and data rate increases, the reference signal reduces the voltage and timing margin of receiver inputs. The proposed transceiver uses the pseudo-differential signaling without the reference signal and encoding schemes using the relation between neighboring data are proposed to remove the reference signal.

A test chip is implemented in a 45 nm CMOS process. Large-scale SRAM read/write metrics are measured and compared against conventional SRAM stability metrics. Results show excellent correlation to conventional SRAM read/write metrics as well as V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MIN</sub>\n measurements near failure.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5308580/05308605.pdf","startPage":"3174","endPage":"3192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Scale SRAM Variability Characterization in 45 nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale SRAM Variability Characterization in 45 nm CMOS","volume":"44","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308605/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957784","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308605/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale SRAM Variability Characterization in 45 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-nikolic-2032698.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114134S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5308580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5308580","articleId":"5308605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5308613,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Ryckaert","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5308580/5308613/5308613-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Julien Ryckaert (S'06-M'07) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Brussels (ULB), Belgium, in 2000. and the Ph.D. degree from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) in 2007.","He joined IMEC, Leuven, Belgium, in 2000 as an RF designer for WLAN transceivers.

The increasing popularity of video capture and playback on portable devices requires that the power of the video codec be kept to a minimum.

Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling can efficiently adapt to the varying workloads by leveraging the low voltage capabilities and domain partitioning of the decoder.

For high definition 720p video decoding at 30 frames per second (fps), it operates down to 0.7 V with a measured power of 1.8 mW, which is significantly lower than previously published results.

Therefore, designing memories with dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) capability is important since significant active as well as leakage power savings can be achieved by voltage scaling. However, optimizing circuit operation over a large voltage range is not trivial due to conflicting trade-offs of low-voltage (moderate and weak inversion) and high-voltage (strong inversion) transistor characteristics. Specifically, low-voltage operation requires various assist circuits for functionality which might severely impact high-voltage performance. Reconfigurable assist circuits provide the necessary adaptability for circuits to adjust themselves to the requirements of the voltage range that they are operating in. This paper presents a 64 kb reconfigurable SRAM fabricated in 65 nm low-power CMOS process operating from 250 mV to 1.2 V. This wide supply range was enabled by a combination of circuits optimized for both subthreshold and above-threshold regimes and by employing hardware reconfigurability. Three different write-assist schemes can be selectively enabled to provide write functionality down to very low voltage levels while preventing excessive power overhead. Two different sense-amplifiers are implemented to minimize sensing delay over a large voltage range. A prototype test chip is tested to be operational at 20 kHz with 250 mV supply and 200 MHz with 1.2 V supply. Over this range leakage power scales by more than 50 X and a minimum energy point is achieved at 0.4 V with less than 0.1 pJ/bit/access.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5308580/05308728.pdf","startPage":"3163","endPage":"3173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable 8T Ultra-Dynamic Voltage Scalable (U-DVS) SRAM in 65 nm CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5308728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable 8T Ultra-Dynamic Voltage Scalable (U-DVS) SRAM in 65 nm CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5308728/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10957790","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5308728/","volume":"44","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable 8T Ultra-Dynamic Voltage Scalable (U-DVS) SRAM in 65 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"44jssc11-msinangil-2032493.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11614S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5308580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5308580","articleId":"5308728","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5308729,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5308580/5308729/5308729-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pengfei Li (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004, and the M.S. degree from University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2006.

The IC is implemented in a 0.25-mum CMOS process. The fully-integrated sensor interface is based on a DeltaSigma sensor front-end that operates mechanically in an open-loop configuration and converts the acceleration signals directly into the digital domain, thus avoiding the use of separate analog-to-digital converters. A detailed analysis with transfer functions is presented for the front-end circuit. Furthermore, the interface IC includes a decimator, a frequency reference, a clock generator for the front-end, a voltage and current reference, the required reference buffers, and low-dropout regulators (LDOs) needed for system-on-chip power management. The interface IC provides operating modes with 12-bit resolution for 1 and 25 Hz signal bandwidths. The former is optimized for very low power dissipation at the cost of reduced bandwidth, and is intended for example for activity monitoring in otherwise powered-off devices.

In order to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy, sharp acceleration/deceleration and idling should be avoided as much as possible. Unlike on freeways, traffic on signalized corridors suffers from increased fuel consumption and emissions due to idling and acceleration/deceleration maneuvers at traffic signals. By taking advantage of the recent developments in communication technology between vehicles and roadside infrastructure, it is possible for vehicles to receive the signal phase and timing information well in advance of approaching a signalized intersection. Based on this traffic signal information, we have developed arterial velocity planning algorithms that give dynamic speed advice to the driver so that the probability of having a green light is maximized when approaching signalized intersections. The algorithms are aimed at minimizing the acceleration/deceleration rates while ensuring that the vehicle never exceeds the speed limit, and that it will pass through intersections without coming to a stop. Using a stochastic simulation technique, the algorithms are used to generate sample vehicle velocity profiles along a 10-intersection signalized corridor. The resulting vehicle fuel consumption and emissions from these velocity profiles are calculated using a modal emissions model, and then compared with those from a typical velocity profile of vehicles without velocity planning. The energy/emission savings for vehicles with velocity planning are found to be 12-14%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arterial velocity planning based on traffic signal information under light traffic conditions","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309519","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305882/5309513/05309519.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5309513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5309519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5309519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Arterial velocity planning based on traffic signal information under light traffic conditions","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5309519/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964879","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arterial velocity planning based on traffic signal information under light traffic conditions","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050351S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305882","isNumber":"5309513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305882","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5309513","articleId":"5309519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":5309571,"authors":[{"name":"Anupama Krishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Anupama","lastName":"Krishnan","id":"37665199800"},{"name":"Chris Lewis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Lewis","id":"37668203000"},{"name":"Dwight Day","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Dwight","lastName":"Day","id":"38548904200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5519-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5520-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"5309571","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Image segmentation","Road transportation","Intelligent transportation systems","Clustering algorithms","Automated highways","Cameras","USA Councils","System testing","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image segmentation","traffic information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision system","road sign identification","triangulation","bundle adjustment","K-means clustering algorithm","image segmentation","image classification","receiver operating characteristic curves"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["K-Means Segmentation","mahalanobis distance","receiver operating characteristics (ROC)","scale invariant feature transform (SIFT)","triangulation","bundle adjustment"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents improvements made to an automated machine vision system that identifies and inventories road signs. The system processes imagery from the Kansas Department of Transportation's road profiler that captures images every 26.4 feet on highways through out the state. The initial system processed images using a computationally efficient K-means clustering algorithm twice, first on the original image and then again on a difference image to segment the images into objects. Next, object segments were classified based on their size and color. An additional classification step was applied examining the frame to frame trajectory that objects take through the field of view. This technique represented a crude form of triangulation. It was quite effective for signs along straight highways, but often failed along curves when trajectories deviate from the norm. This paper describes how full triangulation was implemented with bundle adjustment to determine the object's physical location relative to the road profiler. Object locations are then added to the list of criteria determining classification. As with the original size and color classifiers, a representative image set was segmented and manually labeled to determine a joint probabilistic model characterizing the expected location of signs. Receiver operating characteristic curves were analyzed to adjust the thresholds for class identification. The improved sign inventory system was tested and its performance characteristics are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309571","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305882/5309513/05309571.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5309513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision system for identifying road signs using triangulation and bundle adjustment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5309571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5309571/","displayDocTitle":"Vision system for identifying road signs using triangulation and bundle adjustment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964892","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5309571/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision system for identifying road signs using triangulation and bundle adjustment","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057798S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305882","isNumber":"5309513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305882","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5309513","articleId":"5309571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5309672,"authors":[{"name":"Barlomiej Blaszczyszyn","affiliation":["INRIA/ENS, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Barlomiej","lastName":"Blaszczyszyn","id":"37399197400"},{"name":"Paul Muhlethaler","affiliation":["INRIA Rocquencourt, Le Chesnay, France"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Muhlethaler","id":"37296445000"},{"name":"Yasser Toor","affiliation":["INRIA Rocquencourt, Le Chesnay, France"],"firstName":"Yasser","lastName":"Toor","id":"37660289100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5519-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5520-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"5309672","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Attenuation","Fading","Road safety","Ad hoc networks","Mobile ad hoc networks","Network topology","Vehicles","Wireless application protocol","Access protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","carrier sense multiple access","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAC protocols","linear VANET","fading condition","vehicular ad hoc networks","mobile ad hoc networks","MANET","road network safety","node density","vehicle relative speed","wireless media access control protocols","CSMA scheme","ALOHA scheme","attenuation condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VANETs","MAC layer optimization","Aloha","CSMA","simulation","mean density of progress","throughput","attenuation","path loss exponent","fading","rayleigh fading"]}],"abstract":"Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are an important example of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) because they can save lives by improving safety on our road networks. They are difficult to design however due their inherent characteristics e.g., quickly changing topology, node density and relative speeds of vehicles. These characteristics also make current wireless media access control (MAC) protocols unsuitable for use in VANETs without modifications. In this paper we study the performance of these protocols to see how they can be tuned to design a VANET with optimal network throughput. We do a simulation study of two popular MAC schemes (ALOHA and CSMA) in a linear VANET and analyze them in terms of density of progress of the transmissions under different attenuation and fading conditions. The results show how network performance deteriorates with changes in the conditions and how we can improve it by tuning the MAC protocols. The results presented in this paper can be useful for the design and optimal tuning of VANETs in varying network conditions (attenuation, fading and noise).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of MAC protocols in linear VANETs under different attenuation and fading conditions","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309672","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305882/5309513/05309672.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5309513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5309672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5309672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of MAC protocols in linear VANETs under different attenuation and fading conditions","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5309672/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964903","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of MAC protocols in linear VANETs under different attenuation and fading conditions","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065943S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305882","isNumber":"5309513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305882","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5309513","articleId":"5309672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5309696,"authors":[{"name":"Jingxian Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA"],"firstName":"Jingxian","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279160700"},{"name":"Scott C.

This paper discusses the enabling technologies for ultra-low power infrastructure monitoring, and includes a survey on existing ultra-low power infrastructure monitoring technologies. The survey covers both ultra-low power wireless communication technologies, which are usually developed in the form of software, such as protocols and algorithms, and ultra-low power digital hardware design techniques. Traditionally, the communication protocols and hardware are designed in isolation. The isolated design approach fails to capture the interaction between software and hardware or the fundamental tradeoff between communication and computing. We propose a new integrated software-hardware design approach to unify the development process of communication software and hardware. Several new integrated design methods are proposed, and they have the potential to lead to new ultra-low power technologies with power efficiency far beyond existing technologies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305882/5309513/05309696.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5309513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5309696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated software-hardware design for ultra-low power infrastructure monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Isolation technology","Batteries","Condition monitoring","Wireless communication","Communications technology","Wireless application protocol","Software algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","hardware-software codesign","telecommunication computing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated software-hardware design","ultra-low power infrastructure monitoring","ultra-low power computing","ultra-low power wireless communication","ultra-low power digital hardware design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Infrastructure Monitoring","ultra-low power","wireless sensor network","asynchronous digital design","integrated softwarehardware design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5309696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Integrated software-hardware design for ultra-low power infrastructure monitoring","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5309696/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964926","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated software-hardware design for ultra-low power infrastructure monitoring","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059095S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305882","isNumber":"5309513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305882","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5309513","articleId":"5309696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5309698,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Zuther","affiliation":["Group Research & Advanced Engineering, Team Short Range Sensing, Daimler Benz Aerospace, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Zuther","id":"37398512900"},{"name":"Matthias Biggel","affiliation":["Group Research & Advanced Engineering, Team Short Range Sensing, Daimler Benz Aerospace, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Biggel","id":"37671712300"},{"name":"Marc M.

As every sensor has limited resolution, the JPDAM should be used instead of the JPDA algorithm, which does not model the effects of measurement merging. As the JPDAM algorithm is more complicated, these effect are normally neglected for most sensors with good resolution capability. In this paper a new automotive prototypical multi-beam monopulse narrow-band FMCW radar sensor is used. While this sensor has good detection accuracy, it has only limited resolution capability. For this sensor, measurement merging leads to wrong target estimations when not modelled correctly in the multi-target tracking process. While the JPDAM algorithm has already been developed for this case, it can not be applied directly, as it does not model the diminished measurement accuracy when more than one measurement is in the same resolution cell. When using a gating procedure with standard measurement accuracy, the merged measurements will not be associated to the corresponding targets. This motivates the usage of a modified gating method which will be presented in this paper. To reduce the computational demands of the algorithm, a clustering technique for the modified gating procedure is shown. The modified algorithm is tested with real sensor data. The JPDA algorithm and the JPDAM algorithm are both applied to a challenging measurement merging scenario and the results of these algorithms are compared.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5309698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5309698/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964928","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-target tracking for merged measurements of automotive narrow-band radar sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-target tracking for merged measurements of automotive narrow-band radar sensors","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042085S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305882","isNumber":"5309513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305882","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5309513","articleId":"5309698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5309700,"authors":[{"name":"Oswaldo Ludwig Junior","affiliation":["ISR-Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Oswaldo Ludwig","lastName":"Junior","id":"37413035100"},{"name":"David Delgado","affiliation":["ISR-Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Delgado","id":"37666036900"},{"name":"Valter Goncalves","affiliation":["ISR-Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Valter","lastName":"Goncalves","id":"37671901300"},{"name":"Urbano Nunes","affiliation":["ISR-Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Urbano","lastName":"Nunes","id":"37275938400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5519-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5520-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"5309700","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1566},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Feature extraction","Neural networks","Automotive engineering","Covariance matrix","Boosting","Intelligent robots","Intelligent transportation systems","Bayesian methods","Bagging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trainable classifier-fusion scheme","pedestrian detection","learning algorithm","heuristic rules","DaimlerChrysler automotive dataset","feature extractor","syntactic model"]}],"abstract":"This work proposes a novel classifier-fusion scheme using learning algorithms, i.e. syntactic models, instead of the usual Bayesian or heuristic rules.

For example lane departure warning and lane keeping rely on information provided by a lane estimation algorithm. One important step of the lane estimation procedure is the extraction of measurements or detections which can be used to estimate the shape of the road or lane. These detections are generated by white lane markers or the road border itself. Lane estimation has for many years been under heavy development using a gray scale camera. Passive camera based systems can be degraded on its performance under certain circumstances, e.g. at dynamic changes of ambient brightness. The fusion with an active sensor can here increase the robustness of these systems significantly. In this paper an approach is presented to detect lane marks using an active light detection and ranging device (lidar). It can be shown that high reflective lane marks can be reliably detected. A polar lane detector grid is used to combine the distance and intensity measurement channel of the lidar sensor.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309704","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305882/5309513/05309704.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5309513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-channel lidar processing for lane detection and estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Shape measurement","Roads","Cameras","Data mining","Fusion power generation","Degradation","Brightness","Sensor fusion","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","optical radar","radar imaging","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel lidar processing","lane mark detection","lane estimation","lane recognition","driver assistance systems","lane departure warning","lane keeping","measurement extraction","road border","gray scale camera","passive camera-based systems","active sensor fusion","active light detection","polar lane detector grid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5309704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-channel lidar processing for lane detection and estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5309704/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964934","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-channel lidar processing for lane detection and estimation","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036115S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305882","isNumber":"5309513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305882","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5309513","articleId":"5309704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5309845,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Munz","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement, Control, and Microtechnology, University of Ulm (EBS), Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Munz","id":"37545092600"},{"name":"Klaus C.

All interfaces are using probabilistic descriptions of measurement and existence uncertainties. We introduce several extensions to already existing algorithms: the support for association of multiple measurements to the same object is introduced, which reduces the effects of split segments in the data preprocessing step of high-resolution sensors like laser scanners. Furthermore, we present an approach for integrating explicit object birth models. We also developed extensions to speed up the algorithm which lead to real-time performance with fragmented data. We show the application of the framework in an automotive multi-target multi-sensor environment by fusing laser scanner and video. The algorithms were evaluated using real-world data in our research vehicle.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5309513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309845","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305882/5309513/05309845.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sensor independent probabilistic fusion system for driver assistance systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A sensor independent probabilistic fusion system for driver assistance systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5309845/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964954","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5309845/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sensor independent probabilistic fusion system for driver assistance systems","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047601S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305882","isNumber":"5309513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305882","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5309513","articleId":"5309845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5309875,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Gritsch","affiliation":["Department Safety & Security, Business Unit Neuroinformatics, Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Gritsch","id":"37285162800"},{"name":"Nikolaus Donath","affiliation":["Department Safety & Security, Business Unit Neuroinformatics, Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Nikolaus","lastName":"Donath","id":"37660153300"},{"name":"Bernhard Kohn","affiliation":["Department Safety & Security, Business Unit Neuroinformatics, Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Kohn","id":"38260963200"},{"name":"Martin Litzenberger","affiliation":["Department Safety & Security, Business Unit Neuroinformatics, Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Litzenberger","id":"37332024400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5519-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5520-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"5309875","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":540},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Machine vision","Sensor arrays","Optical sensors","Testing","Radar detection","Detectors","Sensor systems","Neuromorphics","Sensor phenomena and characterization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","night vision","optical sensors","traffic engineering computing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["night-time vehicle classification","embedded vision system","optical transient sensor","neuromorphic sensor","data-driven address-event representation format","video annotation","ultrasonic/radar-combination reference detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic Control","Public Transportation Management","Imaging and Image Analysis"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents night-time vehicle classification using an embedded vision system based on an optical transient sensor. This neuromorphic sensor features an array of 128times128 pixels that respond to relative light intensity changes with low latency and high dynamic range. The proposed algorithm exploits the temporal resolution and sparse representation of the data, delivered by the sensor in the data-driven address-event representation (AER) format, to efficiently implement a robust classification of vehicles into two classes, car-like and truck-like, during night-time operation. The classification is based on the extraction of the positions and distances of the vehicles head lights to estimate vehicle width. We present the algorithm, test data and an evaluation of the classification accuracy by comparison of the test data with ground truth from video annotation and reference results from a state-of-the-art ultrasonic/radar-combination reference detector. The results show that the difference in total truck counts with respect to a reference detector and to manually annotated video during nighttime operation under dry and wet road conditions is typically below 6%.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309875","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305882/5309513/05309875.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5309513","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Night-time vehicle classification with an embedded, vision system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5309875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Night-time vehicle classification with an embedded, vision system","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5309875/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964871","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5309875/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Night-time vehicle classification with an embedded, vision system","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047283S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305882","isNumber":"5309513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305882","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5309513","articleId":"5309875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
