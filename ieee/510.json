These oscillations are mainly observed in cortical regions and also occur in neocortical and subcortical areas and the hippocampus. In this paper, we investigate the influence of acute exposure to 2-Aminoethoxy-Diphenylborate (2-APB). Our central hypothesis is that acute exposure to 2-APB significantly reduces the hippocampal gamma oscillations. In order to test this hypothesis, we use brain-slice recordings and the advanced nonlinear dynamical analysis method based on the Lempel-Ziv estimator. Our nonlinear dynamical analysis from brain slice recording results suggested that 2-APB exposure significantly reduces the hippocampal gamma oscillations.","doi":"10.1109/NER.2009.5109269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NER.2009.5109269","startPage":"203","endPage":"206","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075461/5109209/05109269.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamics of hippocampal \u03b3 oscillations in rats in response to acute 2-APB exposure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of hippocampal \u03b3 oscillations in rats in response to acute 2-APB exposure","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109269/","accessionNumber":"10747167","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109269/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of hippocampal \u03b3 oscillations in rats in response to acute 2-APB exposure","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"051_3415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042716S","chronDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075461","isNumber":"5109209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075461","xplore-issue":"5109209","articleId":"5109269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5109276,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The second classifier, which is based on the imagination of left-hand movement is designed for error correction and activating the first classifier. One important issue in developing an on-line BCI is the robust and accurate classification of EEG signal which is characterized with a time-varying distribution. In this work, we present a real-time recurrent probabilistic neural network for classifying the EEG signals.

The objective of this study is to design a brain interface system that requires very few channels, has a zero false activation rate and a high true activation rate. To attain this objective, a brain-computer interface that is EEG-based and that is activated by mental tasks is proposed. The system is custom designed for each subject. For each subject, the most discriminatory mental task that yields a zero false activation rate is determined. By keeping the false positive rate at zero, the number of channels needed is reduced. We show that we can obtain a false positive rate of zero value and a true positive rate in the range of 71.96% to 77.61% with only three electrode channels. The dataset used was not collected in a self-paced paradigm; however, it is employed to show that the design of a self-paced interface is feasible. EEG signals of four subjects performing five mental tasks are used as data. Applying fast and simple approaches like the autoregressive modeling and the quadratic discriminant analysis as the feature extraction and classification methods, respectively, is another advantage of the present work.","doi":"10.1109/NER.2009.5109318","startPage":"403","endPage":"406","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075461/5109209/05109318.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NER.2009.5109318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a mental task-based brain-computer interface with a zero false activation rate using very few EEG electrode channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Brain computer interfaces","Electroencephalography","Electrodes","Computer interfaces","Brain modeling","Multiple sclerosis","Neural engineering","Feature extraction","Synchronous motors","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","biomedical electrodes","brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","feature extraction","medical signal processing","psychology","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interface system","zero false activation rate","EEG electrode channel","discriminatory mental task","self-paced paradigm","EEG signal","autoregressive modeling","quadratic discriminant analysis","feature extraction","classification method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["brain-computer interface","BCI","mental task","custom design","EEG","false activation rate","autoregressive modeling","quadratic discriminant analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of a mental task-based brain-computer interface with a zero false activation rate using very few EEG electrode channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109318/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10733403","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a mental task-based brain-computer interface with a zero false activation rate using very few EEG electrode channels","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"101_0660.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05092S","chronDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075461","isNumber":"5109209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075461","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5109209","articleId":"5109318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5109319,"authors":[{"name":"Farzad Asgarian","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, K.N.

Since implantable electronics have strict requirements on area and power, spike detection must be as power- and area-efficient as possible. In this paper, we examine whether analog or digital spike detection is more efficient. The motivation behind an analog implementation for detection is to save the power spent to quantize the input samples, which has an exponential dependence on the bit resolution. From our analysis using 90-nm technology, we find that digital implementations are more efficient for lower resolutions (up to 8 or 9 bits), whereas analog implementations are more power-efficient for higher resolutions. This conclusion is found to be valid across a wide range of SNRs and neuronal firing rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10747210","htmlLink":"/document/5109323/","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"An efficiency comparison of analog and digital spike detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficiency comparison of analog and digital spike detection","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"106_3598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055337S","chronDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075461","isNumber":"5109209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075461","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5109209","articleId":"5109323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5109337,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Citi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Citi","id":"37394444200"},{"name":"Riccardo Poli","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Poli","id":"37444709300"},{"name":"Caterina Cinel","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"firstName":"Caterina","lastName":"Cinel","id":"37573041600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2072-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2073-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3554"}],"articleNumber":"5109337","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"abstract":"The P300 is an endogenous component of EEG event related potentials which is elicited by rare and significant stimuli. P300s are used increasingly frequently in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) because, being naturally elicited in response to external stimuli, users do not need special training. However, P300 waves are hard to detect and, therefore, multiple stimulus presentations are needed before an interface can make a reliable decision. While significant improvements have been made in the detection of P300s, no particular attention has been paid to the variability in shape and timing of P300 waves and its exploitation in BCI. In this paper we start filling this gap, by first documenting and then exploiting a modulation in amplitude of P300 caused by target-to-target interval (TTI) differences. We demonstrate this within the context of the Donchin's speller, which is perhaps the best known example of a BCI system relying on the detection P300 waves, where target-to-target interval variations are induced by stimuli randomisation. In particular we show that by specialising detectors to work with P300s elicited with each TTI, we can further improve the performance of the best known Donchin's speller with minimal changes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Enterprise resource planning","Electroencephalography","Shape","Timing","Brain computer interfaces","Delay","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Neural engineering","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["P300 amplitude variation","Donchins BCI speller","EEG event related potential","brain computer interface","multiple stimulus presentation","P300 wave detection","target-to-target interval difference","external stimuli randomisation","signal classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NER.2009.5109337","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075461/5109209/05109337.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NER.2009.5109337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting P300 amplitude variations can improve classification accuracy in Donchin's BCI speller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting P300 amplitude variations can improve classification accuracy in Donchin's BCI speller","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109337/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109337/","accessionNumber":"10747221","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting P300 amplitude variations can improve classification accuracy in Donchin's BCI speller","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"120_8359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060204S","chronDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075461","isNumber":"5109209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075461","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5109209","articleId":"5109337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5109346,"authors":[{"name":"Catherine Stamoulis","affiliation":["Harvard Medical School, Department of Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Stamoulis","id":"38497017100"},{"name":"Bernard S.

Surgical intervention is not possible in these cases as it is difficult to isolate the epileptogenic foci. Scalp EEG signals recorded during such seizures include coupled contributions from different sources. If it was possible to decouple these contributions based on differences in both their signatures and inter-arrival times at different electrodes, it would subsequently be possible to estimate the locations of the seizure foci. For this purpose, we applied matched filtering to scalp EEG data from 3 patients with multifocal seizures, using patient-specific source-related short EEG segments as the template waveforms. These segments were assumed to be seizure-related based on distinct sets of inter-arrival times at different channels and alternating signal polarities. We present preliminary results and demonstrate that matched filtering can be successfully applied to extract decoupled signal components from the EEG, generated by potentially distinct sources, and thus with distinct inter-arrival times but partially overlapping spectra.","doi":"10.1109/NER.2009.5109346","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","startPage":"514","endPage":"517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NER.2009.5109346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109209","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075461/5109209/05109346.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Feature extraction","Frequency","Filtering","Scalp","Matched filters","Epilepsy","Muscles","Nervous system","Surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","electroencephalography","feature extraction","matched filters","medical disorders","medical signal processing","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched-filtering application","EEG feature extraction","decouple signal contribution extraction","brain malformation","multiple seizure foci","medical electrode","patient related EEG segments","matched filtering channel waveform","inter-arrival time overlapping spectra","electroencephalography","epileptogenic foci","scalp EEG signal recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of matched-filtering to extract EEG features and decouple signal contributions from multiple seizure foci in brain malformations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109346/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109346/","accessionNumber":"10747227","isStaticHtml":true,"pubMedId":"20436686","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of matched-filtering to extract EEG features and decouple signal contributions from multiple seizure foci in brain malformations","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"129_2232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079732S","chronDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075461","isNumber":"5109209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075461","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5109209","articleId":"5109346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5109350,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The network consists of principal cells (pyramidal neurons) and local interneurons and uses GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. For pyramidal cells, this paper introduces a novel two-compartment model that was developed using published data and our own experimental data (intracellular recordings, in vitro). For interneurons, single-compartment models published elsewhere were implemented. The forward problem was solved to calculate the local field potential generated by the network. Our results show that: i) the dasiareducedpsila model approach allows for simulations including a relatively large number of cells, ii) for appropriate changes in model-parameters (related to synaptic transmission), the model can generate ldquospikerdquo events that closely resemble actual epileptic spikes and iii) some features of spike shape (amplitude, duration) can be explained by the degree of excitatory and inhibitory drive to pyramidal cells.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109350/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10733413","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109350/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","conferenceDate":"29 April-2 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interpretation of intracerebral-EEG epileptic spikes from detailed modeling of neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpretation of intracerebral-EEG epileptic spikes from detailed modeling of neural networks","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"133_1533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060312S","chronDate":"April 29 2009-May 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075461","isNumber":"5109209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075461","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5109209","articleId":"5109350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5109386,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Hu","affiliation":["Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37290867200"},{"name":"Keith DK Luk","affiliation":["Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Keith DK","lastName":"Luk","id":"37367301500"},{"name":"Hongyan Cui","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Hongyan Cui","id":"37308169200"},{"name":"Xiaobo Xie","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Xie","id":"37307108300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2072-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2073-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3554"}],"articleNumber":"5109386","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface somatosensory evoked potential detection by FPGA based multi-adaptive filter","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075461/5109209/05109386.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"676","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NER.2009.5109386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109209","doi":"10.1109/NER.2009.5109386","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Signal processing algorithms","Electrodes","Noise cancellation","Data acquisition","Biomedical measurements","Data mining","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","bioelectric potentials","biomedical electronics","biomedical measurement","field programmable gate arrays","medical disorders","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","somatosensory phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface somatosensory evoked potential detection","FPGA-based multiadaptive filter","SSEP extraction","fixed-point adaptive noise canceller","neurological abnormal patient","FPGA-based ANC technique","SSEP measurement time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["somatosensory evoked potentials","adaptive noise canceller","fixed-point"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109386","abstract":"Surface somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) collected from conscious subjects usually presents poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), requiring several hundreds ensembles averaging to provide a meaningful waveform.

By contrast, spectrum assigned to the private sector is usually most heavily used in urban areas. The second generation of government spectrum sharing started in 2004 with cognitive-radio-based sharing of the 5.25-5.35 and 5.47-5.725 GHz radar bands by unlicensed Wi-Fi-like systems. This sharing is called dynamic frequency selection (DFS) in regulatory and standards publications. Although DFS enabled sharing, the technical criteria were very conservative due to the fact that the military radar systems were not designed for sharing and the fact that interference to these radar systems had to be kept to a negligible likelihood.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sharing government spectrum with private users: opportunities and challenges","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2009.5109457","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5109453/05109457.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2009.5109457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109453","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Sharing government spectrum with private users: opportunities and challenges","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5109457/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731410","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sharing government spectrum with private users: opportunities and challenges","sourcePdf":"004LYT-SPECTRUM-June.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024576S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5109453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5109453","articleId":"5109457","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5109469,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet C.

The technique can efficiently trade off image quality and computation energy. Based on sensitivity differences of 64 DCT coefficients, separate operand bit-widths are used for different frequency components to reduce computation energy. To select the appropriate operand bit-widths that achieve significant reduction of power consumption with minimum image quality degradation, we also propose a bit-width selection algorithm. The proposed variable bit precision DCT algorithm can be efficiently implemented using carry save adder trees. The reconfigurable DCT architecture can achieve power savings ranging from 36% to 75% compared to normal operation at the expense of minor image quality degradation.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2016839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5453312/05109472.pdf","startPage":"787","endPage":"793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5453312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2016839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Bit-Width Adaptation in DCT: An Approach to Trade Off Image Quality and Computation Energy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Bit-Width Adaptation in DCT: An Approach to Trade Off Image Quality and Computation Energy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109472/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11260229","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109472/","volume":"18","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Bit-Width Adaptation in DCT: An Approach to Trade Off Image Quality and Computation Energy","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-park-2016839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065742S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5453312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5453312","articleId":"5109472","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5109474,"authors":[{"name":"Kyu Hwan An","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Kyu Hwan","lastName":"An","id":"37305827000"},{"name":"Dong Ho Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280602500"},{"name":"Ockgoo Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ockgoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37266832400"},{"name":"Hyungwook Kim","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Hyungwook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37310769700"},{"name":"Jeonghu Han","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeonghu","lastName":"Han","id":"37308388700"},{"name":"Woonyun Kim","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Woonyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37536466800"},{"name":"Chang-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Design Center, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chang-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280404200"},{"name":"Haksun Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electro Mechanics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Haksun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292767500"},{"name":"Joy Laskar","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Joy","lastName":"Laskar","id":"37280282800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5109474","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2144},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power control","Power generation","CMOS process","Wireless LAN","Power supplies","WiMAX","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","low-power electronics","power control","power transformers","UHF power amplifiers","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully-integrated linear CMOS power amplifier","discrete power control","parallel-combining transformer","gate bias adaptation","power back-off","low-output power","WLAN","WiMAX","frequency 2.4 GHz","size 0.18 mum","voltage 3.3 V","efficiency 33 percent","current 650 mA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bias control","CMOS","discrete power control","power amplifier","power combining","transformer"]}],"abstract":"A fully integrated 2.4 GHz CMOS power amplifier (PA) in a standard 0.18 mum CMOS process is presented.

Conventional receivers for most broadcasting or wireless standards preset the channel length to the maximal expected duration of the channel impulse response for the adopted channel estimation and equalization algorithms. The excessive channel length often significantly increases the implementational complexity of the wireless receivers and leads to the redundant information which would induce the additional estimation errors. Moreover, such a scheme does not allow the dynamic memory allocation for variable channel lengths. This could further increase the power consumption and reduce the battery life of a mobile device. The knowledge of the actual channel length would, in principle, help the system designers decrease the complexity of the channel estimators using maximum likelihood (ML) and minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) algorithms. In this paper, we address this important channel length estimation problem and propose a novel autocorrelation-based algorithm to estimate the channel length without the need of pilots or training sequence. The associated threshold for the channel length estimation depends on the sample size, the signal-to-noise ratio and the leading/last channel coefficients. In addition, we provide the mean-square analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed non-pilot-aided channel length estimator through Monte Carlo simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5210245/05109503.pdf","startPage":"633","endPage":"641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2009.2023201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2009.2023201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Non-Pilot-Aided Channel Length Estimation for Digital Broadcasting Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Channel estimation","Estimation error","Energy consumption","Batteries","Algorithm design and analysis","Autocorrelation","Signal to noise ratio","Broadcasting","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","Monte Carlo methods","receivers","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["non-pilot-aided channel length estimation","digital broadcasting receivers","channel impulse response","maximum likelihood algorithm","c-error algorithm","training sequence","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind identification","broadcasting systems","mean-square analysis","non-pilot-aided channel length estimation.","second-order statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Non-Pilot-Aided Channel Length Estimation for Digital Broadcasting Receivers","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5109503/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840314","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Non-Pilot-Aided Channel Length Estimation for Digital Broadcasting Receivers","sourcePdf":"tbc-wu-2023201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112534S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5210245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5210245","articleId":"5109503","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109508,"authors":[{"name":"Keith R.

The AUV is modeled as a nonholonomic system as any lateral motion of a conventional, slender AUV is quickly damped out. The problem is formulated as an optimal kinematic control problem on the Euclidean Group of Motions \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SE</i>\n(3) , where the cost function to be minimized is equal to the integral of a quadratic function of the velocity components. An application of the maximum principle to this optimal control problem yields the appropriate Hamiltonian and the corresponding vector fields give the necessary conditions for optimality. For a special case of the cost function, the necessary conditions for optimality can be characterized more easily and we proceed to investigate its solutions. Finally, it is shown that a particular set of optimal motions trace helical paths. Throughout this note we highlight a particular case where the quadratic cost function is weighted in such a way that it equates to the Lagrangian (kinetic energy) of the AUV. For this case, the regular extremal curves are constrained to equate to the AUV's components of momentum and the resulting vector fields are the d'Alembert-Lagrange equations in Hamiltonian form.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2009.2017966","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5159545/05109515.pdf","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1626","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2009.2017966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Kinematic Control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Kinematic Control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle","volume":"54","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774682","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5109515/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Kinematic Control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle","sourcePdf":"54tac06-jbiggs-2017966.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05052S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5159545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5159545","articleId":"5109515","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5109519,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Mercier","affiliation":["Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5170200/5109519/5109519-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pascal Mercier received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering in 2006 from McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering in 2008 from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.","His areas of interest are in energy storage, power system simulation and optimization, and electricity market deregulation."]},"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Mercier","id":"37584886300"},{"name":"Rachid Cherkaoui","affiliation":["Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5170200/5109519/5109519-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Rachid Cherkaoui (M'05\u2013SM'07) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1983 and 1992, respectively.","He is now a Senior Research Engineer at EPFL, LRE.

The sample used a triplet-based cabling pattern in one leg and a septuplet-based in the other. The legs had different cabling pattern and strand diameters, but the same void fraction. To assure the accuracy in measurement of the conductor current sharing temperature, it is important to have uniform current distribution in the cable, which requires uniformly low interstrand resistivity in the joint. In the present sample, the cable/subcable wraps and the chrome plating on all strands were removed from the cable in the termination, followed by compacting and heat treating the termination in a Glidcop sleeve. To improve current transfer, the sintered termination was further filled with soft solder before it was soldered to the copper profile. To clarify the effectiveness of short sample instrumentation, the sample was equipped with enhanced number of sensors and with sensor mounts penetrating the conductor jacket for the thermometers and voltage taps positioned in the high field zone. This paper presents the experiences in sample fabrication and instrumentation, and outlines the parameters used in the key processes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2009.2018203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied

In this paper we devise a recursive track-managed filter via a quantized state-space (\u201cbin\u201d) model. In the limit, as the discretization implied by the bins becomes as refined as possible (infinitesimal bins) we find that the filter equations are identical to Mahler's probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, a novel track- managed filtering scheme that is attracting increasing attention. Thus, one contribution of this paper is an interpretation of, if not the PHD itself, at least what the PHD is doing. This does offer some intuitive appeal, but has some practical use as well: with this model it is possible to identify the PHD's \u201ctarget-death\u201d problem, and also the statistical inference structures of the PHD filters. To obviate the target death problem, PHD originator Mahler developed a new \u201ccardinalized\u201d version of PHD (CPHD). The second contribution of this paper is to extend the \u201cbin-occupancy\u201d model such that the resulting recursive filter is identical to the cardinalized PHD filter. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5286803/05109630.pdf","startPage":"4232","endPage":"4246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Bin-Occupancy Filter and Its Connection to the PHD Filters","volume":"57","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918055","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109630/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Bin-Occupancy Filter and Its Connection to the PHD Filters","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-pwillett-2025816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044824S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"76","articleId":"5109630","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-20"},{"_id":5109632,"authors":[{"name":"Chengwen Xing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chengwen","lastName":"Xing","id":"37392522900"},{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shaodan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37280187300"},{"name":"Yik-Chung Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yik-Chung","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281222900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5109632","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":628},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Array signal processing","Covariance matrix","Sensor arrays","Iterative algorithms","Uncertainty","Microphone arrays","Signal processing","Closed-form solution","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity robust beamforming","positive semidefinite constraints","general-rank signal models","norm bounded uncertainties","signal covariance matrices","minimum variance robust beamformers","iterative algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust beamforming","convex optimization","positive semidefinite constraint","minimax"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of robust beamforming for general-rank signal models with norm bounded uncertainties in the desired and received signal covariance matrices as well as positive semidefinite constraints on the covariance matrices.

This paper looks at greedy algorithms that are applicable to very large problems. The main contribution is the development of a new selection strategy (called stagewise weak selection) that effectively selects several elements in each iteration. The new selection strategy is based on the realization that many classical proofs for recovery of sparse signals can be trivially extended to the new setting. What is more, simulation studies show the computational benefits and good performance of the approach. This strategy can be used in several greedy algorithms, and we argue for the use within the gradient pursuit framework in which selected coefficients are updated using a conjugate update direction. For this update, we present a fast implementation and novel convergence result.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5286803/05109633.pdf","startPage":"4333","endPage":"4346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stagewise Weak Gradient Pursuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109633/","displayDocTitle":"Stagewise Weak Gradient Pursuits","volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918048","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109633/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stagewise Weak Gradient Pursuits","sourcePdf":"57tsp10-tblumensath-2025088.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089385S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5286803","articleId":"5109633","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5109636,"authors":[{"name":"Jos A.

To realize transceivers targeted for these applications, it is essential to understand the body area propagation channel. Several numerical, simulated, and measured body area propagation studies have recently been conducted. While many of these studies are useful for evaluating communication systems, they are not compared against or justified by more fundamental physical models derived from basic principles. This type of comparison is necessary to provide better physical insights into expected propagation trends and to justify modeling choices. To address this problem, we have developed a simple and generic body area propagation model derived directly from Maxwell's equations revealing basic propagation trends away, inside, around, and along the body. We have verified the resulting analytical model by comparing it with measurements in an anechoic chamber. This paper develops an analytical model of the body, describes the expected body area pathloss trends predicted by Maxwell's equations, and compares it with measurements of the electric field close to the body.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Body Area Propagation Model Derived From Fundamental Principles: Analytical Analysis and Comparison With Measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2025786","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5405121/05109638.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2025786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5405121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Body Area Propagation Model Derived From Fundamental Principles: Analytical Analysis and Comparison With Measurements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5109638/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11118413","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Body Area Propagation Model Derived From Fundamental Principles: Analytical Analysis and Comparison With Measurements","sourcePdf":"tap-fort-2025786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079895S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5405121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5405121","articleId":"5109638","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109640,"authors":[{"name":"Jose-Maria Molina-Garcia-Pardo","affiliation":["Departamento de Technologias de ka Informaci\u00f3n y la Comunicaciones, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose-Maria","lastName":"Molina-Garcia-Pardo","id":"37267388300"},{"name":"Martine Lienard","affiliation":["Telecommunications Interferences and Electromagnetic Compatibility TELICE Institut dElectronique, University of Lille (USTL), Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Martine","lastName":"Lienard","id":"37277919400"},{"name":"Pierre Degauque","affiliation":["Telecommunications Interferences and Electromagnetic Compatibility TELICE Institut dElectronique, University of Lille (USTL), Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Degauque","id":"37277935200"},{"name":"Eric Simon","affiliation":["Telecommunications Interferences and Electromagnetic Compatibility TELICE Institut dElectronique, University of Lille (USTL), Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Simon","id":"37285031500"},{"name":"Leandro Juan-Llacer","affiliation":["Departamento de Technologias de ka Informaci\u00f3n y la Comunicaciones, Technical University Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"Juan-Llacer","id":"38260182200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5109640","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel capacity","Linear antenna arrays","Scattering","Electromagnetic waveguides","Wireless communication","Error analysis","Rail transportation","Cutoff frequency","Attenuation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","tunnels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channel","channel capacity","multiple-input multiple-output channels","wireless channels","rectangular-shaped tunnels","receiving arrays","transmitting arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity","modal theory","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","propagation channel","tunnel"]}],"abstract":"This communication deals with the problem of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels in rectangular-shaped tunnels.

Therefore, the capacity which can be practically achieved, either with optimized linear arrays or with uniform linear arrays, is discussed in the second part of this communication and compared to the results of the reference scenario.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On MIMO Channel Capacity in Tunnels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2025899","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5308576/05109640.pdf","startPage":"3697","endPage":"3701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2025899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308576","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109640/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"On MIMO Channel Capacity in Tunnels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10958104","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On MIMO Channel Capacity in Tunnels","sourcePdf":"tap-molinagarciapardo-2025899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035178S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","isNumber":"5308576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"9","articleId":"5109640","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109651,"authors":[{"name":"Mehul P.

The key idea behind CW-SSIM is that certain image distortions lead to consistent phase changes in the local wavelet coefficients, and that a consistent phase shift of the coefficients does not change the structural content of the image. By conducting four case studies, we have demonstrated the superiority of the CW-SSIM index against other indices (e.g., Dice, Hausdorff distance) commonly used for assessing the similarity of a given pair of images. In addition, we show that the CW-SSIM index has a number of advantages. It is robust to small rotations and translations. It provides useful comparisons even without a preprocessing image registration step, which is essential for other indices. Moreover, it is computationally less expensive.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex Wavelet Structural Similarity: A New Image Similarity Index","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2025923","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5286712/05109651.pdf","startPage":"2385","endPage":"2401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2025923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109651/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Complex Wavelet Structural Similarity: A New Image Similarity Index","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5109651/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918094","pubMedId":"19556195","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex Wavelet Structural Similarity: A New Image Similarity Index","sourcePdf":"18tip10-msampat-2025923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107463S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5286712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"329","xplore-issue":"5286712","articleId":"5109651","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5109654,"authors":[{"name":"Song Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292845300"},{"name":"Jonathan H.

To retrieve transmitted data correctly, reliable estimation of time-dispersive channels is important. This letter develops an improved cross-relation (CR) based blind SIMO-OFDM channel estimation method in the frequency domain. The significance of the proposed algorithm is twofold. First, it is highly data-efficient in that the SIMO-OFDM channels can be blindly identified using a single received data block. Second, the proposed method only requires an upper bound rather than the exact knowledge of the channel length. Simulation results show that the new method performs favorably compared to the existing CR- and subspace-based methods.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2025926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5170191/05109654.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2025926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170191","startPage":"865","endPage":"868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cross-Relation-Based Frequency-Domain Method for Blind SIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Cross-Relation-Based Frequency-Domain Method for Blind SIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10812332","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5109654/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cross-Relation-Based Frequency-Domain Method for Blind SIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"16lsp10-swang-2025926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083816S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5170191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5170191","articleId":"5109654","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109655,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammand Narimani","affiliation":["Division of Engineering, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Mohammand","lastName":"Narimani","id":"37398691100"},{"name":"H.

The second approach is named as the regional-membership-function-shape-dependent approach in which the operating region is partitioned to subregions, and the boundary information of membership functions on each operating subregion is employed to facilitate the stability analysis. In both approaches, by the help of the boundary and/or regional information of the membership functions, some inequality constraints in the form of multidimensional fuzzy summation containing some slack matrices are constructed. Stability conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stability conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relaxed LMI-Based Stability Conditions for Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Control Systems Using Regional-Membership-Function-Shape-Dependent Analysis Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2025959","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5272826/05109655.pdf","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2025959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Relaxed LMI-Based Stability Conditions for Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Control Systems Using Regional-Membership-Function-Shape-Dependent Analysis Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5109655/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10891906","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relaxed LMI-Based Stability Conditions for Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Control Systems Using Regional-Membership-Function-Shape-Dependent Analysis Approach","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-narimani-2025959.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080676S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5272826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5272826","articleId":"5109655","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109656,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Ojaroudi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Ojaroudi","id":"37397100300"},{"name":"Changiz Ghobadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Changiz","lastName":"Ghobadi","id":"37277361200"},{"name":"Javad Nourinia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Javad","lastName":"Nourinia","id":"37277358500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5109656","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":147,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2303},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband antennas","Bandwidth","Broadband antennas","Microstrip antennas","Ultra wideband technology","Frequency","Geometry","Impedance","Antenna feeds","Loaded antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","monopole antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small square monopole antenna","inverted T-shaped notch","ground plane","UWB","ultrawideband","square radiating patch"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverted T-shaped notch","square monopole antenna","ultrawideband (UWB)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small Square Monopole Antenna With Inverted T-Shaped Notch in the Ground Plane for UWB Application","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2009.2025972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808186","endPage":"731","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4808186/05109656.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2009.2025972","startPage":"728","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109656","abstract":"In this letter, we present a novel printed monopole antenna for ultrawideband (UWB) applications.

The leaf litter and soil samples, numbered 1 and 2, were obtained from a site located in the savanna biome of South Africa (Skukuza: 25.0deg S, 31.5deg E). A third soil sample, number 3, was obtained from Etosha Pan, Namibia (19.20deg S, 15.93deg E, altitude of 1100 m). In addition, BRDF of local fresh and dry leaves from tulip polar tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black locust tree (Robinia pseudoacacia) were studied. It is shown how the BRDF depends on the incident and scatter angles, sample size (i.e., crushed versus whole leaf), soil samples fraction size, sample status (i.e., fresh versus dry leaves), vegetation species (i.e., poplar versus locust), and the vegetation's biochemical composition. As a demonstration of the application of the results of this paper, airborne BRDF measurements acquired with NASA's Cloud Absorption Radiometer over the same general site where the soil and leaf-litter samples were obtained are compared to the laboratory results. Good agreement between laboratory and airborne-measured BRDF is reported.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2021331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2021331","startPage":"2546","endPage":"2556","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5165149/05109658.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BRDF Analysis of Savanna Vegetation and Salt-Pan Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"BRDF Analysis of Savanna Vegetation and Salt-Pan Samples","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","volume":"47","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109658/","accessionNumber":"10764037","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109658/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BRDF Analysis of Savanna Vegetation and Salt-Pan Samples","sourcePdf":"tgrs-georgev-2021331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052433S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5165149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5165149","articleId":"5109658","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5109667,"authors":[{"name":"Chowarit Mitsantisuk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/5109667/5109667-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chowarit Mitsantisuk (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand, in 2003 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering.","His research interests include motion control, force control, human\u2013robot interaction, sensor fusion, and real-world haptics."]},"firstName":"Chowarit","lastName":"Mitsantisuk","id":"37393971800"},{"name":"Seiichiro Katsura","affiliation":["Department of System Design Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/5109667/5109667-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Seiichiro Katsura (S'03\u2013M'04) received the B.E. degree in system design engineering and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in integrated design engineering from Keio University, Yokohama, Japan, in 2001, 2002, and 2004, respectively.","From 2004 to 2005, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Keio University.

Moreover, a consideration of the dynamic properties of human operators is also important for the human application. According to such requirements, this paper presents a novel sensorless force control approach for the robot-assisted motion of the human arm. A twin direct-drive motor system with a wire rope has been developed to provide a precise force sensation and safety for human-robot interaction. In order to control the wire rope tension and human interaction force, two mode designs of the force control are realized. The common mode is utilized for the control of wire rope tension. In the differential mode, the Kalman-filter-based sensor integration for the interaction force observer is proposed in this paper. By combining two motor encoders and a commercial acceleration sensor together, white Gaussian noise is reduced, and high accurate feedback of the contact force is obtained. A variable power assist control method based on a real-time estimation of the stiffness of the human arm is also introduced. By considering the stiffness in human arm movements, this method increases the efficiency of the force control system and realizes comfortable force for human-robot interaction. The effectiveness of the method is verified by experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kalman-Filter-Based Sensor Integration of Variable Power Assist Control Based on Human Stiffness Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2025294","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/05109667.pdf","startPage":"3897","endPage":"3905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2025294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Kalman-Filter-Based Sensor Integration of Variable Power Assist Control Based on Human Stiffness Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5109667/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869425","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman-Filter-Based Sensor Integration of Variable Power Assist Control Based on Human Stiffness Estimation","sourcePdf":"tie-mitsantisuk-2025294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07148S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"5109667","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109670,"authors":[{"name":"Amirhossein Ghazisaeidi","affiliation":["The ECE Department, COPL, Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5153550/5109670/5109670-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amirhossein Ghazisaeidi received the M.A. degree in communications systems and the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

Here, we introduce the virtual gain arising from the unavoidable spatial nonlinear variation, which helps to obtain the self-similar parabolic pulses at smaller optimum length in comparison to NDDF with constant nonlinearity. The output power profiles resemble with a perfect parabolic shape giving rise to self-similar pulses with very small misfit parameters. Pulse propagation in presence of spatial gain variation is also studied. To avoid fabrication difficulties, we propose equivalent staircase dispersion profiles consisting of a number of constant dispersion fibers (CDFs), which are simple to manufacture and show performances excellently close to that of the proposed NDDF.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5196856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2020439","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5196856/05109680.pdf","startPage":"3880","endPage":"3887","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2020439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of Self-Similar Parabolic Pulses by Designing Normal Dispersion Decreasing Fiber Amplifier as Well as Its Staircase Substitutes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Generation of Self-Similar Parabolic Pulses by Designing Normal Dispersion Decreasing Fiber Amplifier as Well as Its Staircase Substitutes","volume":"27","issue":"17","htmlLink":"/document/5109680/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10836771","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of Self-Similar Parabolic Pulses by Designing Normal Dispersion Decreasing Fiber Amplifier as Well as Its Staircase Substitutes","sourcePdf":"jlt-mbasu-2020439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065036S","chronDate":"Sept.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5196856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5196856","articleId":"5109680","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5109682,"authors":[{"name":"Fazal U.

This power-split hybrid system has inherent low damping in driveline since it uses planetary gear sets to directly connect the engine, the generator, and the motor to the driveline for improved vehicle efficiency, thus lacking a clutch or a torque converter that provides the conventional vehicles with driveline damping. When they are subjected to acceleration or disturbances, the low damping in the driveline may cause torsional vibrations. Since the power-split control system is closed loop in nature, these torsional vibrations can result in sustained driveline oscillations. These oscillations can be very objectionable to the driver as they affect the vehicle's drivability. In this paper, we present the design of an active damping wheel-torque control system to suppress such oscillations to improve the drivability of a power-split HEV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported use of an active damping wheel-torque control system to suppress the driveline oscillations in a power-split HEV. Simulations in a power-split HEV environment and experimental tests in the field using a Ford Escape Hybrid demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in suppressing the oscillations. The driveline disturbances are suppressed to below the perceptible level of wheel torque (<100 Nmiddotm). Additional simulations are performed to validate the system to other key factors that can affect its performance. Even with increased motor/generator disturbances by a factor of 2 and change in driveline stiffness of plusmn50%, the proposed control system can still effectively suppress driveline oscillations and thereby improve drivability.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2025953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05109682.pdf","startPage":"4769","endPage":"4785","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2025953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Damping Wheel-Torque Control System to Reduce Driveline Oscillations in a Power-Split Hybrid Electric Vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Active Damping Wheel-Torque Control System to Reduce Driveline Oscillations in a Power-Split Hybrid Electric Vehicle","volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5109682/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966670","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Damping Wheel-Torque Control System to Reduce Driveline Oscillations in a Power-Split Hybrid Electric Vehicle","sourcePdf":"tvt-ying-2025953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083965S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5109682","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":5109685,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Y.

Our approach is based on the minimization of the vector error rate at the destination subject to individual power constraints at the source and the relay. For the single-user case, we propose a joint max-min power-loading strategy that is optimal at large signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and in doing so, we show how the original problem may be recast into an effective (no-relay) OFDM power-loading problem with a previously known solution. Using bounds on effective SNRs, we propose disjoint power-loading strategies that require channel state information either at the source or at the relay but not at both. For the multicast scenario, we propose a max-min equalizing solution that yields a minimum effective SNR at each user terminal. We also formulate several linear solutions based on prioritizing the users in the network. Our single-user simulations show considerable error-rate performance gains for the proposed joint max-min solution and gives hints as to where disjoint power loading is the most effective. Our multicast simulations show that the max-min equalizing solution is best suited for networks with random user locations, whereas the linear prioritizing solutions work best for networks with fixed user locations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05109685.pdf","startPage":"4890","endPage":"4902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2025954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2025954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-User and Multicast OFDM Power Loading With Nonregenerative Relaying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency division multiplexing","Power system relaying","Digital relays","Digital audio broadcasting","Radio broadcasting","TV broadcasting","Error analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","equalisers","minimax techniques","multicast communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast OFDM power loading strategy","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","nonregenerative relaying","channel state information","max-min equalizing solution","error-rate performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicast","nonregenerative relay","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","power loading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Single-User and Multicast OFDM Power Loading With Nonregenerative Relaying","volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5109685/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966665","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-User and Multicast OFDM Power Loading With Nonregenerative Relaying","sourcePdf":"tvt-panah-2025954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098915S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5109685","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109686,"authors":[{"name":"Massimiliano Di Ventra","firstName":"Massimiliano","lastName":"Di Ventra","id":"37403906400"},{"name":"Yuriy V.

A weighted median filter, whose filter coefficients are determined by a classifier based on an edge orientation map, is then used to produce an output from the four interpolants to preserve edges. Using the proposed methods, the original color can be faithfully reproduced with minimal amount of color artifacts even at edges.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2022291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5200729/05109690.pdf","startPage":"1946","endPage":"1957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2022291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Color Filter Array Demosaicking Using High-Order Interpolation Techniques With a Weighted Median Filter for Sharp Color Edge Preservation","volume":"18","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109690/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816688","pubMedId":"19556197","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109690/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Filter Array Demosaicking Using High-Order Interpolation Techniques With a Weighted Median Filter for Sharp Color Edge Preservation","sourcePdf":"18tip08-jli-2022291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075617S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5200729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5200729","articleId":"5109690","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5109694,"authors":[{"name":"Gilles Gasso","affiliation":["LITIS, EA 4108, INSA Universit\u00e9 de Rouen, Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5312990/5109694/5109694-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gilles Gasso received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1996 from University of Lome (TOGO).

Several algorithms have been proposed for solving the resulting nonconvex least-squares problem. This paper proposes a generic algorithm to address such a sparsity recovery problem for some class of nonconvex penalties. Our main contribution is that the proposed methodology is based on an iterative algorithm which solves at each iteration a convex weighted Lasso problem. It relies on the family of nonconvex penalties which can be decomposed as a difference of convex functions (DC). This allows us to apply DC programming which is a generic and principled way for solving nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem. We also show that several algorithms in the literature dealing with nonconvex penalties are particular instances of our algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generic framework compared to existing algorithms, including iterative reweighted least-squares methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2026004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05109694.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2026004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","startPage":"4686","endPage":"4698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovering Sparse Signals With a Certain Family of Nonconvex Penalties and DC Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recovering Sparse Signals With a Certain Family of Nonconvex Penalties and DC Programming","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109694/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977252","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5109694/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovering Sparse Signals With a Certain Family of Nonconvex Penalties and DC Programming","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-ggasso-2026004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081074S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5109694","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109695,"authors":[{"name":"Il-Woong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/5235875/5109695/5109695-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Il-Woong Kim received the B.S. degree from the School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon, Korea, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in computer science from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2007.","He is currently an Associate Research Engineer in SureSoft Technologies Inc., Seoul, Korea.

Due to the complexity of the OWL-S grammar, it is difficult to construct OWL-S descriptions manually. This paper presents an efficient model-driven approach to generate OWL-S ontologies from Unified Modeling Language (UML) models, which are widely used for software design and development. The proposed method is based on UML profiles to represent the characteristics of OWL-S. Specifically, a domain ontology is transformed into a class diagram, and UML diagrams are extended to represent the behavior of business processes. Finally, an XML metadata interchange (XMI) file extracted from UML diagrams is transformed into an OWL-S representation via an extensible stylesheet language transformation (XSLT) script. Experimental results with a large number of UML diagrams show that the proposed method handles effectively the control flow of complex processes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantic Web","Unified modeling language","Web services","Ontologies","Software design","Simple object access protocol","Software systems","Computer science","XML","Style sheet languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","grammars","knowledge representation languages","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","semantic Web","Unified Modeling Language","Web services","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven approach","semantic Web service","UML diagram","OWL-S representation","automated Web service discovery","automated Web service selection","automated Web service composition","OWL-S grammar complexity","Unified Modeling Language","software design","software development","domain ontology","class diagram","business process behavior representation","XML metadata interchange","XMI file","extensible stylesheet language transformation","XSLT script","complex process control flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MDA","OWL-S","Semantic Web Services","UML"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2023798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5235875/05109695.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2023798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model-Driven Approach for Describing Semantic Web Services: From UML to OWL-S","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Driven Approach for Describing Semantic Web Services: From UML to OWL-S","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109695/","volume":"39","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109695/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10919096","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Driven Approach for Describing Semantic Web Services: From UML to OWL-S","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-lee-2023798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123031S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5235875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5235875","articleId":"5109695","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5109699,"authors":[{"name":"Veria Havary-Nassab","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410627/5109699/5109699-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Veria Havary-Nassab was born in Sanandaj, Kurdistan, Iran.

Considering a two time slot two-way relaying scheme, each relay adjusts the phase and the amplitude of the mixture signal it receives from the two transceivers during the first time slot, by multiplying it with a complex beamforming coefficient. Then each relay transmits the so-obtained signal in the second time slot. Aiming at optimally calculating the beamforming coefficients as well as the transceiver transmit powers, we study two different approaches. In the first approach, we minimize the total transmit power (dissipated in the whole network) subject to two constraints on the transceivers' received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We prove that such a power minimization technique has a unique solution. We also show that the optimal weight vector can be obtained through a simple iterative algorithm which enjoys a linear computational complexity per iteration. We also prove that for symmetric relaying schemes (where the two constraints on the transceiver SNRs are the same), half of the minimum total transmit power will be allocated to the two transceivers and the remaining half will be shared among the relaying nodes. In the second approach, we will study an SNR balancing technique. In this technique, the smaller of the two transceiver SNRs is maximized while the total transmit power is kept below a certain power budget. We show that this problem has also a unique solution which can be obtained through an iterative procedure with a linear computational complexity per iteration. We also prove that this approach leads to a power allocation scheme, where half of the maximum power budget is allocated to the two transceivers and the remaining half will be shared among all the relay nodes. For both approaches, we devise distributed schemes which require a minimal cooperation among the two transceivers and the relays. In fact, we show that both techniques can be implemented such that the bandwidth, required to obtain the beamforming weights in a distributed manner, remains constant as the size of the network grows.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2026067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410627","startPage":"1238","endPage":"1250","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410627/05109699.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Distributed Beamforming for Two-Way Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5109699/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Distributed Beamforming for Two-Way Relay Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11136161","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Distributed Beamforming for Two-Way Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-sshahbazpanahi-2026067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075677S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"240","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5109699","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5109701,"authors":[{"name":"Chingfu Tsou","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control Engineering, Feng Chia University FCU, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5185350/5109701/5109701-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chingfu Tsou received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in power mechanical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Automatic Control Engineering, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan.

The fabrication process consists of only two photolithography masks that provide an effective way of manufacturing a resistive bulk microheater and a high-aspect-ratio microchannel. The electrothermal property of the proposed microheater has been characterized and verified by finite-element analysis and experiment. According to the design concept and experimental results, the largest temperature occurred at the smallest neck section due to the nonuniform property of the resistance along the length of the arch-type microheater, and thus, the vapor bubble was generated and attached to the vertical sidewall of the microheater. For a typical microheater design, bubble nucleation could be generated under a applied voltage of 5 V, and the bubble could obstruct the entire 100 mum width of the microchannel when the applied voltage reaches 8 V. A switching test has showed that the silicon-based microheater has a good thermal resistance behavior for long-term reliability and that the modulation of output flow rate is easily handled by the sizes of the thermal bubbles. Moreover, the bubble can be formed with a steady growth, even when the maximum fluid velocity is larger than 920 mum/s in a microchannel with a rectangular cross section 100 mum wide and 50 mum high. These results reveal that the microfluid gate presented here is well designed and that bubble sizes are stable and controllable.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2023882","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/5185350/05109701.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2023882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5185350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal Bubble Microfluidic Gate Based on SOI Wafer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109701/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal Bubble Microfluidic Gate Based on SOI Wafer","volume":"18","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10802424","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109701/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal Bubble Microfluidic Gate Based on SOI Wafer","sourcePdf":"jmems-tsou-2023882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073358S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5185350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5185350","articleId":"5109701","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109704,"authors":[{"name":"Momin Uppal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5286803/5109704/5109704-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Momin Uppal (S'06) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering (with highest distinction) from the GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Pakistan, in 2002 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2006, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include dirty-paper coding, broadcast channels, and cooperative communications."]},"firstName":"Momin","lastName":"Uppal","id":"37424290100"},{"name":"Zhixin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhixin Liu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees, both in electronic engineering, from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2007.","His research interests are in digital communication, information theory, distributed source coding, cooperative networks, and corresponding code designs."]},"firstName":"Zhixin","lastName":"Liu","id":"38084433000"},{"name":"Vladimir Stankovic","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5286803/5109704/5109704-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Vladimir Stankovi\u0107 (M'04) received the M.Eng. degree from the University of Belgrade, Serbia, in 2000 and the Dr.Ing.

Antenna stations consist of many simple, omnidirectional antennas. Flexible station-based signal processing allows for trading bandwidth against instantaneous sky coverage. Central processing implements a software correlator, which can be reconfigured as a full tied array beamformer, and online calibration functions to handle the large data streams produced by the system. The key science programs for LOFAR challenge the technical specifications in several directions, which resulted in a highly reconfigurable architecture. This paper describes the LOFAR system design, the configuration, and the signal-processing chain. LOFAR has been developed by ASTRON and a consortium of universities and industrial partners. The instrument is currently being deployed in The Netherlands. Additional stations are being built in several other European countries. The telescope is considered an important pathfinder for the square kilometer array (SKA) in demonstrating the potential of (sparse) aperture arrays, in developing solutions to major calibration issues that are directly applicable to the SKA, and in paving the way for the mass-production and operations of such large distributed radio telescope systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for

analysis of biological image data generally involves the detection of many subresolution spots. Especially in live cell imaging, for which fluorescence microscopy is often used, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be extremely low, making automated spot detection a very challenging task. In the past, many methods have been proposed to perform this task, but a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of these methods is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the most frequently used detection methods for this purpose. These include seven unsupervised and two supervised methods. We perform experiments on synthetic images of three different types, for which the ground truth was available, as well as on real image data sets acquired for two different biological studies, for which we obtained expert manual annotations to compare with. The results from both types of experiments suggest that for very low SNRs ( \u00bf 2), the supervised (machine learning) methods perform best overall. Of the unsupervised methods, the detectors based on the so-called \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h</i>\n -dome transform from mathematical morphology or the multiscale variance-stabilizing transform perform comparably, and have the advantage that they do not require a cumbersome learning stage. At high SNRs ( > 5), the difference in performance of all considered detectors becomes negligible.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2009.2025127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5405633/05109713.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5405633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2009.2025127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative Comparison of Spot Detection Methods in Fluorescence Microscopy","volume":"29","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109713/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11118439","pubMedId":"19556194","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109713/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative Comparison of Spot Detection Methods in Fluorescence Microscopy","sourcePdf":"tmi-ismal-2025127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140782S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5405633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"5405633","articleId":"5109713","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5109718,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Perley","affiliation":["National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Perley","id":"37573219800"},{"name":"Peter Napier","affiliation":["National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Napier","id":"37376557800"},{"name":"Jim Jackson","affiliation":["National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Jackson","id":"37088628904"},{"name":"Bryan Butler","affiliation":["National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Bryan","lastName":"Butler","id":"37574866700"},{"name":"Brent Carlson","affiliation":["Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory, National Research Council Canada, Penticton, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Carlson","id":"37265522500"},{"name":"David Fort","affiliation":["Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory, National Research Council Canada, Penticton, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Fort","id":"37581563300"},{"name":"Peter Dewdney","affiliation":["SKA Program Development, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Dewdney","id":"37265525700"},{"name":"Barry Clark","affiliation":["National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Barry","lastName":"Clark","id":"37381656400"},{"name":"Robert Hayward","affiliation":["National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Hayward","id":"37088628666"},{"name":"Steven Durand","affiliation":["National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Durand","id":"37585589300"},{"name":"Mike Revnell","affiliation":["National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Revnell","id":"37088628648"},{"name":"Mark McKinnon","affiliation":["National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"McKinnon","id":"37085531161"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"5109718","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":764},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"In almost 30 years of operation, the Very Large Array (VLA) has proved to be a remarkably flexible and productive radio telescope.

The system has a general structure utilizing a phased array antenna composed of dual-channel TRMs. TRM gain and phase calibration is carried out using orthogonal phase coding (OPC). The signal of the individual TRM is phase-encoded according to a set of orthogonal codes to be separated from the composite calibration signal. OPC uses 1 bit of a digital phase-shifter for encoding, without the need for additional encoding hardware. Performance of the method is examined. Calibration results are developed both theoretically and through simulation in case of TRM amplifier or phase-shifter failure. Zero-padding is used to eliminate calibration error of the first TRM. A crosstalk model is proposed to investigate the effect of imperfect isolation between the two polarization channels of each TRM, and a way to reduce this error is also given. At last, system path gain variation is measured utilizing the internal calibration loop. The OPC method has an accuracy of 0.2 dB for gain and better than 2deg for phase, with 10-dB signal-to-noise ratio and perfect isolation between the two polarization channels. The error due to imperfect isolation is usually small and can be ignored. The simple way to detect TRM malfunction is verified through simulation, and it is also in accordance with TerraSAR-X in-orbit calibration outcomes. The proposed OPC method is shown to be an effective way of internally calibrating TRMs of a phased array antenna.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5332062/05109734.pdf","startPage":"3969","endPage":"3980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2018629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2018629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarimetric SAR Internal Calibration Scheme Based on T/R Module Orthogonal Phase Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Transmission line measurements","Phased arrays","Antenna arrays","Polarization","Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar","Synthetic aperture radar","Hardware","Crosstalk","Gain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","geophysical techniques","radar antennas","radar polarimetry","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarimetric SAR internal calibration scheme","T/R module orthogonal phase coding","synthetic aperture radar","individual transmit/receive module calibration","system gain calibration","phased array antenna","digital phase-shifter","TerraSAR-X in-orbit calibration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Calibration","failure","isolation","phase encoding","polarimetric","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","transmit/receive module (TRM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Polarimetric SAR Internal Calibration Scheme Based on T/R Module Orthogonal Phase Coding","volume":"47","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5109734/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979214","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarimetric SAR Internal Calibration Scheme Based on T/R Module Orthogonal Phase Coding","sourcePdf":"tgrs-wang-2018629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114201S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5332062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5332062","articleId":"5109734","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5109735,"authors":[{"name":"Deyun Wei","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology Research Institute of Optic-Electronics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Deyun","lastName":"Wei","id":"37394558300"},{"name":"Qiwen Ran","affiliation":["Science Research Center, Research of Academy of Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qiwen","lastName":"Ran","id":"37283250700"},{"name":"Yuanmin Li","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yuanmin","lastName":"Li","id":"37405710300"},{"name":"Jing Ma","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology Research Institute of Optic-Electronics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ma","id":"37407129600"},{"name":"Liying Tan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology Research Institute of Optic-Electronics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Liying","lastName":"Tan","id":"37404436700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5109735","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":783},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Fourier transforms","Optical signal processing","Optical filters","Radio access networks","Pattern analysis","Laboratories","Tunable circuits and devices","Laser theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","filtering theory","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution theorem","product theorem","linear canonical transform","filters","fractional Fourier transform domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolution and product theorems","linear canonical transform"]}],"abstract":"The linear canonical transform (LCT) plays an important role in many fields of optics and signal processing.

Wall reflections are often stronger than target reflections, and they tend to persist over a long duration of time. Therefore, weak and close by targets behind walls become obscured and invisible in the image. In this paper, we apply spatial filters across the antenna array to remove, or at least significantly mitigate, the spatial zero-frequency and low-frequency components which correspond to wall reflections. Unmasking the behind-the-wall targets via the application of spatial filters recognizes the fact that the wall electromagnetic (EM) responses do not significantly differ when viewed by the different antennas along the axis of a real or synthesized array aperture which is parallel to the wall. The proposed approach is tested with experimental data using solid wall, multilayered wall, and cinder block wall. It is shown that the wall reflections can be effectively reduced by spatial preprocessing prior to beamforming, producing similar imaging results to those achieved when a background scene without the target is available.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Filtering for Wall-Clutter Mitigation in Through-the-Wall Radar Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2019728","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5210215/05109740.pdf","startPage":"3192","endPage":"3208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2019728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Filtering for Wall-Clutter Mitigation in Through-the-Wall Radar Imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5109740/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840347","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Filtering for Wall-Clutter Mitigation in Through-the-Wall Radar Imaging","sourcePdf":"tgrs-yoon-2019728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059928S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5210215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"5210215","articleId":"5109740","onlineDate":"23 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5109743,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Semnani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, K.N.

RTFs are often modeled as finite-impulse response filters, characterized by orders of thousands of taps and non-minimum phase. In practice, only approximate estimates of the actual RTFs are available due to measurement noise, limited estimation accuracy, and temporal variation of source-receiver position. These issues make equalization a difficult problem. In this paper, we discuss multichannel equalization with focus on inexact RTF estimates. We present a multichannel method for the equalization filter design utilizing decimated and oversampled subbands, where the full-band acoustic impulse response is decomposed into equivalent subband filters prior to equalization. This technique is not only more computationally efficient but also more robust to impulse response inaccuracies compared with the full-band counterpart.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5109759/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10731426","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Equalization of Multichannel Acoustic Systems in Oversampled Subbands","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalization of Multichannel Acoustic Systems in Oversampled Subbands","sourcePdf":"tasl-naylor-2015692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104157S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5109758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5109758","articleId":"5109759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5109760,"authors":[{"name":"Shmulik Markovich","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Shmulik","lastName":"Markovich","id":"37572970400"},{"name":"Sharon Gannot","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Sharon","lastName":"Gannot","id":"37267880400"},{"name":"Israel Cohen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37274584400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-7916"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-7924"}],"articleNumber":"5109760","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":167,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":1531},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109760","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Working environment noise","Speech","Interference constraints","Acoustic noise","Transfer functions","Acoustic distortion","Signal design","Acoustic measurements","Distortion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","interference suppression","reverberation","spectral analysis","speech processing","transfer function matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel eigenspace beamforming","reverberant noisy environment","multiple speech signal interference","acoustic room impulse response","distortion","linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer","multimicrophone measurement","generalized sidelobe canceler","blocking matrix","adaptive noise canceler","white noise","relative transfer function","generalized eigenvalue decomposition","power spectral density matrix","orthogonal triangular decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","interference cancellation","speech enhancement","subspace methods"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2016395","endPage":"1086","startPage":"1071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5109758/05109760.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2016395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel Eigenspace Beamforming in a Reverberant Noisy Environment With Multiple Interfering Speech Signals","abstract":"In many practical environments we wish to extract several desired speech signals, which are contaminated by nonstationary and stationary interfering signals. The desired signals may also be subject to distortion imposed by the acoustic room impulse responses (RIRs). In this paper, a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer is designed for extracting the desired signals from multimicrophone measurements. The beamformer satisfies two sets of linear constraints. One set is dedicated to maintaining the desired signals, while the other set is chosen to mitigate both the stationary and nonstationary interferences. Unlike classical beamformers, which approximate the RIRs as delay-only filters, we take into account the entire RIR [or its respective acoustic transfer function (ATF)]. The LCMV beamformer is then reformulated in a generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) structure, consisting of a fixed beamformer (FBF), blocking matrix (BM), and adaptive noise canceler (ANC). It is shown that for spatially white noise field, the beamformer reduces to a FBF, satisfying the constraint sets, without power minimization. It is shown that the application of the adaptive ANC contributes to interference reduction, but only when the constraint sets are not completely satisfied. We show that relative transfer functions (RTFs), which relate the desired speech sources and the microphones, and a basis for the interference subspace suffice for constructing the beamformer. The RTFs are estimated by applying the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) procedure to the power spectral density (PSD) matrices of the received signals and the stationary noise. A basis for the interference subspace is estimated by collecting eigenvectors, calculated in segments where nonstationary interfering sources are active and the desired sources are inactive. The rank of the basis is then reduced by the application of the orthogonal triangular decomposition (QRD). This procedure relaxes the common requirement for nonoverlapping activity periods of the interference sources. A comprehensive experimental study in both simulated and real environments demonstrates the performance of the proposed beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109760/","volume":"17","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10731427","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel Eigenspace Beamforming in a Reverberant Noisy Environment With Multiple Interfering Speech Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel Eigenspace Beamforming in a Reverberant Noisy Environment With Multiple Interfering Speech Signals","sourcePdf":"tasl-gannot-2016395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06106S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","isNumber":"5109758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"167","articleId":"5109760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5109761,"authors":[{"name":"Jer\u00d3nimo Arenas-Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Leganes, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5109758/5109761/5109761-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jer\u00f3nimo Arenas-Garc\u00eda (S'00\u2013M'04) received the Telecommunication Engineer degree (honors) from Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication technologies (honors) from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Legan\u00e9s, Spain, in 2004.","After a postdoctoral stay at the Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, he returned to Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, where he is currently a Lecturer of digital signal and information processing with the Department of Signal Theory and Communications.

Proportionate schemes offer improved performance when the echo path is sparse, but are still subject to some compromises regarding their convergence properties and steady-state error. In this paper, we study how combination schemes, where the outputs of two independent adaptive filters are adaptively mixed together, can be used to increase IPNLMS robustness to channels with different degrees of sparsity, as well as to alleviate the rate of convergence versus steady-state misadjustment tradeoff imposed by the selection of the step size. We also introduce a new block-based combination scheme which is specifically designed to further exploit the characteristics of the IPNLMS filter. The advantages of these combined filters are justified theoretically and illustrated in several echo cancellation scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2019925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5109758/05109761.pdf","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2019925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Combination of Proportionate Filters for Sparse Echo Cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109761/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Combination of Proportionate Filters for Sparse Echo Cancellation","volume":"17","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10721299","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109761/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Combination of Proportionate Filters for Sparse Echo Cancellation","sourcePdf":"17tasl05-jgarcia-2019925.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098104S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5109758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5109758","articleId":"5109761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109762,"authors":[{"name":"Tiemin Mei","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China","School of Information Science and Engineering, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5109758/5109762/5109762-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tiemin Mei received the B.S. degree in physics from Zhongshan University, Guanzhou, China, in 1986, the M.S. degree in biophysics from China Medical University, Shenyang, in 1991, and the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2006.","He has been with the Institute for Signal Processing, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany, since 2007.

It is shown that cumulants at different time instants and time-delayed cumulants can be used as criteria for blind source separation (BSS). Furthermore, it is proved that the cumulant-based separation criteria are directly related to the separability conditions. Batch-data and online learning rules are developed based on the joint diagonalization of symmetric fourth-order cumulant matrices, and the learning rules are further simplified to correlation-based BSS algorithms. In addition, an initialization strategy is proposed for improving the convergence of the learning rules.

A variety of features have been proposed for audio recognition, including the popular Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) which describe the audio spectral shape. Environmental sounds, such as chirpings of insects and sounds of rain which are typically noise-like with a broad flat spectrum, may include strong temporal domain signatures. However, only few temporal-domain features have been developed to characterize such diverse audio signals previously. Here, we perform an empirical feature analysis for audio environment characterization and propose to use the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm to obtain effective time-frequency features. The MP-based method utilizes a dictionary of atoms for feature selection, resulting in a flexible, intuitive and physically interpretable set of features. The MP-based feature is adopted to supplement the MFCC features to yield higher recognition accuracy for environmental sounds. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of these joint features for unstructured environmental sound classification, including listening tests to study human recognition capabilities. Our recognition system has shown to produce comparable performance as human listeners.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109766/","volume":"17","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5109766/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10731424","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Environmental Sound Recognition With Time\u2013Frequency Audio Features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Environmental Sound Recognition With Time\u2013Frequency Audio Features","sourcePdf":"17tasl05-schu-2017438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183747S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5109758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"351","xplore-issue":"5109758","articleId":"5109766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5109768,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen-Hua Ling","affiliation":["iFlytek Speech Laboratory, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5109758/5109768/5109768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhen-Hua Ling received the B.E. degree in electronic information engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in signal and information processing from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2002, 2005, and 2008 respectively.","From October 2007 to March 2008, he was a Marie Curie Fellow at the Center for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K. He is currently a joint Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Science and Technology of China and iFlytek Co., Ltd., China.

In broad terms, this may be achieved by estimating the joint distribution of acoustic and articulatory features during training. This may in turn be used in conjunction with a maximum-likelihood criterion to produce acoustic synthesis parameters for generating speech. Within this broad approach, we explore several variations that are possible in the construction of an HMM-based synthesis system which allow articulatory features to influence acoustic modeling: model clustering, state synchrony and cross-stream feature dependency. Performance is evaluated using the RMS error of generated acoustic parameters as well as formal listening tests. Our results show that the accuracy of acoustic parameter prediction and the naturalness of synthesized speech can be improved when shared clustering and asynchronous-state model structures are adopted for combined acoustic and articulatory features. Most significantly, however, our experiments demonstrate that modeling the dependency between these two feature streams can make speech synthesis systems more flexible. The characteristics of synthetic speech can be easily controlled by modifying generated articulatory features as part of the process of producing acoustic synthesis parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2014796","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5109758/05109768.pdf","startPage":"1171","endPage":"1185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2014796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Articulatory Features Into HMM-Based Parametric Speech Synthesis","volume":"17","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109768/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10731425","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109768/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Articulatory Features Into HMM-Based Parametric Speech Synthesis","sourcePdf":"17tasl04-zling-2014796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085746S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5109758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5109758","articleId":"5109768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5109775,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiano Niclass","affiliation":["Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Aichi, Japan","Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5109769/5109775/5109775-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cristiano Niclass (S'05\u2013M'08) received the M.S. degree in microelectronics in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science in 2008, both from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL).","From 2003 to 2006, he worked as a part-time R&D Engineer for Ingenico (Suisse) SA in the design of electronic payment devices.

The camera also enables image enhancement of 2D scenes when used in passive mode, where differential maps of the reflection patterns are the basis for advanced image processing algorithms. Extensive testing has shown the suitability of the technique and confirmed phase accuracy predictions. Experimental results showed that the proposed rangefinder method is effective.

It performs direct amplitude modulation of an input RF carrier by digitally controlling an array of 127 unary-weighted and three binary-weighted elementary gain cells. The DPA is based on a novel two-stage topology, which allows seamless operation from 800 MHz through 2 GHz, with a full-power efficiency larger than 40% and a 25.2 dBm maximum envelope power. Adaptive digital predistortion is exploited for DPA linearization. The circuit is thus able to reconstruct 21.7 dBm WCDMA/EDGE signals at 1.9 GHz with 38% efficiency and a higher than 10 dB margin on all spectral specifications. As a result of the digital modulation technique, a higher than 20.1 % efficiency is guaranteed for WCDMA signals with a peak-to-average power ratio as high as 10.8 dB. Furthermore, a 15.3 dBm, 5 MHz WiMAX OFDM signal is successfully reconstructed with a 22% efficiency and 1.53% rms EVM. A high 10-bit nominal resolution enables a wide-range TX power control strategy to be implemented, which greatly minimizes the quiescent consumption down to 10 mW. A 16.4% CDMA average efficiency is thus obtained across a > 70 dB power control range, while complying with all the spectral specifications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109779/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","volume":"44","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10733522","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5109779/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 25 dBm Digitally Modulated CMOS Power Amplifier for WCDMA/EDGE/OFDM With Adaptive Digital Predistortion and Efficient Power Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 25 dBm Digitally Modulated CMOS Power Amplifier for WCDMA/EDGE/OFDM With Adaptive Digital Predistortion and Efficient Power Control","sourcePdf":"44jssc07-cpresti-2020226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142293S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5109769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"5109769","articleId":"5109779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5109781,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Ojefors","affiliation":["Institute of High-Frequency and Communication Technology, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5109769/5109781/5109781-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erik \u00d6jefors (S'01\u2013M'06) received the M.Sc. degree in engineering physics and the Ph.D. degree in microwave technology from Uppsala University, Sweden, in 2000 and 2006, respectively.","In 2007, he joined the Institute of High-Frequency and Quantum Electronics at the University of Siegen, Germany.

The 2times-oversampling phase-tracking CDR, implemented in 90 nm bulk CMOS technology, covers the whole range of data rates from 5.75 to 44 Gb/s realized in a single IC by the novel feature of a data rate selection logic. Input data are sampled with eight parallel differential master-slave flip-flops, where bandwidth enhancement techniques were necessary for 90 nm CMOS. Precise and low-jitter local clock phases are generated by an analog delay-locked loop. These clock phases are aligned to the incoming data by four parallel phase rotators. The phase-tracking loop of the CDR is realized as a digital delay-locked loop and is therefore immune against process tolerances. The CDR is able to track a maximum frequency deviation of plusmn615 ppm between incoming data and a local reference clock and fulfills the extended XAUI jitter tolerance mask.

The resulting voltage is equal to the extrapolated threshold voltage of a MOSFET at absolute zero temperature, which was about 745 mV for the MOSFETs we used. The temperature coefficient of the voltage was 7 ppm/degC at best and 15 ppm/degC on average, in a range from - 20 to 80degC. The line sensitivity was 20 ppm/V in a supply voltage range of 1.4-3 V, and the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) was -45 dB at 100 Hz. The power dissipation was 0.3 muW at 80degC. The chip area was 0.05 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n .

Therefore, a pseudo-differential amplifier is employed in this design because of its high linearity. Furthermore, the proposed inductive division reduces the phase noise by increasing the signal amplitude across the varactor, without affecting the operation mode of the cross-coupled pair transistors. It also helps to increase the tuning range by isolating the varactor from the parasitic capacitances of the transistors and interconnects. The mm-wave oscillator is fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS technology. Under 0.7 V supply, the oscillator achieves a tuning range from 53.2 GHz to 58.4 GHz, consuming 8.1 mW.

The receiver is targeted towards applications like wireless sensor networks typically requiring ultra energy-efficient, low data-rate communication over a relative short range. The proposed receiver implements pulse correlation in the analog domain to severely relax the power consumption of the ADCs and digital backend. Furthermore a fully integrated prototype of the analog front-end, containing a PLL, programmable clocking generator, analog pulse correlator, a linear-in-dB variable gain amplifier and a 4-bit ADC, is demonstrated. Several design decisions and techniques, like correlation with a windowed LO instead of with a matched template, exploiting the duty-cycled nature of the system, operation in the sub-1 GHz band as well as careful circuit design are employed to reach ultra-low power consumption. The analog front-end was manufactured in 130 nm CMOS and the active circuit area measures 1000 mum times 1500 mum. A maximum channel conversion gain of 50 dB can be achieved. Two symbol rates, 39.0625 M pulses per second (Mpps) and 19.531 Mpps are supported. The AFE consumes 2.3 mA from a 1.2 V power supply when operating at 39.0625 Mpps. This corresponds to an energy consumption of 70 pJ/pulse. A wireless link over more than 10 m in an office-like environment has been demonstrated at 19.531 Mpps with a PER < 1E -3 under direct LOS conditions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2020220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109769","startPage":"1862","endPage":"1871","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5109769/05109791.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 70 pJ/Pulse Analog Front-End in 130 nm CMOS for UWB Impulse Radio Receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5109791/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A 70 pJ/Pulse Analog Front-End in 130 nm CMOS for UWB Impulse Radio Receivers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10733514","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 70 pJ/Pulse Analog Front-End in 130 nm CMOS for UWB Impulse Radio Receivers","sourcePdf":"44jssc07-nvanhelleputte-2020220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085027S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5109769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5109769","articleId":"5109791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5109792,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Cosemans","affiliation":["ESAT-MICAS Laboratory, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5109769/5109792/5109792-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Cosemans (S'04) was born in Mol, Belgium, in 1981.

Several techniques were combined to obtain these performance numbers. Short buffered local bit lines reduce the impact of the cell read current on memory delay. Extended global bitlines are used which improves delay and energy consumption and which reduces the number of sense amplifiers in the memory to 32.

clamped-clamped beam resonators with resonance frequency around 22 MHz. The MEMS resonators are fabricated with a 0.35-mum CMOS process and monolithically integrated with an on-chip differential amplifier. The CMOS-MEMS resonator shows high-quality factors of 227 in air conditions and 4400 in a vacuum for a bias voltage of 5 V. In air conditions, the CMOS-MEMS parallel filter presents a programmable bandwidth from 100 to 200 kHz with a <1-dB ripple. In a vacuum, the filter presents a stop-band attenuation of 37 dB and a shape factor as low as 2.5 for a CMOS-compatible bias voltage of 5 V, demonstrating competitive performance compared with the state of the art of not fully integrated MEMS filters.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band pass filters","Resonator filters","Micromechanical devices","Voltage","Fabrication","Resonance","Resonant frequency","CMOS process","Differential amplifiers","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","band-stop filters","circuit tuning","CMOS integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","HF amplifiers","microfabrication","micromechanical resonators","Q-factor","radiofrequency filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS-MEMS RF-tunable bandpass filter","high-Q polysilicon clamped-clamped beam resonators","MEMS resonator fabrication","monolithically-integrated on-chip differential amplifier","high-quality factor","stop-band attenuation","frequency 22 MHz","voltage 5 V","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandpass filter","CMOS\u2013MEMS","micromechanical filter","system-on-chip"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LED.2009.2022509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/5109799/05109806.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2009.2022509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS\u2013MEMS RF-Tunable Bandpass Filter Based on Two High- - 22-MHz Polysilicon Clamped-Clamped Beam Resonators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS\u2013MEMS RF-Tunable Bandpass Filter Based on Two High- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$Q$</tex></formula> 22-MHz Polysilicon Clamped-Clamped Beam Resonators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109806/","volume":"30","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109806/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10731595","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS\u2013MEMS RF-Tunable Bandpass Filter Based on Two High- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$Q$</tex></formula> 22-MHz Polysilicon Clamped-Clamped Beam Resonators","sourcePdf":"led-lopez-2022509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130562S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"5109799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5109799","articleId":"5109806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5109839,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To provide the plug-and-play feature and the power quality requirements of the CERTS microgrid, all microsources regardless of their prime mover type must have a unified dynamic performance. This necessitates attaching an energy storage module to some or all of the microsources. The storage module is attached to the prime mover through a power electronic interface that couples the microsource to the microgrid. Details of the energy storage module, the power electronic interface and the corresponding controls are described. Performance of an example microsource, which includes a synchronous generator, a storage module and an electronic interface, is studied. Dynamic performance of the example microsource when operating in the CERTS microgrid is evaluated based on digital time-domain simulations in the EMTP-RV software environment. Effectiveness of the storage module, the electronic interface and the corresponding controls in enhancing the microsource performance is verified.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2021040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2021040","startPage":"1598","endPage":"1608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5109837/05109862.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Generation Interface to the CERTS Microgrid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Generation Interface to the CERTS Microgrid","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731634","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5109862/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Generation Interface to the CERTS Microgrid","sourcePdf":"24tpwrd03-hnikkhajoei-2021040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099403S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5109837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"288","xplore-issue":"5109837","articleId":"5109862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":5109864,"authors":[{"name":"Justinian Anatory","affiliation":["School of Virtual Education, College of Informatics and Virtual Education, University of Dodoma, Dodoma, Tanzania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5109837/5109864/5109864-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Justinian Anatory (S'06\u2013M'08) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering from the University of Dar es Salaam, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in 1998, 2003, and 2007, respectively.","He was a Software and IT Engineer with Beta Communication Consulting Co.

However, various multipaths within a broadband power-line communication (BPLC) system exist due to stochastic changes in the network load impedances, branches, etc. This further affects network performance. This paper attempts to investigate the performance of indoor channels of a BPLC system that uses orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. It is observed that when a branch is added in the link between the sending and receiving end of an indoor channel, an average of 4-dB power loss is found. Additionally, when the terminal impedances of the branch change from the line characteristic impedance to impedance of lower values, the power loss (signal-to-noise ratio) is about 0.67 dB/Omega. On the contrary, for every increase in the terminal impedances by 100 Omega, above the line characteristic impedance, the power loss is 0.1 dB/Omega. When the line terminal impedances are close to short or open circuits, OFDM techniques show degraded performance. This situation is also observed when the number of branches increases. In this paper, it is shown that to overcome such performance degradation, the concatenated Reed-Solomon codes/interleaved Viterbi methods can be used. The observations presented in the paper could be useful for an efficient design of a BPLC system that uses OFDM techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2014281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5109837/05109864.pdf","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2014281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Multipath on OFDM Systems for Indoor Broadband Power-Line Communication Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5109864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109864/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Multipath on OFDM Systems for Indoor Broadband Power-Line Communication Networks","volume":"24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10731635","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5109864/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Multipath on OFDM Systems for Indoor Broadband Power-Line Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-janatory-2014281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096566S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5109837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5109837","articleId":"5109864","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5109867,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Perez","affiliation":["La Salle Engineering, Ramon Llull University, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5109837/5109867/5109867-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio P\u00e9rez was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1976.

Two dc offsets in a secondary relaying signal are treated as one dc offset which is piecewise approximated in one cycle data window. The effect of the dc offsets can be eliminated by the approximated dc offset. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by using computer-simulated signals and Electromagnetic Transients Program-generated signals. The algorithm is also tested on a hardware board with TMS320C32 microprocessor.

Wind farms are one of the DGs, and they have intermittent characteristics. This paper presents a method using wind generator voltages, static compensators, and transformer taps as controllers to regulate the voltage profile for operation planning in a distribution system. Wind power generations and bus loads are modeled with random variables. Through gray-based genetic algorithms (GAs), the MW loss in the system is minimized and the operational constraints are fulfilled. Moreover, this paper uses the cumulant method to calculate the bus voltage fluctuation by using the algebraic addition and multiplication to avoid convolution. The probability density function of the voltage fluctuation can be further expressed by the Gram-Charlier series expansion. Applicability of the proposed method is verified through simulation by using a 17-bus system and an autonomous 24-bus (Penghu) system.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2016625","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1449","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5109837/05109885.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2016625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal VAR Control Considering Wind Farms Using Probabilistic Load-Flow and Gray-Based Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Optimal control","Wind farms","Genetic algorithms","Voltage fluctuations","Distributed control","Green products","Wind energy generation","STATCOM","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","distributed power generation","genetic algorithms","load flow control","reactive power control","series (mathematics)","static VAr compensators","voltage control","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal VAR control","wind farm","probabilistic load flow","gray-based genetic algorithm","distributed generation","environmental sustainability","wind generator voltage","static compensator","transformer taps","bus voltage fluctuation","algebraic addition","algebraic multiplication","Gram-Charlier series expansion","17-bus system","autonomous 24-bus system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cumulant","genetic algorithm (GA)","gray code","reactive power control","wind farm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5109885/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal VAR Control Considering Wind Farms Using Probabilistic Load-Flow and Gray-Based Genetic Algorithms","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5109885/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731642","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal VAR Control Considering Wind Farms Using Probabilistic Load-Flow and Gray-Based Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-hong-2016625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119668S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5109837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5109837","articleId":"5109885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
