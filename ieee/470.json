Six different facial expressions were considered. Firstly, logarithmic Gabor filters were applied to extract the features. Optimal subsets of features were then selected for each expression, down-sampled and further reduced in size via principal component analysis (PCA). The arrays of eigenvectors were multiplied by the original log-Gabor features to form feature arrays concatenated into six data tensors, representing training sets for different emotions. Each tensor was then used to train one of the six parallel neural networks making each network most sensitive to a different emotion. The classification efficiency of the proposed method was tested on static images from the Cohn-Kanade database. The results were compared with the full set of log-Gabor features. The average percentage of the correct classifications varied across different expressions from 31% to 85% for the optimised sub-set of log-Gabor features and from 23% to 67% for the full set of features. The average correct classification rate was increased from 52% for the full set of the log-Gabor features, to 70% for the optimised sub-set of log-Gabor features.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2008.13","startPage":"77","endPage":"83","publicationTitle":"2008 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2008.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4699978","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4699977/4699978/04700003.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial Expression Recognition Using Neural Networks and Log-Gabor Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700003/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Facial Expression Recognition Using Neural Networks and Log-Gabor Filters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700003/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10414385","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial Expression Recognition Using Neural Networks and Log-Gabor Filters","confLoc":"Canberra, ACT, Australia","sourcePdf":"3456a077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05787S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4699977","isNumber":"4699978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4699977","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4699978","articleId":"4700003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4700005,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Mazloom","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Shahid Chamran University, Ahwaz, Iran"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Mazloom","id":"37658302100"},{"name":"Saeed Ayat","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Payame Noor University, Najafabad, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Ayat","id":"37427429600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3456-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4700005","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Authentication","Humans","Computer networks","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Computational complexity","Wavelet transforms","Data security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","neural nets","principal component analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational method","PCA","ANN","face recognition accuracy","neural networks","feature extraction","classification rules","wavelet transform","facial variations","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face Recognition","Wavelet","PCA","ANN"]}],"abstract":"This work presents a method to increase the face recognition accuracy using a combination of Wavelet, PCA, and Neural Networks.

Previous research work in data mining has shown that removing redundant features improves rather than deteriorates the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose an approach to the problem of soil moisture prediction, which integrates two components: feature selection and prediction model: a method is proposed for feature selection that effectively removes the redundant decision factors; This is followed by a feedforward neural network to make prediction based on the retained (i.e. non-redundant) decision factors. Empirical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, with the help of the proposed feature selection component to remove redundant decision factors, the proposed approach is shown to give better prediction accuracy with lower data collection cost.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2008.35","pdfPath":"/iel5/4699977/4699978/04700011.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","publicationTitle":"2008 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2008.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4699978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soil Moisture Prediction with Feature Selection Using a Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Soil Moisture Prediction with Feature Selection Using a Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10414393","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4700011/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soil Moisture Prediction with Feature Selection Using a Neural Network","confLoc":"Canberra, ACT, Australia","sourcePdf":"3456a130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05659S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4699977","isNumber":"4699978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4699977","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4699978","articleId":"4700011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4700015,"authors":[{"name":"Honghoon Jang","affiliation":["Department of Digital Media, College of Information Science, Soongsil University"],"firstName":"Honghoon","lastName":"Jang","id":"37655997700"},{"name":"Anjin Park","affiliation":["Department of Digital Media, College of Information Science, Soongsil University"],"firstName":"Anjin","lastName":"Park","id":"37649042500"},{"name":"Keechul Jung","affiliation":["Department of Digital Media, College of Information Science, Soongsil University"],"firstName":"Keechul","lastName":"Jung","id":"37065426000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3456-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4700015","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2364},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700015","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Central Processing Unit","Computer graphics","Image processing","Computer architecture","Computer vision","Hardware","Computer networks","Pattern recognition","Programming profession"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","image processing","pattern recognition","graphic processing unit","graphics shading languages","computer graphics","compute unified device architecture","open multiprocessing","text detection system"]}],"abstract":"Many algorithms for image processing and pattern recognition have recently been implemented on GPU (graphic processing unit) for faster computational times. However, the implementation using GPU encounters two problems. First, the programmer should master the fundamentals of the graphics shading languages that require the prior knowledge on computer graphics. Second, in a job which needs much cooperation between CPU and GPU, which is usual in image processings and pattern recognitions contrary to the graphics area, CPU should generate raw feature data for GPU processing as much as possible to effectively utilize GPU performance. This paper proposes more quick and efficient implementation of neural networks on both GPU and multi-core CPU. We use CUDA (compute unified device architecture) that can be easily programmed due to its simple C language-like style instead of GPU to solve the first problem. Moreover, OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is used to concurrently process multiple data with single instruction on multi-core CPU, which results ineffectively utilizing the memories of GPU. In the experiments, we implemented neural networks-based text detection system using the proposed architecture, and the computational times showed about 15 times faster than implementation using CPU and about 4 times faster than implementation on only GPU without OpenMP.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2008.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4699978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2008.82","endPage":"161","publicationTitle":"2008 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4699977/4699978/04700015.pdf","startPage":"155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Implementation Using CUDA and OpenMP","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700015/","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Implementation Using CUDA and OpenMP","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10414397","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4700015/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Implementation Using CUDA and OpenMP","confLoc":"Canberra, ACT, Australia","sourcePdf":"3456a155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066233S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4699977","isNumber":"4699978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4699977","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4699978","articleId":"4700015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4700026,"authors":[{"name":"Julius Fabian Ohmer","affiliation":["Intell.

Various research groups proposed methods to extend its performance, both in terms of execution time and stability. Recent research has shown that current graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven to be very efficient SIMD parallel processing architectures that can be used to speed up the execution time of the KLT algorithm by an order of a magnitude compared with an ordinary CPU implementation and thus making it suitable for real-time applications on commodity hardware. Previous publications demonstrated the use of the GPU for the tracking and image processing part of the KLT algorithm. One essential, but computationally demanding step of the KLT algorithm is the feature selection step. It injects fresh feature points into the existing point set and thus enables the KLT to continuously track points throughout an image sequence. Those sequences can contain rapid movements or they may be of low quality. In such situations, features diminish rapidly and the step must be performed potentially for every frame. Thus, the performance of the otherwise efficient GPU implementation declines substantially, as this step includes a sorting operation on the sparse feature map, which is difficult to implement efficiently on the GPU. We use the KLT algorithm to calculate a stable frame registration with high accuracy using the feature point set. We found that maintaining a well distributed feature set through frequent injections of points is an essential requirement. In this paper we will demonstrate an alternative feature reselection method that can be efficiently implemented on the GPU. It is a Monte-Carlo-based approximation of the original method and leads to very good tracking results with just a fraction of the computational cost.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4699978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2008.50","publicationTitle":"2008 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4699977/4699978/04700026.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"241","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2008.50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-Accelerated KLT Tracking with Monte-Carlo-Based Feature Reselection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"GPU-Accelerated KLT Tracking with Monte-Carlo-Based Feature Reselection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4700026/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10414408","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700026/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-Accelerated KLT Tracking with Monte-Carlo-Based Feature Reselection","confLoc":"Canberra, ACT, Australia","sourcePdf":"3456a234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043987S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4699977","isNumber":"4699978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4699977","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4699978","articleId":"4700026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4700030,"authors":[{"name":"Hugh L.

These methods are used in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. The OFDM employs orthogonal sub-carriers for data modulation. These sub-carriers unexpectedly present a large peak to average power ratio (PAPR) in some cases. In order to reduce PAPR, the sequence of input data is partitioned into disjoint sub-block of PTS. If number of sub-block increases, high efficiency of PAPR reduction can be obtained. However, a quite large calculation cost must be demanded and thus it is impossible to obtain the optimum PTS. In the proposed method, we introduce a coded side information technique assuming the pseudo-optimum condition into the PTS. The total calculation cost becomes drastically reduced and side information bits for recovering original data in demodulation.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is one of the best candidates to realize cognitive networks because of its characteristic of agile frequency bands access. In this paper, a novel power allocation model for OFDM-based Cognitive Networks (CR) is presented. An water-filling algorithm is proposed to realize power and subcarrier allocation together with bit loading in OFDM-based CR networks; during power allocation, mutual interference between Primary User (PU) and Secondary User (SU) are comprehensively considered, which restrains the interference to PU together with maximizing the capacity of SU. Symbol Error Rate (SER), power consumption and coverage are considered as Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, and all of them can be ensured in the power allocation. By a simplified model, simulation result is exhibited to illuminate the influence of mutual interference on subcarrier and power allocation together with system capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Maximized Power Allocation for Secondary Users in OFDM-Based Cognitive Networks","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2008.4700164","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4691017/4700142/04700164.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2008.4700164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700142","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Maximized Power Allocation for Secondary Users in OFDM-Based Cognitive Networks","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700164/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10412854","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Maximized Power Allocation for Secondary Users in OFDM-Based Cognitive Networks","confLoc":"Vientiane, Laos","sourcePdf":"ISCIT-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108652S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4691017","isNumber":"4700142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4691017","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4700142","articleId":"4700164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4700165,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Liu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE,Wireless Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37654362900"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE,Wireless Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"ShaoHua Kan","affiliation":[" School of Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, China"],"firstName":"ShaoHua","lastName":"Kan","id":"37663291700"},{"name":"Yabin Ye","affiliation":["Create-Net International Research Center, Italy"],"firstName":"Yabin","lastName":"Ye","id":"37279356900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2335-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2336-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4700165","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Chromium","Cognitive radio","Turning","Protection","Interference cancellation","Bandwidth","Tin","Shape control","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","encoding","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM subcarriers coding","spectrum notch","flexible spectrum shaping","cognitive radio","signaling method","intercarrier interference"]}],"abstract":"Because of its flexible spectrum shaping, OFDM technologies can be used for cognitive radio as signaling method.

However, the prediction of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever outbreak needs the analysis from experts which is inconvenient and costly. An automatic prediction system should be developed. This paper proposes an automatic prediction system of Dengue Haemorrhagic-Fever outbreak risk by using entropy technique and artificial neural network. In this system, the information extraction is preprocessed prior to the prediction in order to reduce data redundancy and retain only those relevant data. First, the external factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall are considered during the information extraction. Then, a supervised neural network is deployed to predict the possible risk of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever outbreak. To evaluate the performance of proposed system, the experiments based on the condition of weather data and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever cases from January 1999 until December 2007 were conducted. Our prediction achieves 85.92% accuracy compared to the actual data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700184/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10412874","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700184/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic Prediction System of Dengue Haemorrhagic-Fever Outbreak Risk by Using Entropy and Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Prediction System of Dengue Haemorrhagic-Fever Outbreak Risk by Using Entropy and Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Vientiane, Laos","sourcePdf":"ISCIT-00-42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046603S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4691017","isNumber":"4700142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4691017","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4700142","articleId":"4700184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4700190,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghai Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on ISN, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Qinghai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37288952900"},{"name":"Kyung Sup Kwak","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, INHA University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Sup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"},{"name":"Fenglin Fu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on ISN, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Fenglin","lastName":"Fu","id":"37411388800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2335-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2336-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4700190","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Frequency estimation","Space technology","Least squares approximation","Throughput","Physical layer","Diversity reception","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","STBC MB-OFDM UWB systems","superimposed training","space time block coded systems","multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","ultra-wideband systems","optimal training symbols","least square channel estimate mean square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["STBC","channel estimation","MB-OFDM","UWB"]}],"abstract":"A novel channel estimation scheme based on superimposed training is proposed for space time block coded (STBCO) multi-band (MB) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) ultra-wideband (UWB) systems.

This amplifier is succeeded by an output buffer to achieve a better linearity, high output swing and required output impedance for matching.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2008.4700229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2008.4700229","startPage":"432","endPage":"435","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4691017/4700142/04700229.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Bandwidth Enhancement Technique for Cascode Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Bandwidth Enhancement Technique for Cascode Amplifier","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700229/","accessionNumber":"10412919","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700229/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Bandwidth Enhancement Technique for Cascode Amplifier","confLoc":"Vientiane, Laos","sourcePdf":"ISCIT-00-87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033054S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4691017","isNumber":"4700142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4691017","xplore-issue":"4700142","articleId":"4700229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4700236,"authors":[{"name":"Direk Sueaseenak","affiliation":["Research Center for Communication and Information Technology (ReCCIT), and Department of Electronics,Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Direk","lastName":"Sueaseenak","id":"37570021100"},{"name":"Sunu Wibirama","affiliation":["Research Center for Communication and Information Technology (ReCCIT), and Department of Electronics,Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sunu","lastName":"Wibirama","id":"37570011300"},{"name":"Theerasak Chanwimalueang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Srinakharinwirot University, Nakhon Nayok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Theerasak","lastName":"Chanwimalueang","id":"37570022900"},{"name":"Chuchart Pintavirooj","affiliation":["Research Center for Communication and Information Technology (ReCCIT), and Department of Electronics,Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chuchart","lastName":"Pintavirooj","id":"37298455700"},{"name":"Manus Sangworasil","affiliation":["Research Center for Communication and Information Technology (ReCCIT), and Department of Electronics,Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Manus","lastName":"Sangworasil","id":"37295629500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2335-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2336-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4700236","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700236","abstract":"We developed a multi-channel electromyogram acquisition system using PSOC microcontroller to acquire multi-channel EMG signals.

B-spline interpolation technique has been utilized to map the EMG signal on the muscle surface. The topological mapping of the EMG is then analyzed to classify the pattern of muscle contraction using independent component analysis. The proposed system was successfully demonstrated to record EMG data and its surface mapping. The comparison study of muscular contraction classification using independent component analysis and artificial neural network demonstrates shows that performance of ANN classification is as comparable as that of the ICA. The computational time of ANN is also less than that of the ICA.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2008.4700236","startPage":"468","endPage":"472","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4691017/4700142/04700236.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2008.4700236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison Study of Muscular-Contraction Classification Between Independent Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Independent component analysis","Artificial neural networks","Electromyography","Muscles","Electrodes","Microcontrollers","Wire","Needles","Instruments","Spline"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","biomedical electrodes","data acquisition","electromyography","independent component analysis","interpolation","medical signal processing","microcontrollers","neural nets","signal classification","splines (mathematics)","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["muscular-contraction pattern classification","independent component analysis","artificial neural network","multichannel electromyogram acquisition system","PSOC microcontroller","EMG signal","surface electrode","back-propagation","B-spline interpolation technique","muscle surface","topological mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EMG","PCA","ICA","ANN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison Study of Muscular-Contraction Classification Between Independent Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700236/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10412926","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison Study of Muscular-Contraction Classification Between Independent Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Vientiane, Laos","sourcePdf":"ISCIT-00-94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051445S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4691017","isNumber":"4700142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4691017","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4700142","articleId":"4700236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4700251,"authors":[{"name":"Sreehari Veeramachaneni","affiliation":["Centre for VLSI and Embedded System Technologies, International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad Gachibowli, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Sreehari","lastName":"Veeramachaneni","id":"37289809600"},{"name":"M.B.

We develop analytical models for the total energy consumption and packet latency for both schemes and analyse the proposed MAC protocol in term of the total energy consumption and packet latency with imperfect synchronisation due to clock jitter. The impact of the clock jitter, the check interval and the number of cooperative nodes on the total energy consumption and latency are investigated.

With the help of multiple secondary users (SU) in the cognitive radio network, various cooperative sensing schemes are investigated to enhance the energy detection performance. However, the impacts of noise power fluctuating effects on the detection performance in multipath fading and user cooperative sensing scenarios are seldom evaluated in relevant literature. In this paper, a modified version of the classic energy detection model is presented, where the noise power uncertainty (U) is introduced into threshold setting. With a reasonable approximate derivation, we provide accurate predictions of SNRwall constraints imposed by U in Rayleigh fading environments. In addition, by employing a simple hard decision fusion rule, the collaborative gain in spectrum sensing performance is also quantified with respect to U. Our analysis and numerical results confirm that collaboration can significantly improve the spectrum sensing performance in a noise power fluctuating environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700269/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10412959","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700269/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy Detection Based Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios in Noise of Uncertain Power","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Detection Based Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios in Noise of Uncertain Power","confLoc":"Vientiane, Laos","sourcePdf":"ISCIT-00-127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079581S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4691017","isNumber":"4700142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4691017","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4700142","articleId":"4700269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4700284,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Yeul Park","affiliation":["Future Energy Electronics Center, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, State University of Virginia, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4712525/4700284/4700284-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sung-Yeul Park (S'04) received M.S degree in electrical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Since 2004, he has been a Research Assistant at the Future Energy Electronics Center (FEEC), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

The key to achieving lagging power flow control is to ensure sufficiently high enough DC bus voltage to avoid duty cycle saturation.

In this paper, the current loop transfer function has been systematically derived for the controller design purpose. Phasor analysis was adopted to explain the need of dc bus voltage requirement. A 5-kVA grid-tie fuel cell inverter was used as the platform to show current loop controller design and admittance compensation. The proposed controller has been simulated, and the same parameters have been used for a DSP-based controller.

The proposed DPS control consists of a phase shift between the primary and secondary voltages of the isolation transformer, and a phase shift between the gate signals of the diagonal switches of each H-bridge. Simulation on a 600-V/5-kW prototype shows that the DPS control has excellent dynamic and static performance compared to the traditional phase-shift control (single phase shift). In this paper, the concept of ldquoreactive powerrdquo is defined, and the corresponding equations are derived for isolated bidirectional DC-DC converters. It is shown that the reactive power in traditional phase-shift control is inherent, and is the main factor contributing to large peak current and large system loss. The DPS control can eliminate reactive power in isolated bidirectional DC-DC converters. In addition, the DPS control can decrease the peak inrush current and steady-state current, improve system efficiency, increase system power capability (by 33%), and minimize the output capacitance as compared to the traditional phase-shift control. The soft-switching range and the influence of short-time-scale factors, such as deadband and system-level safe operation area, are also discussed in detail. Under certain operation conditions, deadband compensation can be implemented easily in the DPS control without a current sensor.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4712525/04700286.pdf","startPage":"2905","endPage":"2914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eliminate Reactive Power and Increase System Efficiency of Isolated Bidirectional Dual-Active-Bridge DC\u2013DC Converters Using Novel Dual-Phase-Shift Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Eliminate Reactive Power and Increase System Efficiency of Isolated Bidirectional Dual-Active-Bridge DC\u2013DC Converters Using Novel Dual-Phase-Shift Control","volume":"23","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700286/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10370085","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700286/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eliminate Reactive Power and Increase System Efficiency of Isolated Bidirectional Dual-Active-Bridge DC\u2013DC Converters Using Novel Dual-Phase-Shift Control","sourcePdf":"tpel-bai-2005103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062167S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4712525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"576","xplore-issue":"4712525","articleId":"4700286","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4700287,"authors":[{"name":"Franco Scarselli","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4740185/4700287/4700287-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Franco Scarselli received the Laurea degree with honors in computer science from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 1989 and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and automation engineering from the University of Florence, Florence, Italy, in 1994.","He has been supported by foundations of private and public companies and by a postdoctoral of the University of Florence.

An RBF neural network with a three-layer feed-forward structure is employed to learn the relationship between the statement coverage of a test case and its corresponding execution result. The trained network is then given as input a set of virtual test cases, each covering only a single statement. The output of the network for each test case is considered to be the suspiciousness of the corresponding statement; a statement with a higher suspiciousness has a higher likelihood of containing a bug. The set of statements ranked in descending order by their suspiciousness are then examined by programmers one by one until a bug is located. Three case studies on different programs (space, grep and make) were conducted with each faulty version having exactly one bug. An additional program gcc was also used to demonstrate the concept of extending the proposed method to programs with multiple bugs. Our experimental data suggest that an RBF neural network-based fault localization method is more effective in locating a program bug (by examining less code before the first faulty statement containing the bug is identified) than another popular method, Tarantula, which also uses the coverage and execution results to compute the suspiciousness of each statement.","doi":"10.1109/ISSRE.2008.15","startPage":"27","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSRE.2008.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700289","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700288/4700289/04700307.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using an RBF Neural Network to Locate Program Bugs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700307/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using an RBF Neural Network to Locate Program Bugs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700307/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10414505","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","conferenceDate":"10-14 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using an RBF Neural Network to Locate Program Bugs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"3405a027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112277S","chronDate":"10-14 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700288","isNumber":"4700289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700288","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4700289","articleId":"4700307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":4700314,"authors":[{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Michael R.

When deployed to a new platform, the software incurs low configuration cost because no extensive performance measurements and profiling are required. To strive for efficiency, a threshold-based approach is adopted. In this paper, we systematically study this approach and its design decisions.","publicationTitle":"2008 Real-Time Systems Symposium","startPage":"323","endPage":"332","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2008.31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2008.31","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700407/4700408/04700446.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Real-Time Systems Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Power Management of Heterogeneous Soft Real-Time Clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700446/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Power Management of Heterogeneous Soft Real-Time Clusters","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10414612","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700446/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Power Management of Heterogeneous Soft Real-Time Clusters","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3477a323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057126S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700407","isNumber":"4700408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700407","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4700408","articleId":"4700446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4700456,"authors":[{"name":"Weihuan Shu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Weihuan","lastName":"Shu","id":"37578338200"},{"name":"Xue Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292951400"},{"name":"Zonghua Gu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zonghua","lastName":"Gu","id":"37291583600"},{"name":"Sathish Gopalakrishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Sathish","lastName":"Gopalakrishnan","id":"37272873000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3477-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1052-8725"}],"articleNumber":"4700456","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Wireless sensor networks","Resource management","Routing","Utility programs","Aggregates","System performance","Constraint optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Distributed algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network routing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal sampling rate assignment","dynamic route selection","real-time wireless sensor networks","real-time sampling rate assignment problem","static routing environment","network utility maximization framework","constrained optimization problem","primal-dual method","dual decomposition technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Utility Maximization","Resource Allocation","Dynamic Routing","Real-Time Routing","Wireless Sensor Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700456","abstract":"The allocation of computation and communication resources in a manner that optimizes aggregate system performance is a crucial aspect of system management. Wireless sensor network poses new challenges due to the resource constraints and real-time requirements. Existing work has dealt with the real-time sampling rate assignment problem, under single processor case and network case with static routing environment. For wireless sensor networks, in order to achieve better overall network performance, routing should be considered together with the rate assignments of individual flows. In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing sampling rates with dynamic route selection for wireless sensor networks. We model the problem as a constrained optimization problem and solve it under the network utility maximization framework. Based on the primal-dual method and dual decomposition technique, we design a distributed algorithm that achieves the optimal global network utility considering both dynamic route decision and rate assignment. Extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed solutions.","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2008.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2008.22","startPage":"431","endPage":"441","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700407/4700408/04700456.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Real-Time Systems Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Sampling Rate Assignment with Dynamic Route Selection for Real-Time Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Sampling Rate Assignment with Dynamic Route Selection for Real-Time Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700456/","accessionNumber":"10414621","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700456/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Sampling Rate Assignment with Dynamic Route Selection for Real-Time Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3477a431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076223S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700407","isNumber":"4700408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700407","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4700408","articleId":"4700456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4700501,"authors":[{"name":"Vishal Dwivedi","affiliation":["SETLabs, Infosys Technologies Limited"],"firstName":"Vishal","lastName":"Dwivedi","id":"37661326500"},{"name":"Naveen Kulkarni","affiliation":["SETLabs, Infosys Technologies Limited"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Kulkarni","id":"37546923100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3313-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4700501","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Service oriented architecture","Business communication","Automation","SQUIDs","Spine","Unified modeling language","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","software architecture","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven service identification","process centric systems","Web-services","SOA based system","business services","service oriented architecture","business processes","SQUID automation tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Service Identification","Heuristics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700501","abstract":"The raison dpsilaetre for Web-services is that they could be used to compose new services. As in process centric systems, wherein blocks of software implement a functional domain through a set of linked activities, a SOA based system modeled through Web-services, requires business services (of low granularity) which implement various business functions. Such business services could not only ensure a high degree of re-use but could also help in realizing service oriented architecture in its true sense. Although today quite a few approaches for the problem exist, but most of them are bottom up solutions, or mainly focus on domain decomposition and composite service formation. Not many of them have yet utilized the full potential of business processes, which form the backbone of any enterprise. In this work we define what a business service would be like, vis-a-vis its corresponding business function, and how it could be realized through data, utility, information and other services. We present our service identification approach which utilizes process maps and service hierarchies and towards the end we discuss some of our current work in building an automation tool (named SQUID) for service identification.","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES-2.2008.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES-2.2008.16","startPage":"65","endPage":"72","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Congress on Services Part II (services-2 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700468/4700469/04700501.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Congress on Services Part II (services-2 2008)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model Driven Service Identification Approach for Process Centric Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Model Driven Service Identification Approach for Process Centric Systems","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700501/","accessionNumber":"10414633","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700501/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model Driven Service Identification Approach for Process Centric Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3313a065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093356S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700468","isNumber":"4700469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700468","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4700469","articleId":"4700501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4700555,"authors":[{"name":"A.

They consist in creating a fault dictionary that is used to determine the correspondence between the signature and the fault models affecting the memory. The effectiveness of such diagnosis methods is therefore strictly related to the fault dictionary accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, most of existing signature-based diagnosis approaches targets static faults only. In this paper, we present a new diagnosis approach that represents an alternative to signature-based approaches. This new diagnosis technique, named history-based diagnosis, makes use of the effect-cause paradigm already developed for logic design diagnosis. It consists in creating a database containing the history of operations (read and write) performed on a faulty memory core-cell. This information is crucial to track the root cause of the observed faulty behavior and it can be used to generate the set of possible fault primitives representing the set of suspected fault models. This new diagnosis method is able to identify static as well as dynamic faults. Although applied to SRAMs in this paper, it can be effective also for other memory types such as DRAMs. Experimental results are provided to prove the efficiency of the proposed methodology in generating a list of suspected faults as well as the location of the faulty components in the memory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A History-Based Diagnosis Technique for Static and Dynamic Faults in SRAMs","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2008.4700555","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2008.4700555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700527","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4690905/4700527/04700555.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A History-Based Diagnosis Technique for Static and Dynamic Faults in SRAMs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700555/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10412695","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A History-Based Diagnosis Technique for Static and Dynamic Faults in SRAMs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TEST-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085605S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4690905","isNumber":"4700527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4690905","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4700527","articleId":"4700555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4700556,"authors":[{"name":"W.

By adding a limited number of spare cores to replace defective cores either before shipment or in the field, the effective yield of the chip and its overall cost can be significantly improved. In this paper, we propose a yield and cost analysis framework to better understand the dependency of a multi-core chip's cost on key parameters such as the number of cores and spares, core yield, and defect coverage of manufacturing and in-field testing. Our analysis shows that we can eliminate the burn-in process when we have some spare cores for in-field recovery. We demonstrate that a high defect coverage for in-field testing, a necessity for supporting in-field recovery, is essential for overall cost reduction. We also illustrate that, with in-field recovery capability, the reliance on high quality manufacturing testing is significantly reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4690905/4700527/04700562.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2008.4700562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2008.4700562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cost Analysis Framework for Multi-core Systems with Spares","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Programmable logic arrays","Virtual manufacturing","Manufacturing processes","System testing","Pulp manufacturing","Multicore processing","Logic devices","Field programmable gate arrays","Automatic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost reduction","electronic equipment manufacture","electronic equipment testing","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost analysis","multicore systems","manufacturing yield","multicore chips","in-field testing","cost reduction","manufacturing testing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Cost Analysis Framework for Multi-core Systems with Spares","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700562/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10412702","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cost Analysis Framework for Multi-core Systems with Spares","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TEST-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06792S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4690905","isNumber":"4700527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4690905","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4700527","articleId":"4700562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4700583,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroaki Inoue","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stanford University; System IP Core Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Inoue"},{"name":"Yanjing Li","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Stanford","Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stanford University"],"firstName":"Yanjing","lastName":"Li","id":"37405719600"},{"name":"Subhasish Mitra","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Stanford","Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stanford University"],"firstName":"Subhasish","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37276204700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2402-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2403-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4700583","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":377},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VAST: Virtualization-Assisted Concurrent Autonomous Self-Test","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4690905/4700527/04700583.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2008.4700583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700527","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2008.4700583","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Built-in self-test","System testing","Circuit testing","Automatic testing","Large-scale systems","Robustness","Hardware","Computer architecture","Design optimization","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","circuit testing","concurrent engineering","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VAST","virtualization-assisted concurrent autonomous self-test","online self-test","large-scale robust systems","circuit failure prediction","failure detection","self-healing","virtualization software","built-in self-test"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700583","abstract":"Virtualization-assisted concurrent, autonomous self-test, or VAST, enables a multi-/many-core system to test itself, concurrently during normal operation, without any user-visible downtime.

As a result, optimized trade-offs in system design complexity, system performance and power impact, and test thoroughness are possible. Experimental results from an actual multi-core system demonstrate that: 1. VAST is practical and effective; and, 2. Special VAST-supported self-test policies enable extremely thorough on-line self-test with very small performance impact.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10412723","htmlLink":"/document/4700583/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"VAST: Virtualization-Assisted Concurrent Autonomous Self-Test","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VAST: Virtualization-Assisted Concurrent Autonomous Self-Test","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TEST-00-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073058S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4690905","isNumber":"4700527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4690905","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4700527","articleId":"4700583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4700601,"authors":[{"name":"Ganesh Srinivasan","affiliation":["TI Boulevard, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ganesh","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"37274518400"},{"name":"Hui-Chuan Chao","affiliation":["TI Boulevard, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hui-Chuan","lastName":"Chao","id":"37651672000"},{"name":"Friedrich Taenzler","affiliation":["TI Boulevard, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Friedrich","lastName":"Taenzler","id":"37391331300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2402-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2403-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4700601","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Transceivers","Radio frequency","Costs","Integrated circuit testing","Production","OFDM","System testing","Manufacturing","Radiofrequency integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test equipment","OFDM modulation","transceivers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["octal-site EVM test","WLAN transceiver","ATE platform","OFDM based broadband EVM test","error vector magnitude","automatic test equipment","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless LAN"]}],"abstract":"Present day needs of RF IC manufactures for EVM tests in production testing from engineering and customer perspectives strongly demands massive parallel testing.

In our approach, EVM is modeled as a function of the system static non-idealities (IQ mismatch, gain, IIP3 parameters) and dynamic non-idealities (system noise, VCO phase noise). Using a selected subset of the OFDM tones, the static parameters are calculated first. These are then used to facilitate noise estimation using a back-end constellation compensation and noise amplification procedure. The data generated is used to predict EVM using machine learning methods. Significant reduction in test time is achieved with little loss in test accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2008.4700603","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4690905/4700527/04700603.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2008.4700603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EVM Testing of Wireless OFDM Transceivers Using Intelligent Back-End Digital Signal Processing Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700603/","displayDocTitle":"EVM Testing of Wireless OFDM Transceivers Using Intelligent Back-End Digital Signal Processing Algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10412743","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700603/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EVM Testing of Wireless OFDM Transceivers Using Intelligent Back-End Digital Signal Processing Algorithms","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TEST-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072317S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4690905","isNumber":"4700527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4690905","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4700527","articleId":"4700603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4700604,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Eichenberger","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Eichenberger","id":"38365197200"},{"name":"Jeroen Geuzebroek","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jeroen","lastName":"Geuzebroek","id":"37658456400"},{"name":"Camelia Hora","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Camelia","lastName":"Hora","id":"37330603200"},{"name":"Bram Kruseman","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bram","lastName":"Kruseman","id":"37281685400"},{"name":"Ananta Majhi","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ananta","lastName":"Majhi","id":"37348213300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2402-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2403-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4700604","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor device testing","Automatic test pattern generation","Circuit faults","Acceleration","Guidelines","Test pattern generators","Mass production","Fault diagnosis","Pattern analysis","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","fault diagnosis","integrated circuit testing","integrated circuit yield","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["volume scan diagnosis","yield learning","test quality learning","learning cycle","test pattern generation","adequate fault models","probabilistic methods","N-detect"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700604","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2008.4700604","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","abstract":"With test quality being an imperative, this paper presents a methodology on how to apply volume scan diagnosis - known from the field of yield learning - to the domain of test quality learning.

In order to measure SCFV, novel design-for-test (DFT) techniques with asymmetric cell-bias-voltage modulation (ACBVM) are introduced, in which the cell-data retention is measured with sweeping potential of a ground node connected to one of the cross-coupled invertors of a cell and source voltage of PMOS loads swept. It is shown that SCFV has high correlation with conventional static noise margin (SNM). The proposed techniques make it possible to directly obtain large amounts of stability data of memory cells arranged in matrix for an SRAM macro, which has been difficult with conventional SNM measurements. The measured data of 1 Kb SRAM with 65 nm technology show good correspondence with simulated results.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2008.4700616","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4690905/4700527/04700616.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2008.4700616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Cell-Stability Test Techniques for an SRAM Macro with Asymmetric Cell-Bias-Voltage Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Direct Cell-Stability Test Techniques for an SRAM Macro with Asymmetric Cell-Bias-Voltage Modulation","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700616/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10412756","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Cell-Stability Test Techniques for an SRAM Macro with Asymmetric Cell-Bias-Voltage Modulation","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TEST-00-89.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078535S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4690905","isNumber":"4700527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4690905","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4700527","articleId":"4700616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4700617,"authors":[{"name":"Tsu-Wei Tseng","affiliation":["Advanced Reliable Systems (ARES) Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsu-Wei","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37397370100"},{"name":"Jin-Fu Li","affiliation":["Advanced Reliable Systems (ARES) Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Fu","lastName":"Li","id":"37279861800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2402-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2403-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4700617","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Circuit testing","Costs","Redundancy","System-on-a-chip","Automatic testing","Transistors","Manufacturing","Hardware","Read-write memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","embedded systems","logic design","logic testing","random-access storage","redundancy","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded memories","shared parallel built-in self-repair scheme","random access memories","system-on-chip design","multiple RAM","time-multiplexed built-in redundancy analyzer","chip-level control","shared parallel BISR circuits"]}],"abstract":"Embedded memories currently constitute a significant portion of the chip area for typical system-on-chip (SOC) designs. Built-in self-repair (BISR) techniques have been widely used for enhancing the yield of embedded memories. This paper proposes a shared parallel BISR scheme for random access memories (RAMs) in SOCs. The shared parallel BISR can test and repair multiple RAMs simultaneously. A global time-multiplexed built-in redundancy analyzer (TM-BIRA) is used to allocate redundancies of the RAMs under test and repair. We also design a 1500-compatible wrapper for chip-level control of the shared parallel BISR circuits. In comparison with the dedicated parallel BISR scheme (each memory has a self-contained BISR circuit), the proposed parallel BISR scheme can achieve 20% reduction of area cost by paying additional 0.005% test and repair time for serving 5 RAMs with spare rows and spare columns.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2008.4700617","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4690905/4700527/04700617.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2008.4700617","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Shared Parallel Built-In Self-Repair Scheme for Random Access Memories in SOCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Shared Parallel Built-In Self-Repair Scheme for Random Access Memories in SOCs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700617/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700617/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10412757","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Shared Parallel Built-In Self-Repair Scheme for Random Access Memories in SOCs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TEST-00-90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065745S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4690905","isNumber":"4700527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4690905","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4700527","articleId":"4700617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4700619,"authors":[{"name":"Mridul Agarwal","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc."],"firstName":"Mridul","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37430239100"},{"name":"Varsha Balakrishnan","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Varsha","lastName":"Balakrishnan","id":"37663109000"},{"name":"Anshuman Bhuyan","affiliation":["University of Stanford"],"firstName":"Anshuman","lastName":"Bhuyan","id":"37658494800"},{"name":"Kyunglok Kim","affiliation":["University of Stanford"],"firstName":"Kyunglok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37656493400"},{"name":"Bipul C.

In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate correct functionality and practicality of two flavors of flip-flop designs with built-in aging sensors using 90 nm test chips. We also present an aging-aware timing analysis technique to strategically place such flip-flops with built-in aging sensors at selective locations inside a chip for effective circuit failure prediction.

as SIP, MCP, and WSP. In terms of the package assembly cost, these package products are required to adopt the KGD (known good die) quality level. However, the KGD requires a long burn-in time, added testing time, and high cost equipments. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents a statistical wafer burn-in methodology for the latent defect screen in the wafer test process. The newly proposed methodology consists of a defect-based wafer burn-in (DB-WBI) stress method based on DRAM operation characteristics and a statistical stress optimization method using RSM (response surface method) on the DRAM manufacturing test process. Experimental data shows that package test yields in the immature fabrication process improved by up to 6%. In addition, experimental results show that the proposed methodology can guarantee reliability requirements with a shortened package burn-in time. In conclusion, this methodology realizes a simplified manufacturing test process supporting time to market with high reliability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Wafer Level Latent Defect Screening Methodology for Highly Reliable DRAM Using a Response Surface Method","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2008.4700632","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2008.4700632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700527","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4690905/4700527/04700632.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A New Wafer Level Latent Defect Screening Methodology for Highly Reliable DRAM Using a Response Surface Method","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700632/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10412772","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Wafer Level Latent Defect Screening Methodology for Highly Reliable DRAM Using a Response Surface Method","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TEST-00-105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101895S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4690905","isNumber":"4700527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4690905","xplore-issue":"4700527","articleId":"4700632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4700635,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37403479500"},{"name":"Tao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37411446600"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2402-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2403-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4700635","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"abstract":"Dependability is an important system attribute for microfluidic lab-on-chip.

We present a built-in self-test (BIST) method for digital microfluidic lab-on-chip. This method utilizes digital microfluidic logic gates to implement the BIST architecture; AND, OR and NOT gates are used to compress test-outcome droplets into one droplet signature. This approach obviates the need for capacitive sensing test-outcome circuits for analysis. An efficient diagnosis method based on a microfluidic encoder is also proposed to locate a single defective electrode in a microfluidic array.

Recently, PUFs received a great deal of attention as security mechanisms due to their flexibility to form numerous security protocols and intrinsic resiliency against physical and side channels attacks. We study three classes of PUFs properties to design pertinent test methods: (i) predictability, (ii) sensitivity to component accuracy, and (iii) susceptibility to reverse engineering. As our case studies, we analyze two popular PUF structures, linear and feed-forward, and show that their security is not adequate from several points of view. The technical highlights of the paper are the first non-destructive technique for PUF reverse engineering and a new PUF structure that is capable of passing our security tests.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2008.4700636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2008.4700636","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4690905/4700527/04700636.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing Techniques for Hardware Security","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700636/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Testing Techniques for Hardware Security","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10412776","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4700636/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing Techniques for Hardware Security","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TEST-00-109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115333S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4690905","isNumber":"4700527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4690905","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"4700527","articleId":"4700636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4700648,"authors":[{"name":"Intaik Park","affiliation":["Center for Reliable Computing, University of Stanford, Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Intaik","lastName":"Park","id":"37415529800"},{"name":"Edward J.

Both signals share a single fiber link and the same light source by exploiting optical carrier remodulaiton. Moreover, there is no need to employ RF down-conversion technology for RoF uplink. This makes the proposed system simpler and more cost-effective.

To regulate the behavior of PH systems it is natural to adopt a Passivity-Based Control (PBC) perspective, where the control objectives are achieved shaping the energy function and adding dissipation. In this paper we consider the PBC techniques of Control by Interconnection (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CbI</i>\n) and Standard PBC. In \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CbI</i>\n the controller is another PH system connected to the plant (through a power-preserving interconnection) to add up their energy functions, while in Standard PBC energy shaping is achieved via static state feedback. In spite of the conceptual appeal of formulating the control problem as the interaction of dynamical systems, the current version of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CbI</i>\n imposes a severe restriction on the plant dissipation structure that stymies its practical application. On the other hand, Standard PBC, which is usually derived from a uninspiring and non-intuitive ldquopassive output generationrdquo viewpoint, is one of the most successful controller design techniques. The main objectives of this paper are: (1) To extend the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CbI</i>\n method to make it more widely applicable-in particular, to overcome the aforementioned dissipation obstacle.

We are interested in the tracking performance, defined as the integral square of the tracking error response between the system's output and the reference input. This performance is deemed the best achievable by a sampled-data controller with a linear time-invariant discrete-time compensator if it is the minimal attainable by all such controllers that stabilize the system. Our primary objective is to investigate the fundamental tracking performance limit in sampled-data systems, and to understand whether and how sampling and hold in a sampled-data system may impose intrinsic barriers to performance. We consider two tracking performance measures, with one defined with respect to the unit step signal, and another with respect to a delayed step signal and averaged over one sampling period. We derive an analytical closed-form expression in each case for the best achievable performance. The results show that a performance loss is generally incurred in a sampled-data system, in comparison to the tracking performance achievable by analog controllers. This loss of performance, as so demonstrated by the expressions, is attributed to the non-minimum phase behaviors as well as the intersample effects generated by samplers and hold devices. Thus, sampled-data controllers do result in an additional performance limit, which is seen as a necessary tradeoff for other advantages offered by this class of controllers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Performance loss","Error correction","Sampling methods","Optimal control","Delay","Performance analysis","Closed-form solution","Signal design","Digital control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","discrete time systems","linear systems","sampled data systems","signal sampling","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled-data control system","error response tracking","linear time-invariant discrete-time compensator","closed-form expression","step reference signal tracking problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discretization","frequency-domain lifting","intersample effects","non-minimum phase zeros","performance limit","sampled-data systems","tracking"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.2008.2006924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4700835/04700850.pdf","startPage":"2467","endPage":"2479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2008.2006924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Best Achievable Tracking Performance in Sampled-Data Systems via LTI Controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4700850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Best Achievable Tracking Performance in Sampled-Data Systems via LTI Controllers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700850/","volume":"53","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4700850/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10370459","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Best Achievable Tracking Performance in Sampled-Data Systems via LTI Controllers","sourcePdf":"tac-chen-2006924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07091S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4700835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4700835","articleId":"4700850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4700861,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/4700835/4700861/4700861-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Yang (S'07) received the B.S. degree in theoretical and applied mechanics from Peking University, Beijing, China in 2003 and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering at Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.","His research interests include nonlinear control theory, distributed algorithms, and multi-agent systems."]},"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37289359200"},{"name":"Randy A.

Switching laws are constructed by using the directional derivatives along the trajectories of the subsystems. Conditions for stabilization are established with careful consideration of sliding modes and directional derivatives along sliding modes. Three types of composite quadratic Lyapunov functions, the max of quadratics, the min of quadratics and the convex hull of quadratics are used for deriving matrix conditions of stabilization and for constructing switching laws. Dual stabilization results are established with respect to the pair of conjugate Lyapunov functions: the max of quadratics and the convex hull of quadratics. Conditions of stabilization are derived as bilinear matrix inequalities and solved with LMI-based numerical tools. Relationship between the newly derived conditions and some existing conditions are investigated. It is observed that the min of quadratics, which is nondifferentiable and nonconvex, may be a more convenient tool than the other two types of functions which are convex and/or differentiable. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the synthesis results and the advantage of the composite quadratic functions over existing multiple Lyapunov functions. In particular, better results have been obtained when the number of quadratic functions is greater than the number of subsystems.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2008.2006933","startPage":"2571","endPage":"2585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2008.2006933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4700835","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4700835/04700867.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilization of Switched Systems via Composite Quadratic Functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4700867/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stabilization of Switched Systems via Composite Quadratic Functions","volume":"53","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4700867/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10370472","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilization of Switched Systems via Composite Quadratic Functions","sourcePdf":"tac-lin-2006933.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098774S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4700835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4700835","articleId":"4700867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":4702764,"authors":[{"name":"John O'Brien","affiliation":["Moog, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"O'Brien","id":"37664313000"},{"name":"Amit Kulshreshtha","affiliation":["Moog, Chatsworth, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Kulshreshtha","id":"37659767100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2207-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2208-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7195"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"4702764","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed control","Communication system control","Aerospace control","Power line communications","Actuators","Power system reliability","Programmable control","Control systems","Aerospace electronics","Power cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","aircraft computers","carrier transmission on power lines","distributed control","electric actuators","hydraulic actuators","local area networks","programmable controllers","protocols","servomechanisms","telecontrol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","remote control","flight control actuation","power line communications","servo-hydraulic actuator control","electric actuator control","integrated modular avionics","flight control electronics","modulation schemes","communications protocol","coupling circuitry","star topology","multiple redundant switches","switched Ethernet"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4702764","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2008.4702764","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/AIAA 27th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","abstract":"This paper will review distributed architecture of flight control system addressing remote control of the actuator control for conventional servo-hydraulics and electric actuators from functional performance, safety/reliability including availability/fault tolerance etc. This paper will review the concept of power line communication (PLC) and its relevance as a communication scheme for integrated modular avionics (IMA) based Flight Control Electronics addressing remote actuation control and monitoring in particular.

Investigations for the broadband aeronautical multi-carrier communications (B-AMC) [1] system, one candidate for the broadband L-DACS, have shown that interference originating from DME systems operating in adjacent channels has a strong impact on the B-AMC system. To enable the utilization of spectral gaps between two adjacent DME channels, two efficient methods for mitigating the impact of interference are proposed and investigated for the B-AMC system, namely pulse blanking and erasure based decoding. Simulations show that the impact of DME interference onto the L-DACS can be reduced considerably by choosing an appropriate coding scheme to make the transmit signal robust against interference. The impact of interference is mitigated by means of the proposed methods, resulting in a performance close to the performance in the interference-free case.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2008.4702777","pdfPath":"/iel5/4694773/4702732/04702777.pdf","startPage":"2.B.2-1","endPage":"2.B.2-12","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/AIAA 27th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/AIAA 27th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2008.4702777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4702732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference mitigation for broadband L-DACS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4702777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Interference mitigation for broadband L-DACS","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10412230","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4702777/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference mitigation for broadband L-DACS","confLoc":"St. Paul, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12042008-00045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056642S","chronDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4694773","isNumber":"4702732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4694773","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4702732","articleId":"4702777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4702779,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["Lockheed Martin TSS, Rockville, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Yang Wang","id":"37657547200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2207-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2208-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7195"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"4702779","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Air traffic control","Engines","Communication system traffic control","Technology management","Digital systems","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Protocols","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air traffic control","aircraft communication","cognitive radio","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","aeronautical air-ground communication","air traffic control","national airspace system","air-ground voice communications systems","licensed air traffic management VHF spectrum band","static spectrum allocation","static channel assignment","software-defined radio"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio for aeronautical air-ground communication","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2008.4702779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4702732","endPage":"2.B.4-8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/AIAA 27th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/AIAA 27th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4694773/4702732/04702779.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2008.4702779","startPage":"2.B.4-1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4702779","abstract":"The system of air-ground communications is one of the fundamental elements of air traffic control in the national airspace system (NAS). The current air-ground voice communications systems are using the more than 50 year old analog voice transmission technology in the licensed air traffic management VHF spectrum band. The limited spectrum is allocated statically based on air traffic control organization and geographic locations. With the increasing use of data applications for air-ground communications, the demand to effectively use the limited spectrum has increased. There are several proposed approaches to solve the projected saturated spectrum in the future. However, these approaches do not address the current practice of static spectrum allocation, which the author anticipates it will be a major bottleneck for effective use of the limited spectrum. The current static channel assignment creates inefficient use of the limited spectrum. Regardless of whether a channel is used or not, it is permanently assigned to the particular geographical areas and organizations. This prevents other users from using the channels when the channels are idle. Also, this static allocation of the spectrum constrains the reassignment of channels and creates a long transition period for moving the existing analog system to a new digital system. The emerging cognitive radio (CR) technology provides the opportunities to address the static allocation of spectrum issue and offer a more flexible transition approach for updating the legacy air-ground radio system. The emerging CR technology provides sensing of surrounding environment, allowing the radio to adapt to the environment accordingly. Built on software-defined radio (SDR) technology, CR is able to employ these features with the cognitive engine and the aid of several sensors. The cognitive engine carries out these tasks by obtaining all available information from sources such as sensors, protocol layers, a policy engine, and its own hardware, and then interprets, reasons, and makes the optimum decision to adapt. Integrated with ground radio stations and centralized management system, the CR can dynamically use the available channels based on its actual location, environment condition, and, therefore, maximize the use of the limited spectrum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4702779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10412232","htmlLink":"/document/4702779/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio for aeronautical air-ground communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio for aeronautical air-ground communication","confLoc":"St. Paul, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12042008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030929S","chronDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4694773","isNumber":"4702732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4694773","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4702732","articleId":"4702779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4702783,"authors":[{"name":"Savita Veram","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center"],"firstName":"Savita","lastName":"Veram","id":"37659460200"},{"name":"Sandy Lozito","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center"],"firstName":"Sandy","lastName":"Lozito","id":"37621754400"},{"name":"Thomas Kozon","affiliation":["NASA/Raytheon Corporation"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kozon","id":"38534516300"},{"name":"Deborah Ballinger","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center"],"firstName":"Deborah","lastName":"Ballinger","id":"37651040300"},{"name":"Herbert Resnick","affiliation":["Raytheon Corporation"],"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Resnick","id":"37659458200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2207-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2208-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7195"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"4702783","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":109},"abstract":"This study investigated procedures to increase capacity in the terminal area using a high-fidelity flight deck simulator. The concept was developed to achieve visual meteorological condition capacities under instrument meteorological conditions when landing aircraft on runways 750 ft apart. The purpose was to investigate procedures related to breakout maneuvers on final approach during off-nominal conditions. Fifty percent of the simulation runs had an off-nominal situation. The off-nominal situation was either the wake of the lead aircraft drifting too close to the trailing aircraft or the lead aircraft deviating from its course and blundering towards the trailing aircraft. The location of the off-nominal situation was also a variable. Results showed that the workload and situational demands experienced by pilots were higher in the off-nominal as compared to the normal scenario. Pilots executed a breakout maneuver earlier for wake intrusion than for aircraft deviation. The location and cause of the off-nominal situation did not have a significant impact on workload or situation awareness. In general, the pilots flew the breakout maneuver accurately and safely. The results provide an assessment of the procedures for breakout maneuvers during off-nominal conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft navigation","NASA","Instruments","Airports","Meteorology","Radar","Monitoring","Air traffic control","Air transportation","Computer aided software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","aerospace simulation","aerospace test facilities","airports","human factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["off-nominal case","very closely spaced parallel runway operation","terminal area","high-fidelity flight deck simulator","visual meteorological condition","instrument meteorological conditions","breakout maneuvers","final approach","wake intrusion","distance 750 ft"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DASC.2008.4702783","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/AIAA 27th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/AIAA 27th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4694773/4702732/04702783.pdf","startPage":"2.C.4-1","endPage":"2.C.4-11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4702732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2008.4702783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Procedures for off-nominal cases: Very closely spaced parallel runway operations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4702783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Procedures for off-nominal cases: Very closely spaced parallel runway operations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4702783/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4702783/","accessionNumber":"10412236","conferenceDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Procedures for off-nominal cases: Very closely spaced parallel runway operations","confLoc":"St. Paul, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12042008-00051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071236S","chronDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4694773","isNumber":"4702732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4694773","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4702732","articleId":"4702783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4702882,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Sheibanyrad","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory"],"bio":{"p":["Abbas Sheibanyrad is a postdoctoral researcher at TIMA Laboratory in Grenoble, France.

A simple-compensated amplifier with 24.8 GHz bandwidth and having 1013 mW dissipation showed 13.8 dB (S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub>\n) gain and 50.2 dBm OIP3 at (1.950, 1.975 GHz). It is unconditionally stable from DC to 15 GHz, and stable in a 50 Omega system from DC to 50 GHz. A nested-compensated amplifier with 40 GHz bandwidth and having 993 mW dissipation showed 13.8 dB (S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub>\n) gain and 42.8 dBm OIP3 at (1.950, 1.975 GHz). It is unconditionally stable from DC-20 GHz and stable in a 50 Omega system from DC to 50 GHz.

We address considerations important to the application of negative feedback to mm-, microwave amplifiers, including the effects of interface impedances on stability, the effect of feedback upon return losses and noise figure, and the effect of frequency compensation and of feedback topology on closed-loop distortion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4703038/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10422509","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"mm-wave op-amps for low distortion amplification with high OIP3/P<inf>DC</inf> ratio \u226b 100 at 2 GHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"mm-wave op-amps for low distortion amplification with high OIP3/P<inf>DC</inf> ratio \u226b 100 at 2 GHz","confLoc":"Versailles, France","sourcePdf":"SPI-12042008-00146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04228S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4694766","isNumber":"4702892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4694766","xplore-issue":"4702892","articleId":"4703038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4703057,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Hence, low-power clocking schemes are promising approaches for low-power design. We propose four novel energy recovery clocked flip-flops that enable energy recovery from the clock network, resulting in significant energy savings. The proposed flip-flops operate with a single-phase sinusoidal clock, which can be generated with high efficiency. In the TSMC 0.25-mum CMOS technology, we implemented 1024 proposed energy recovery clocked flip-flops through an H-tree clock network driven by a resonant clock-generator to generate a sinusoidal clock. Simulation results show a power reduction of 90% on the clock-tree and total power savings of up to 83% as compared to the same implementation using the conventional square-wave clocking scheme and flip-flops. Using a sinusoidal clock signal for energy recovery prevents application of existing clock gating solutions. In this paper, we also propose clock gating solutions for energy recovery clocking. Applying our clock gating to the energy recovery clocked flip-flops reduces their power by more than 1000times in the idle mode with negligible power and delay overhead in the active mode. Finally, a test chip containing two pipelined multipliers one designed with conventional square wave clocked flip-flops and the other one with the proposed energy recovery clocked flip-flops is fabricated and measured. Based on measurement results, the energy recovery clocking scheme and flip-flops show a power reduction of 71% on the clock-tree and 39% on flip-flops, resulting in an overall power savings of 25% for the multiplier chip.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2008453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4717837/04703179.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2008453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra Low-Power Clocking Scheme Using Energy Recovery and Clock Gating","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Ultra Low-Power Clocking Scheme Using Energy Recovery and Clock Gating","volume":"17","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10369923","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4703179/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703179/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra Low-Power Clocking Scheme Using Energy Recovery and Clock Gating","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mahmoodi-2008453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055745S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4717837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4717837","articleId":"4703179","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4703182,"authors":[{"name":"Alfio Dario Grasso","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e dei Sistemi (DIEES), Universita Catania, Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4749486/4703182/4703182-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alfio Dario Grasso (M'99) was born in Catania, Italy, in 1978.

A new orthogonal projection pursuit (OPP) method, coupled with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, is proposed for augmenting the proposed network. A novel two-stage hybrid training scheme is developed for constructing a parsimonious network model. In the first stage, by applying the OPP algorithm, significant wavelet neurons are adaptively and successively recruited into the network, where adjustable parameters of the associated wavelet neurons are optimized using a particle swarm optimizer. The resultant network model, obtained in the first stage, however, may be redundant. In the second stage, an orthogonal least squares algorithm is then applied to refine and improve the initially trained network by removing redundant wavelet neurons from the network. An example for a real spatio-temporal system identification problem is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed new modeling framework.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4740185/04703194.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice Dynamical Wavelet Neural Networks Implemented Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Spatio\u2013Temporal System Identification","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2009639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2009639","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703194/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Lattice Dynamical Wavelet Neural Networks Implemented Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Spatio\u2013Temporal System Identification","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370361","pubMedId":"19129037","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4703194/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice Dynamical Wavelet Neural Networks Implemented Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Spatio\u2013Temporal System Identification","sourcePdf":"tnn-sbillings-2009639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079387S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4740185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4740185","articleId":"4703194","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4703199,"authors":[{"name":"Micha\u00cbl Defoin Platel","affiliation":["Knowledge Engineering and Research Institute (KEDRI), Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/5342537/4703199/4703199-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Micha\u00ebl Defoin Platel received the M.Sc. degree in bio-informatics from the University of Paris 5, Paris, France, in 1999 and the Ph.D. degree in artificial intelligence from the University of Nice, Nice, France, in 2004.","From 2004 to 2006, he was funded by the CNES (the French National Center for Spatial Studies) to do postdoctoral research on the ocean color inverse problem.

This paper clearly establishes that QEA is an original algorithm that belongs to the class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), while the common points and specifics of QEA compared to other EDAs are highlighted. The behavior of a versatile QEA relatively to three classical EDAs is extensively studied and comparatively good results are reported in terms of loss of diversity, scalability, solution quality, and robustness to fitness noise. To better understand QEA, two main advantages of the multimodel approach are analyzed in details. First, it is shown that QEA can dynamically adapt the learning speed leading to a smooth and robust convergence behavior. Second, we demonstrate that QEA manipulates more complex distributions of solutions than with a single model approach leading to more efficient optimization of problems with interacting variables.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm: A Multimodel EDA","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2008.2003010","endPage":"1232","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5342537/04703199.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"1218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2008.2003010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342537","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703199","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Electronic design automation and methodology","Quantum computing","Clustering algorithms","Ant colony optimization","Genetic algorithms","Noise robustness","Space technology","Space exploration","Mutual information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","evolutionary computation","optimisation","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm","multimodel EDA","quantum computing principle","optimization problems solution","probabilistic model","estimation of distribution algorithm","EDAs class","diversity","scalability","solution quality","multimodel approach","robust convergence behavior","single model approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coarse grained algorithm","optimization","probabilistic models","quantum computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm: A Multimodel EDA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4703199/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"10998923","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm: A Multimodel EDA","sourcePdf":"tevc00-mplatel-2003010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130749S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5342537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5342537","articleId":"4703199","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4703204,"authors":[{"name":"S.-J.

The RD information defines a set of hyperbolic equations from which the source position can be calculated with the knowledge of the sensor positions. Under the standard assumption of Gaussian distributed RD measurement errors, it is well known that the maximum-likelihood (ML) position estimation is achieved by minimizing a multimodal cost function which corresponds to a difficult task. In this correspondence, we propose to approximate the nonconvex ML optimization by relaxing it to a convex optimization problem using semidefinite programming. A semidefinite relaxation RD-based positioning algorithm, which makes use of the admissible source position information, is proposed and its estimation performance is contrasted with the two-step weighted least squares method and nonlinear least squares estimator as well as Cramer-Rao lower bound.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4799349/04703208.pdf","startPage":"1630","endPage":"1633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2010599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2010599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semidefinite Programming Approach for Range-Difference Based Source Localization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","Maximum likelihood estimation","Nonlinear equations","Measurement standards","Cost function","Least squares approximation","Signal processing algorithms","Wireless sensor networks","Position measurement","Measurement errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","hyperbolic equations","least squares approximations","maximum likelihood estimation","nonlinear estimation","optimisation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semidefinite programming","range-difference-based source localization","passive source localization","spatially separated sensors","hyperbolic equations","Gaussian distributed RD measurement errors","maximum-likelihood position estimation","multimodal cost function","nonconvex ML optimization","convex optimization problem","semidefinite relaxation RD-based positioning algorithm","nonlinear least squares estimator","two-step weighted least squares method","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Range-difference measurements","semidefinite programming","source localization","time-delay estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Semidefinite Programming Approach for Range-Difference Based Source Localization","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4703208/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10517082","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semidefinite Programming Approach for Range-Difference Based Source Localization","sourcePdf":"tsp-so-2010599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103896S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4799349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4799349","articleId":"4703208","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":4703209,"authors":[{"name":"Huanfeng Shen","affiliation":["School of Resource and Environmental Science, and State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4815947/4703209/4703209-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huanfeng Shen received the B.S. degree in surveying and mapping engineering and the Ph.D. degree in photogrammetry and remote sensing from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","In July 2007, he is with the School of Resource and Environmental Science, Wuhan University, as an Assistant Professor.

We assign more resources to these earlier classifiers to execute in parallel than to subsequent classifiers. This dramatically improves the total processing speed without a great increase in circuit area. Moreover, the partially parallel execution model achieves flexible processing performance by adjusting the balance of parallel processing.

The first part is the payload while the second part is the auxiliary information package for blind detection. To increase embedding capacity, we have to make the size of the second part as small as possible. Tian's classical DE method has a large auxiliary information package. Thodi mitigated the problem by using a payload-independent overflow location map. However, the compressibility of the overflow location map is still undesirable in some image types. In this paper, we focus on improving the overflow location map. We design a new embedding scheme that helps us construct an efficient payload-dependent overflow location map. Such an overflow location map has good compressibility. Our accurate capacity control capability also reduces unnecessary alteration to the image. Under the same image quality, the proposed algorithm often has larger embedding capacity. It performs well in different types of images, including those where other algorithms often have difficulty in acquiring good embedding capacity and high image quality.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4773451/04703233.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DE-Based Reversible Data Hiding With Improved Overflow Location Map","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2009252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2009252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"DE-Based Reversible Data Hiding With Improved Overflow Location Map","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470636","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4703233/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DE-Based Reversible Data Hiding With Improved Overflow Location Map","sourcePdf":"19tcsvt01-yhu-2009252.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057139S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4773451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"310","xplore-issue":"4773451","articleId":"4703233","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4703234,"authors":[{"name":"Camel Tanougast","affiliation":["Electronic Architectures Group, Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory of Nancy (LIEN), Nancy University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4773451/4703234/4703234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Camel Tanougast received the Ph.D. degree in microelectronic and electronic instrumentation from Henri Poincar\u00e9 University, Nancy, France, in 2001.","Currently, he is an Associate Professor in electronics at Science and Technology Faculty, Nancy University.

Quality management is therefore a complicated issue and the need to identify the degree of coding degradations in terms of coding and/or transmission errors or system failures is becoming an important criterion for the evaluation of the quality of the MPEG streams. A theoretical decoder (T-STD) defines the verification process based on the proper fill level of an MPEG decoder buffers whose size is defined by the standards in order to obtain an evaluation of the MPEG stream quality. This paper describes a new embedded and programmable solution capable of analysing MPEG streams in real time. The proposed hardware architecture provides a real time continuous buffer analysis of the MPEG stream components and is composed of several modules allowing for simultaneous modeling of the various buffers of the T-STD components (video, audio or system). Real time errors flags are generated when the buffers filling level becomes illegal (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">overflow</i>\n, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">empty</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">buffer</i>\n, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">transfer</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">delay</i>\n, etc.). The architecture has been modeled, validated and simulated using the SystemC and VHDL languages in combination with real MPEG DVB-T streams.

The hardware implementation of this configurable T-STD allows a data rate of 232 Mbps and requires only 9738 logical cells and 4,7 kB memory.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4773451/04703234.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Embedded and Programmable System Based FPGA for Real Time MPEG Stream Buffer Analysis","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2009254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2009254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Embedded and Programmable System Based FPGA for Real Time MPEG Stream Buffer Analysis","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470626","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4703234/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Embedded and Programmable System Based FPGA for Real Time MPEG Stream Buffer Analysis","sourcePdf":"19tcsvt02-ctanougast-2009254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162144S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4773451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4773451","articleId":"4703234","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4703235,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Li","affiliation":["Corporate Technology, Siemens AG, Munich, Germany","Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37406908900"},{"name":"Norbert Oertel","affiliation":["Corporate Technology, Siemens AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Oertel","id":"37660779300"},{"name":"Andreas Hutter","affiliation":["Corporate Technology, Siemens AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Hutter","id":"37273869400"},{"name":"Andr\u00c9 Kaup","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andr\u00c9","lastName":"Kaup","id":"37285096200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4703235","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":120,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1360},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"In today's hybrid video coding, Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) plays a critical role. It aims at minimizing the distortion under a constraint on the rate. Currently, the most popular RDO algorithm for one-pass coding is the one recommended in the H.264/AVC reference software. It, or HR-lambda for convenience, is actually a kind of universal method which performs the optimization only according to the quantization process while ignoring the properties of input sequences. Intuitively, it is not efficient all the time and an adaptive scheme should be better. Therefore, a new algorithm Lap- lambda is presented in this paper. Based on the Laplace distribution of transformed residuals, the proposed Lap-lambda is able to adaptively optimize the input sequences so that the overall coding efficiency is improved. Cases which cannot be well captured by the proposed models are considered via escape methods. Comprehensive simulations verify that compared with HR-lambda , Lap-lambda shows a much better or similar performance in all scenarios. Particularly, significant gains of 1.79 dB and 1.60 dB in PSNR are obtained for slow sequences and B-frames, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4773451/04703235.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2009255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2009255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laplace Distribution Based Lagrangian Rate Distortion Optimization for Hybrid Video Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lagrangian functions","Rate-distortion","Video coding","Automatic voltage control","Multimedia communication","Signal processing","Software algorithms","Optimization methods","Quantization","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","quantisation (signal)","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Laplace distribution based Lagrangian rate distortion optimization","hybrid video coding","H.264/AVC reference software","quantization process","Lap-lambda algorithm","HR-lambda"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid video coding","Lagrange multiplier selection","rate-distortion optimization (RDO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Laplace Distribution Based Lagrangian Rate Distortion Optimization for Hybrid Video Coding","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470635","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laplace Distribution Based Lagrangian Rate Distortion Optimization for Hybrid Video Coding","sourcePdf":"19tcsvt02-xli-2009255.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083117S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","isNumber":"4773451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"120","articleId":"4703235","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4703236,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Motivated by the unique nature of the surface shape of pulmonary fissures in 3-D space, we developed a new automated scheme using computational geometry methods to detect and segment fissures depicted on CT images. After a geometric modeling of the lung volume using the marching cubes algorithm, Laplacian smoothing is applied iteratively to enhance pulmonary fissures by depressing nonfissure structures while smoothing the surfaces of lung fissures. Next, an extended Gaussian image based procedure is used to locate the fissures in a statistical manner that approximates the fissures using a set of plane ldquopatchesrdquo. This approach has several advantages such as independence of anatomic knowledge of the lung structure except the surface shape of fissures, limited sensitivity to other lung structures, and ease of implementation. The scheme performance was evaluated by two experienced thoracic radiologists using a set of 100 images (slices) randomly selected from 10 screening CT examinations. In this preliminary evaluation 98.7% and 94.9% of scheme segmented fissure voxels are within 2 mm of the fissures marked independently by two radiologists in the testing image dataset. Using the scheme detected fissures as reference, 89.4% and 90.1% of manually marked fissure points have distance les2 mm to the reference suggesting a possible under-segmentation of the scheme. The case-based root mean square (rms) distances (ldquoerrorsrdquo) between our scheme and the radiologist ranged from 1.48plusmn0.92 to 2.04plusmn3.88 mm. The discrepancy of fissure detection results between the automated scheme and either radiologist is smaller in this dataset than the interreader variability.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2008.2010441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4897616/04703240.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"719","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.2010441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Computational Geometry Approach to Automated Pulmonary Fissure Segmentation in CT Examinations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Computational Geometry Approach to Automated Pulmonary Fissure Segmentation in CT Examinations","volume":"28","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4703240/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601721","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","pubMedId":"19272987","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Computational Geometry Approach to Automated Pulmonary Fissure Segmentation in CT Examinations","sourcePdf":"tmi-jpu-2010441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09458S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4897616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4897616","articleId":"4703240","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4703242,"authors":[{"name":"IlHong Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea","Broadcasting Media Group, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4773451/4703242/4703242-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["IlHong Shin received the B.S, M.S, and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2000, 2002, and 2007, respectively.","He is currently working at the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea.

A new two-fold up-sampling method is proposed for SVC. The proposed up-sampling method is based on a combination of the forward and backward type-II discrete cosine transform (DCT). As the proposed up-sampling kernel has various symmetries for efficient computation, a fast algorithm of type-II DCT-based up-sampling method is also proposed. For further improvement of the up-sampling performance, an adaptive filtering method in the type-II DCT up-sampling is introduced, which applies different weighting parameters to DCT coefficients. Even as this adaptive method is applied, the up-sampling operation in the decoder has the same computational complexity as the fixed weighting method.

By constructing a new fuzzy Lyapunov function and by making use of novel techniques, an improved delay-dependent stability condition is obtained, which is dependent on the lower and upper delay bounds. The merit of the proposed stability condition lies in its reduced conservatism, which is achieved by avoiding the utilization of some bounding inequalities for the cross products between two vectors. Then, a delay-dependent stabilization approach based on a parallel distributed compensation scheme is developed for both state feedback and observer-based output feedback cases. The proposed stability and stabilization conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved efficiently by using existing optimization techniques. Two illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results proposed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2003449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4802395/04703279.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2003449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802395","startPage":"306","endPage":"317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Analysis and Stabilization for Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems With Time-Varying Delay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability Analysis and Stabilization for Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems With Time-Varying Delay","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703279/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"39","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10518705","pubMedId":"19273004","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4703279/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Analysis and Stabilization for Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems With Time-Varying Delay","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-gao-2003449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116094S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4802395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"4802395","articleId":"4703279","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4703280,"authors":[{"name":"Jeich Mar","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jeich","lastName":"Mar","id":"37325213100"},{"name":"You-Rong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"You-Rong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37405331000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4703280","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":872},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Synthetic aperture radar","Receiving antennas","Direction of arrival estimation","Phased arrays","Array signal processing","Satellite antennas","Signal resolution","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware reconfiguration feature","software-defined radio digital beamformer","SDR digital beamformer","microsatellite SAR system","synthetic aperture radar systems","direction-of-arrival estimation","null-steering operation modes","field-programmable gate array processor","FPGA processor","multiple beam","common module","mode switching","cross-range pulse repetition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital beamformer (DBF)","microsatellite","software-defined radio (SDR)","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]},{"kwd":["Digital beamformer (DBF)","microsatellite","software-defined radio (SDR)","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703280","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.2008315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","abstract":"The hardware reconfiguration feature of a software-defined radio (SDR) architecture can support multiple modes of a digital beamformer (DBF) striving for compactness and efficient processing power, which are important issues for microsatellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems.

The ANN was trained with activation data obtained from simulations using a musculoskeletal model of the arm that was modified to reflect C5 SCI and FES capabilities. Several arm movements were recorded from able-bodied subjects and these kinematics served as the inputs to inverse dynamic simulations that predicted muscle activation patterns corresponding to the movements recorded. A system identification procedure was used to identify an optimal reduced set of voluntary input muscles from the larger set that are typically under voluntary control in C5 SCI. These voluntary activations were used as the inputs to the ANN and muscles that are typically paralyzed in C5 SCI were the outputs to be predicted. The neural network controller was able to predict the needed FES paralyzed muscle activations from ldquovoluntaryrdquo activations with less than a 3.6% RMS prediction error.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2010480","startPage":"80","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2010480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4782182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4782182/04703287.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility of EMG-Based Neural Network Controller for an Upper Extremity Neuroprosthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703287/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Feasibility of EMG-Based Neural Network Controller for an Upper Extremity Neuroprosthesis","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4703287/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10473095","pubMedId":"19211327","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility of EMG-Based Neural Network Controller for an Upper Extremity Neuroprosthesis","sourcePdf":"17tnsre01-jhincapie-2010480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10502S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4782182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4782182","articleId":"4703287","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4703289,"authors":[{"name":"Wuhua Li","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4712525/4703289/4703289-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wuhua Li received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degree in applied power electronics and electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002 and 2008, respectively.","From September 2004 to March 2005, he was an Intern, and from January 2007 to June 2008, a Research Assistant in GE Global Research Center, Shanghai, China.

A family of isolated interleaved boost or buck DC/DC converters with WCCIs is summarized by employing the four main types of interleaved structures, which is suitable for step-up or step-down isolated distribution power systems. Then, an interleaved flyback-boost converter with WCCIs and an active clamp circuit is analyzed as an example to explore the advantages of the derived converters. The active clamp scheme is adopted to recycle the leakage energy and to suppress the turn-off voltage spikes on MOSFETs. And only one set of active clamp circuit is necessary for the interleaved two phases. Zero voltage transition (ZVT) soft switching performances are achieved for all MOSFETs during the whole switching transition. Furthermore, the output diode turn-off current falling rate is controlled by the inherent leakage inductance of the WCCIs, and the output diode reverse-recovery problem is alleviated. A clear picture is made in this paper of the general law and structure of the isolated interleaved dc/dc converters with WCCIs.

This paper proposes a novel concept wherein dual virtual quadrature sources are used to synthesize the required additional voltage. This is seen to result in simple low-cost ac converters that are robust, have minimal component count, and can realize phase shift and/or harmonic control without requiring multiple sources or energy-storage elements.

In this paper, we propose a new matrix formulation of the imaging equation in the cases of non-co-planar arrays and polarimetric measurements. Then, we improve our parametric imaging techniques in terms of resolution and estimation accuracy. This is done by enhancing both the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) parametric imaging, introducing alternative dirty images, and by introducing better power estimates based on least squares, with positive semi-definite constraints. We also discuss the use of robust Capon beamforming and semi-definite programming for solving the self-calibration problem. Additionally, we provide statistical analysis of the bias of the MVDR beamformer for the case of moving array, which serves as a first step in analyzing iterative approaches such as CLEAN and the techniques proposed in this paper. Finally we demonstrate a full deconvolution process based on the parametric imaging techniques and show its improved resolution and sensitivity compared to the CLEAN method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","volume":"2","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"10359864","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4703497/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Parametric High Resolution Techniques for Radio Astronomical Imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric High Resolution Techniques for Radio Astronomical Imaging","sourcePdf":"jstsp-leshem-2005318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104498S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4703300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4703300","articleId":"4703497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4703508,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00c9r\u00d4me Bobin","affiliation":["Laboratoire AIM, CEA/DSM-CNRS-Universit\u00e8 Paris Diderot, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4703300/4703508/4703508-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bobin graduated from the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) de Cachan, France, in 2005 and received the M.Sc. degree in signal and image processing from ENS Cachan and Universit\u00e9 Paris XI, Orsay, France.

A new field of interest based on sparsity has recently emerged: \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">compressed</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sensing</i>\n. This theory is a new sampling framework that provides an alternative to the well-known Shannon sampling theory.

We first give a brief overview of the compressed sensing theory which provides very simple coding process with low computational cost, thus favoring its use for real-time applications often found onboard space mission. In practical situations, owing to particular observation strategies (for instance, raster scans) astronomical data are often redundant; in that context, we point out that a CS-based compression scheme is flexible enough to account for particular observational strategies. Indeed, we show also that CS provides a new fantastic way to handle multiple observations of the same field view, allowing us to recover low level details, which is impossible with standard compression methods. This kind of CS data fusion concept could lead to an elegant and effective way to solve the problem ESA is faced with, for the transmission to the earth of the data collected by PACS, one of the instruments onboard the Herschel spacecraft which will launched in late 2008/early 2009. We show that CS enables to recover data with a spatial resolution enhanced up to 30% with similar sensitivity compared to the averaging technique proposed by ESA.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2005337","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4703300/04703508.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2005337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4703300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing in Astronomy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703508/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing in Astronomy","volume":"2","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10359869","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4703508/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing in Astronomy","sourcePdf":"jstsp-bobin-2005337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099929S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4703300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"4703300","articleId":"4703508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4703511,"authors":[{"name":"Tim J.

However, designers have no results on the frequency performance achievable that allow to consciously choose the best approach to meet the prescribed specifications efficiently. In this paper, a comparison among the possible Miller approaches is carried out by exploiting an analytical figure of merit that expresses a tradeoff between gain-bandwidth product, load capacitance, and total transconductance for a given value of phase margin. Interesting and useful results, even unexpected, are found. The accuracy of the comparison is also validated through simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","CMOS technology","Transconductance","Operational amplifiers","Topology","Resistors","Voltage","Capacitance","Capacitors","MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active networks","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","feedback amplifiers","frequency control","integrated circuit design","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency compensation technique","CMOS two-stage Miller OTA","two-stage transconductance operational amplifier","Miller approach","nulling resistor","voltage buffer","current buffer","current amplifier","phase margin","analog integrated circuits","multistage amplifier","feedback amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog integrated circuits","frequency compensation","feedback amplifier","CMOS","multistage amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.2003362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4703515/04703521.pdf","startPage":"1099","endPage":"1103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4703515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.2003362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of the Frequency Compensation Techniques for CMOS Two-Stage Miller OTAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of the Frequency Compensation Techniques for CMOS Two-Stage Miller OTAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703521/","volume":"55","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4703521/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10360128","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of the Frequency Compensation Techniques for CMOS Two-Stage Miller OTAs","sourcePdf":"55tcsii11-gpalumbo-2003362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081756S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4703515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4703515","articleId":"4703521","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4703523,"authors":[{"name":"H\u00c5kan Johansson","affiliation":["Division of Electronics Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"H\u00c5kan","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37274443200"},{"name":"Per Lowenborg","affiliation":["Division of Electronics Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Per","lastName":"Lowenborg","id":"37274439900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4703523","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":574},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Frequency response","Analog-digital conversion","Frequency estimation","Frequency conversion","Calibration","Costs","Matrix converters","Interleaved codes","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","compensation","frequency response","least squares approximations","matrix inversion","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least-squares filter","compensation","frequency response mismatch error","time-interleaved A/D converter","impulse response","matrix inversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compensation filters","frequency response mismatch errors","least-squares design","time-interleaved analog-to-digital converters"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a least-squares filter design technique for the compensation of frequency response mismatch errors in M-channel time-interleaved analog-to-digital converters.

Recent anatomic and physiological studies and technological developments in very large-scale integration technology have encouraged the engineers to brace up with this new paradigm. In this paper, a simple network model that is essential in order to explore spatiotemporal behavior and to develop new algorithms based on wave computing technique has been presented. The presented network is a 2-D reaction-diffusion cellular neural network consisting of relaxation oscillators. The network can be programmed as an autowave generator and sources of the wave can be placed at any place on the network. The network has the simplest model that exhibits autowaves. Furthermore, the model is suitable for the implementation of a larger network. The propagation of autowaves between the cells whose dynamics is fixed shows that the network can be adapted to already developed wave computing algorithms in literature. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.2002569","startPage":"1173","endPage":"1177","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4703515/04703532.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.2002569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4703515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Programmable Autowave Generator Network for Wave Computing Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer applications","Computer networks","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Cellular neural networks","Biology computing","Retina","Computer aided instruction","Image processing","Information processing","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","neural chips","optical information processing","programmable circuits","signal generators","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable autowave generator network","wave computing applications","spatiotemporal-wave-based computing","active medium","wave computing paradigm","biological systems","physiological study","very large-scale integration technology","2D reaction diffusion cellular neural network","relaxation oscillator","wave computing algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular neural networks (CNNs)","cellular wave computer","relaxation oscillators","spatiotemporal waves","wave computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Programmable Autowave Generator Network for Wave Computing Applications","volume":"55","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4703532/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10360139","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Programmable Autowave Generator Network for Wave Computing Applications","sourcePdf":"55tcsii11-yalcin-2002569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056948S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4703515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4703515","articleId":"4703532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4703534,"authors":[{"name":"Tso-Bing Juang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Pingtung Institute of Commerce, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tso-Bing","lastName":"Juang","id":"37274341900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4703534","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":439},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703534","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Concurrent computing","CMOS technology","Signal processing algorithms","Digital signal processing","Matrix decomposition","Large scale integration","Very large scale integration","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital arithmetic","signal processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low latency angle recoding method","higher bit-width parallel CORDIC rotator","coordinate rotation digital computer","para-CORDIC rotator","computational bottleneck","area-delay reduction","CMOS technology","very large-scale integration design","size 0.13 mum","frequency 250 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC)","signal processing","very large-scale integration (VLSI) design"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a low latency angle recoding method for the higher bit-width parallel coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) rotator implementations is proposed. In previous studies, parallel CORDIC (para-CORDIC) rotators have been used to reduce the computational bottleneck by precomputing the required rotation directions. However, the number of required microrotations increases with the bit-width of the input angle, leading to extra stages compared to the conventional CORDIC. To overcome this, our proposed method can obtain a reduced number of microrotations for larger bit-width implementations by recoding two bits of the input angle in the first few area-consuming stages concurrently. This leads to above 21% area/delay reduction compared to previously reported 64-bit para-CORDIC methods. We have implemented our proposed 64-bit para-CORDIC rotator implementations using 0.13- mum CMOS technology, and the operating speed can achieve 250 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.2002566","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4703515/04703534.pdf","startPage":"1139","endPage":"1143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.2002566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4703515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Latency Angle Recoding Methods for the Higher Bit-Width Parallel CORDIC Rotator Implementations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Low Latency Angle Recoding Methods for the Higher Bit-Width Parallel CORDIC Rotator Implementations","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4703534/","accessionNumber":"10360142","volume":"55","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Latency Angle Recoding Methods for the Higher Bit-Width Parallel CORDIC Rotator Implementations","sourcePdf":"55tcsii11-juang-2002566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072814S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4703515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4703515","articleId":"4703534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4703535,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automation, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085665112"},{"name":"Lei Guo","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automation, South-East University, Nanjing, China","School of Instrument Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37083736400"},{"name":"Chong Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Complexity Science, College of Automation Engineering, Qingdao University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404176900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4703535","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability criteria","Neural networks","Symmetric matrices","Linear matrix inequalities","Delay effects","Automation","Neurons","Maintenance engineering","Artificial neural networks","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear matrix inequalities","neural nets","stability criteria","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","time-varying delay","delay dependent stability criteria","integral inequality","linear matrix inequalities","stability conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","delay-dependent","neural networks (NNs)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4703535","abstract":"In this letter, simplified delay-dependent stability criteria for neural networks are derived by using a simple integral inequality.

An archive is used to store all the solutions that have been explored before. Different from other memory schemes in the literature, a novel binary space partitioning tree archive design is advocated. Not only is the design an efficient method to check for revisits, if any, it in itself constitutes a novel adaptive mutation operator that has no parameter. To demonstrate the power of the method, the algorithm is evaluated using 19 famous benchmark functions. The results are as follows. (1) Though it only uses finite resolution grids, when compared with a canonical genetic algorithm, a generic real-coded genetic algorithm, a canonical genetic algorithm with simple diversity mechanism, and three particle swarm optimization algorithms, it shows a significant improvement. (2) The new algorithm also shows superior performance compared to covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), a state-of-the-art method for adaptive mutation. (3) It can work with problems that have large search spaces with dimensions as high as 40. (4) The corresponding CPU overhead of the binary space partitioning tree design is insignificant for applications with expensive or time-consuming fitness evaluations, and for such applications, the memory usage due to the archive is acceptable. (5) Though the adaptive mutation is parameter-less, it shows and maintains a stable good performance. However, for other algorithms we compare, the performance is highly dependent on suitable parameter settings.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2008.2003008","startPage":"454","endPage":"472","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/4808349/04703546.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2008.2003008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm That Adaptively Mutates and Never Revisits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Genetic mutations","Partitioning algorithms","Stochastic processes","Design methodology","Particle swarm optimization","Covariance matrix","Convergence","Annealing","Terminology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","evolutionary computation","genetic algorithms","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive mutation operator","benchmark functions","finite resolution grids","canonical genetic algorithm","generic real-coded genetic algorithm","diversity mechanism","particle swarm optimization algorithms","covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy","adaptive mutation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive mutation","binary space partitioning","diversity maintenance","genetic algorithm","no revisits","premature convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4703546/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm That Adaptively Mutates and Never Revisits","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4703546/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10547376","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm That Adaptively Mutates and Never Revisits","sourcePdf":"tevc00-syuen-2003008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.219054S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4808349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"4808349","articleId":"4703546","onlineDate":"09 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":4705793,"authors":[{"name":"Brian D.

Unique challenges associated with PAF observations, including extremely low signal levels, long-term system gain stability requirements, spatially correlated noise due to mutual coupling, and tight beamshape tolerances, require the development of new array signal processing techniques for this application. We propose a calibration and beamforming strategy for PAFs including interference mitigation with power spectral density (PSD) estimation bias correction. Key efficiency metrics for single-feed instruments are extended to the array case and used to verify performance of the algorithms. These techniques are validated using numerical simulations and experimental data from a 19-element PAF on the Green Bank 20-m telescope.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2005023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4703300/04705793.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2005023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4703300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Processing for Phased Array Feeds in Radio Astronomical Telescopes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4705793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4705793/","displayDocTitle":"Signal Processing for Phased Array Feeds in Radio Astronomical Telescopes","volume":"2","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10359876","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4705793/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Processing for Phased Array Feeds in Radio Astronomical Telescopes","sourcePdf":"02jstsp05-bjeffs-2005023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101251S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4703300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4703300","articleId":"4705793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4708720,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Hoon Chun","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jung-Hoon Chun","id":"37272877300"},{"name":"Haechang Lee","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Haechang Lee","id":"37292576500"},{"name":"Jie Shen","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jie Shen","id":"37558596100"},{"name":"TJ Chin","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"firstName":"TJ","lastName":"Chin","id":"37664911900"},{"name":"Ting Wu","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ting Wu","id":"37290006000"},{"name":"Xudong Shi","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Xudong Shi","id":"37652823100"},{"name":"Kambiz Kaviani","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kambiz","lastName":"Kaviani","id":"37649331200"},{"name":"Wendemagegnehu Beyene","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wendemagegnehu","lastName":"Beyene","id":"37284655700"},{"name":"Brian Leibowitz","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Leibowitz","id":"37282432100"},{"name":"Rich Perego","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rich","lastName":"Perego","id":"37642301000"},{"name":"Ken Chang","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ken Chang","id":"37538092100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2604-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2605-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4708720","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":511},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4708720","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Timing","Circuits","CMOS process","Calibration","Read-write memory","Control systems","System performance","Cost function","Finite impulse response filter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","equalisers","error statistics","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS transceiver","memory interface","memory read-write controller","TX FIR equalizer","continuous time RX equalizer","active inductor loads","diagnostic circuit","programmable DC differential voltage offset","BER","bit error rate","bit rate 16 Gbit/s","size 65 nm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2008.4708720","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695901/4708707/04708720.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2008.4708720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 16Gb/s 65nm CMOS transceiver for a memory interface","abstract":"A transceiver for a memory controller operating at 16 Gb/s per link is implemented in 65 nm CMOS process.

FP4 contains 16 times 16 physical logic elements (LE) and 16 context memory planes, thus virtually 4,096 LEs are available in total. The core size is only 1.36 mm times 1.15 mm in 90 nm CMOS technology. A critical issue of FP4 is to prevent the fall of multi-context execution speed. Therefore we have developed a shift-register-type temporal communication module (SR-TCM) and a design automation software named PELOC. PELOC can divide a circuit larger than the physical capacity of FP4 to several smaller sub-circuits while maintaining critical path delay equal among all the sub-circuits. By using the SR-TCM and PELOC, we confirmed that the execution speed of FP4 is almost constant regardless of the number of contexts used.","doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2008.4708736","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695901/4708707/04708736.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2008.4708736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.6mm<sup>2</sup> 4,096 logic elements multi-context FPGA core in 90nm CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4708736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4708736/","displayDocTitle":"A 1.6mm<sup>2</sup> 4,096 logic elements multi-context FPGA core in 90nm CMOS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423582","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4708736/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.6mm<sup>2</sup> 4,096 logic elements multi-context FPGA core in 90nm CMOS","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12072008-00029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049264S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695901","isNumber":"4708707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695901","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4708707","articleId":"4708736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4708744,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

However, inevitable supply voltage reduction causes signal voltage mismatch between a non-scaled analog chip and a scaled A-D mixed chip. To solve the problem, we present a Delta-Amplifier (DeltAMP) which can handle larger signal amplitude than the supply voltage. DeltaAMP operates by folding an analog signal within a voltage window using a virtual ground amplifier, modulation switches and comparators. The folded delta signal has to be reconstructed to the ordinal signal. A reconstruction circuit is also proposed based on Analog-Time-Digital conversion (ATD) in which-pulse width analog information obtained at the comparators in DeltAMP, is converted to a digital signal by counting. A test chip of DeltAMP with ATD using a 90 nm CMOS technology, achieved input voltage range of 2.0 Vpp at a 0.5 V supply, and SNR of 62 dB at signal bandwidth of 120 kHz.

Furthermore the proposed comparator requires only one phase clock while conventionally two phase clocks were required leading to relaxed clock. Moreover, a low input noise of 0.6 mV at 1 sigma, three times lower than the conventional one, is obtained. Prototype comparators are realized in 90 nm 10M1P CMOS technology.

Experimental array design consisting of 1023 low threshold voltage devices demonstrated accurate measurement of subthreshold leakage current with precision of 10-pA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs","Leakage current","Current measurement","Switches","Subthreshold current","Semiconductor device measurement","Threshold voltage","Energy consumption","Circuit testing","Integrated circuit measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current measurement","leakage currents","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOS transistor array","pico-ampere order precision","leakage current variation","sub-threshold current measurement","off-state current variation characterization","masking current effect","potential equalizing supply","low threshold voltage devices","current 10 pA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2008.4708809","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695901/4708707/04708809.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2008.4708809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MOS transistor array with pico-ampere order precision for accurate characterization of leakage current variation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4708809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A MOS transistor array with pico-ampere order precision for accurate characterization of leakage current variation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4708809/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4708809/","accessionNumber":"10423655","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MOS transistor array with pico-ampere order precision for accurate characterization of leakage current variation","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12072008-00102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047259S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695901","isNumber":"4708707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695901","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4708707","articleId":"4708809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4708812,"authors":[{"name":"Pratap Kumar Das","affiliation":["ECE Department, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Pratap Kumar","lastName":"Das","id":"37089131043"},{"name":"Bharadwaj Amrutur","affiliation":["ECE Department, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Bharadwaj","lastName":"Amrutur","id":"37370284100"},{"name":"J.

Measurements show that in the 50-860 MHz frequency range, the VGLNA achieves 15 dB maximum gain, 31 dB variable gain range, a minimum 3.8 dB noise figure and 2.6 dBm 11P3 at 15 dB gain while consumes 5.7 mA from a 1.8 V supply.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695901/4708707/04708826.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"460","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2008.4708826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2008.4708826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4708826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wideband CMOS variable gain low noise amplifier based on single-to-differential stage for TV tuner applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Broadband amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers","TV","Tuners","Circuit noise","Impedance matching","Attenuators","Attenuation","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attenuators","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","television applications","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband CMOS variable gain low noise amplifier","TV tuner applications","single-to-differential stage","off-chip balun","noise factor","frequency 50 MHz to 860 MHz","gain 15 dB","noise figure 3.8 dB","current 5.7 mA","voltage 1.8 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LNA","S2D","Attenuator","Wideband","Tuner","Balun"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4708826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A wideband CMOS variable gain low noise amplifier based on single-to-differential stage for TV tuner applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4708826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423672","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wideband CMOS variable gain low noise amplifier based on single-to-differential stage for TV tuner applications","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12072008-00119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060751S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695901","isNumber":"4708707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695901","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4708707","articleId":"4708826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4708866,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Li","id":"37403672800"},{"name":"Jinpeng Huai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinpeng","lastName":"Huai","id":"37284361400"},{"name":"Jianxin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Li","id":"37405686200"},{"name":"Tianyu Wo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tianyu","lastName":"Wo","id":"37410208900"},{"name":"Minxiong Wen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Minxiong","lastName":"Wen","id":"37662379700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3482-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2059"}],"articleNumber":"4708866","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":612},"abstract":"Live migration provides transparent load-balancing and fault-tolerant mechanism for applications. When a Virtual Machine migrates among hosts residing in two networks, the network attachment point of the Virtual Machine is also changed, thus the Virtual Machine will suffer from IP mobility problem after migration. This paper proposes an approach called Hypervisor controlled Mobile IP to support live migration of Virtual Machine across networks, which enables virtual machine live migration over distributed computing resources. Since Hypervisor is capable of predicting exact time and destination host of Virtual Machine migration, our approach not only can improve migration performance but also reduce the network restoration latency. Some comprehensive experiments have been conducted and the results show that the HyperMIP brings negligible overhead to network performance of Virtual Machines. The network restoration time of HyperMIP supported migration is about only 3 second. HyperMIP is a promising essential component to provide reliability and fault tolerant for network application running in Virtual Machine.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE High Assurance Systems Engineering Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4708846/4708847/04708866.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"88","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE High Assurance Systems Engineering Symposium","doi":"10.1109/HASE.2008.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HASE.2008.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4708866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HyperMIP: Hypervisor Controlled Mobile IP for Virtual Machine Live Migration across Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual machine monitors","Virtual machining","Virtual manufacturing","Control systems","Hardware","Roaming","Network topology","Mobile computing","Application software","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","fault tolerance","IP networks","mobile radio","resource allocation","telecommunication network reliability","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hypervisor controlled mobile IP","virtual machine live migration","transparent load-balancing","fault-tolerant mechanism","distributed computing resource","network restoration latency reduction","network reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hypervisor","Virtual Machine","Live Migration","Mobile IP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4708866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"HyperMIP: Hypervisor Controlled Mobile IP for Virtual Machine Live Migration across Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4708866/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423687","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HyperMIP: Hypervisor Controlled Mobile IP for Virtual Machine Live Migration across Networks","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"3482a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062683S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4708846","isNumber":"4708847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4708846","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4708847","articleId":"4708866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4708870,"authors":[{"name":"Susmit Jha","affiliation":["EECS, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Susmit","lastName":"Jha","id":"37655618700"},{"name":"Sumit Kumar Jha","affiliation":["CMU, School of Computer Science"],"firstName":"Sumit Kumar","lastName":"Jha","id":"37857266900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3482-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2059"}],"articleNumber":"4708870","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":551},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Pulp manufacturing","Fabrication","Payloads","Computer crashes","Vehicle crash testing","Runtime","Fingerprint recognition","Algorithm design and analysis","Combinational circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational circuits","integrated circuit testing","microprocessor chips","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["randomization based probabilistic approach","trojan circuits","manufactured chip","catastrophic crash","functional testing","hypothesis testing","fingerprint input pattern","combinational circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Trojan Circuits","Randomized Algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4708870","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a randomization based technique to verify whether a manufactured chip conforms to its design or is infected by any trojan circuit. A trojan circuit can be inserted into the design or fabrication mask by a malicious manufacturer such that it monitors for a specific rare trigger condition, and then it produces a payload error in the circuit which alters the functionality of the circuit often causing a catastrophic crash of the system where the chip was being used. Since trojans are activated by rare input patterns, they are stealthy by nature and are difficult to detect through conventional techniques of functional testing. In this paper, we propose a novel randomized approach to probabilistically compare the functionality of the implemented circuit with the design of the circuit. Using hypothesis testing, we provide quantitative guarantees when our algorithm reports that there is no trojan in the implemented circuit. This allows us to trade runtime for accuracy. The technique is sound, that is, it reports presence of a trojan only if the implemented circuit is actually infected. If our algorithm finds that the implemented circuit is infected with a trojan, it also reports a fingerprint input pattern to distinguish the implemented circuit from the design. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique on a set of infected and benign combinational circuits.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708847","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE High Assurance Systems Engineering Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE High Assurance Systems Engineering Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4708846/4708847/04708870.pdf","doi":"10.1109/HASE.2008.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HASE.2008.37","startPage":"117","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomization Based Probabilistic Approach to Detect Trojan Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4708870/","displayDocTitle":"Randomization Based Probabilistic Approach to Detect Trojan Circuits","htmlLink":"/document/4708870/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10423691","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomization Based Probabilistic Approach to Detect Trojan Circuits","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"3482a117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088005S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4708846","isNumber":"4708847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4708846","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4708847","articleId":"4708870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4708953,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Wu","id":"37675371200"},{"name":"Ling Chen","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Novel Software Tech, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China","Department of Computer Science, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280379600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3398-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4708953","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":406},"abstract":"An algorithm for mining frequent subgraphs in large database of labeled graphs is proposed.

IBSD sequentially analyzes the incoming symptoms in an event-driven way and incrementally computes the Bayesian suspected degree and determines the most probable fault set for the current observed symptoms. Simulation results show that the algorithm has high fault detection rate as well as low false positive rate and has a good performance even in the presence of unobserved alarms. The algorithm which has a polynomial computational complexity can be applied to large scale communication network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICYCS.2008.386","doi":"10.1109/ICYCS.2008.386","startPage":"653","endPage":"658","pdfPath":"/iel5/4708920/4708921/04709050.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","publicationTitle":"2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4709050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4709050/","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Event-Driven Heuristic Fault Localization using Incremental Bayesian Suspected Degree","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10423846","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4709050/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Event-Driven Heuristic Fault Localization using Incremental Bayesian Suspected Degree","confLoc":"Hunan, China","sourcePdf":"3398a653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059725S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4708920","isNumber":"4708921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4708920","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4708921","articleId":"4709050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4709108,"authors":[{"name":"Shuxue Zou","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Symbol Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Shuxue","lastName":"Zou","id":"37651560700"},{"name":"Yanxin Huang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Symbol Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Yanxin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37655257900"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Symbol Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407582200"},{"name":"Jianxin Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087470264"},{"name":"Chunguang Zhou","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Symbol Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Chunguang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37276315400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3398-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4709108","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"abstract":"The performance of support vector machines (SVM) drops significantly while facing imbalanced datasets, though it has been extensively studied and has shown remarkable success in many applications. Some researchers have pointed out that it is difficult to avoid such decrease when trying to improve the efficient of SVM on imbalanced datasets by modifying the algorithm itself only. Therefore, as the pretreatment of data, sampling is a popular strategy to handle the class imbalance problem since it re-balances the dataset directly. In this paper, we proposed a novel sampling method based on genetic algorithms (GA) to rebalance the imbalanced training dataset for SVM. In order to evaluating the final classifiers more impartiality, AUC (area under ROC curve) is employed as the fitness function in GA. The experimental results show that the sampling strategy based on GA outperforms the random sampling method. And our method is prior to individual SVM for imbalanced protein domain boundary prediction. The accuracy of the prediction is about 70% with the AUC value 0.905.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Sampling methods","Support vector machine classification","Accuracy","Genetic algorithms","Machine learning","Data processing","Kernel","Protein engineering","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","proteins","sampling methods","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SVM learning","imbalanced data","protein domain prediction","support vector machine","sampling method","genetic algorithm","fitness function","pattern classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SVM","Imbalanced data","GA","Sampling","Protein domain prediction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICYCS.2008.72","publicationTitle":"2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","pdfPath":"/iel5/4708920/4708921/04709108.pdf","startPage":"982","endPage":"987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICYCS.2008.72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SVM Learning from Imbalanced Data by GA Sampling for Protein Domain Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4709108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SVM Learning from Imbalanced Data by GA Sampling for Protein Domain Prediction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4709108/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4709108/","accessionNumber":"10423904","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SVM Learning from Imbalanced Data by GA Sampling for Protein Domain Prediction","confLoc":"Hunan, China","sourcePdf":"3398a982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056258S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4708920","isNumber":"4708921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4708920","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4708921","articleId":"4709108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4709142,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Ming","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Ming","id":"37591055000"},{"name":"Xingan Jiang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xingan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37654236400"},{"name":"Jiancong Bai","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jiancong","lastName":"Bai","id":"37650914600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3398-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4709142","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software testing","System testing","Embedded software","Application software","Optimization methods","Software algorithms","Linear programming","Computational modeling","Computer aided instruction","Genetic mutations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","embedded systems","genetic algorithms","integer programming","program testing","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test instruction generation","software defect finding","optimized partheno-genetic algorithm","embedded chipset system","integer programming model","instruction-set test case generation","error detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Partheno-Genetic algorithm","test case","test instruction generation","multidimensional knapsack problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4709142","abstract":"Test case generation is the classic method in finding software defects, and test instruction generation is one of its typical applications in embedded chipset systems.In this paper, the optimized partheno-genetic algorithm(PGA) is proposed after a 0-1 integer programming model is set up for instruction-set test cases generation problem.

The presented GPSES approach is effectively applied to solve the examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. Experiment results show the efficiency of our methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICYCS.2008.187","startPage":"1749","endPage":"1754","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","pdfPath":"/iel5/4708920/4708921/04709238.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICYCS.2008.187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tuning of the Structure and Parameters of a Neural Network Using a Good Points Set Evolutionary Strategy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Global Positioning System","Feedforward neural networks","Costs","Switches","Evolutionary computation","MIMO","Computer networks","Information science","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","number theory","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural network parameter tuning","good points set evolutionary algorithm","number theory","optimization problem","crossover operator","neural network learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolutionary strategy","neural networks","Good Points Set method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4709238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Tuning of the Structure and Parameters of a Neural Network Using a Good Points Set Evolutionary Strategy","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4709238/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10424034","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning of the Structure and Parameters of a Neural Network Using a Good Points Set Evolutionary Strategy","confLoc":"Hunan, China","sourcePdf":"3398b749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051747S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4708920","isNumber":"4708921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4708920","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4708921","articleId":"4709238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4709248,"authors":[{"name":"Yemei Qin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"],"firstName":"Yemei","lastName":"Qin","id":"37086790607"},{"name":"Ji Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086650552"},{"name":"Weihua Gui","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Gui","id":"37273636200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3398-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4709248","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Switches","Genetic mutations","Biological cells","Particle swarm optimization","Blindness","Computer networks","Distributed computing","Information science","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","convergence","distribution networks","genetic algorithms","mathematical operators","particle swarm optimisation","probability","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle clonal genetic algorithm","sequence coding","distribution network reconfiguration","binary coding","mutation probability","convergence","particle swarm optimisation algorithm","mutation operator","global optimal solution","search problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sequence coding","distribution network reconfiguration","infeasible solution","PCGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4709248","abstract":"To handle massive binary-coding infeasible solutions in distribution network reconfiguration, a sequence coding is presented.

This algorithm utilizes the concept of intrusion-aware reliability that helps to provide adequate reliability at the modest communication cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","pdfPath":"/iel5/4708920/4708921/04709287.pdf","startPage":"2038","endPage":"2043","publicationTitle":"2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","doi":"10.1109/ICYCS.2008.489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICYCS.2008.489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708921","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4709287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trusting Anomaly and Intrusion Claims for Cooperative Distributed Intrusion Detection Schemes of Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Wireless sensor networks","Telecommunication network reliability","Distributed computing","Costs","Nonhomogeneous media","Computer networks","Fault tolerance","Algorithm design and analysis","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","trusting anomaly detection","cooperative distributed intrusion detection scheme","unidentified malicious node","faulty anomaly","intrusion-aware reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Intrusion detection","Wireless Sensor Networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4709287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Trusting Anomaly and Intrusion Claims for Cooperative Distributed Intrusion Detection Schemes of Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4709287/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10424082","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trusting Anomaly and Intrusion Claims for Cooperative Distributed Intrusion Detection Schemes of Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Hunan, China","sourcePdf":"3398c038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087617S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4708920","isNumber":"4708921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4708920","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4708921","articleId":"4709287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4709407,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Zeng","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37650430300"},{"name":"Echuan Yan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Echuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37604181600"},{"name":"Chunfeng Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chunfeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37654828100"},{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","id":"37656173400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3398-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4709407","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4709407","abstract":"Landslide is a kind of genetic type of slope and has the same characteristics with slope. The major external motivation factor of landslide displacement is groundwater and it is under the control of remedial measures at the same time after its remediation. Chaotic time series of landslide displacement and its influential factors could reflect the history of landslide displacement of dynamic system, the displacement could be predicted by reconstructing landslide displacement of dynamic system according to the observation of multivariate time series and adopting RBF neural network to reflect relationship between variables. Comparative analysis of the results from the forecast show that: multivariable time series model can predict landslide displacement effectively, and the forecast accuracy is higher than the accuracy of a single variable time series model; multivariable time series model is of clearer sense of the physical mechanics and reflects the real evolution of deformation characteristics more effective.","doi":"10.1109/ICYCS.2008.163","startPage":"2707","endPage":"2712","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","pdfPath":"/iel5/4708920/4708921/04709407.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICYCS.2008.163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4708921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Multivariable Time Series Based on RBF Neural Network in Prediction of Landslide Displacement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Terrain factors","Deformable models","Predictive models","Genetics","Displacement control","Displacement measurement","Time measurement","Chaos","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erosion","geology","geophysics computing","groundwater","radial basis function networks","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariable chaotic time series model","RBF neural network","landslide displacement prediction","groundwater factor","remedial measure","dynamic system","physical mechanics","deformation characteristic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Prediction of landslide displacement","chaos","Phase space reconstruction","multivariate time series","RBF neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4709407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of Multivariable Time Series Based on RBF Neural Network in Prediction of Landslide Displacement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4709407/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10424202","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Multivariable Time Series Based on RBF Neural Network in Prediction of Landslide Displacement","confLoc":"Hunan, China","sourcePdf":"3398c707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059038S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4708920","isNumber":"4708921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4708920","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4708921","articleId":"4709407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4709446,"authors":[{"name":"Xulei Bao","affiliation":["School of Electronics Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xulei","lastName":"Bao","id":"37651078900"},{"name":"Guangyi Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guangyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37655290000"},{"name":"Cuiping Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Cuiping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37656290700"},{"name":"Wei Feng","affiliation":["School of Electronics Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Feng","id":"37656298200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3398-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4709446","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Investigation on Impulsive Synchronization of Chaotic PN Sequences Based on FPGA","abstract":"This paper studies impulsive synchronization of digital chaotic PN (Psudo-noise) sequences.
