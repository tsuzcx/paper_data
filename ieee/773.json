The coefficients in the GSW algorithm corresponding to a series of overlapping ranging of the mean emissivity, the atmospheric water vapor content, and the LST are derived using a statistical regression method from the numerical values simulated with an accurate atmospheric radiative transfer model MODTRAN 4 over a wide range of atmospheric and surface conditions. The simulation analysis shows that the LST can be estimated by the GSW algorithm with the root mean square error (RMSE) increasing by larger than 0.2 K when atmospheric anomalous profiles are involved. Taking into account the angular dependence of the top of the atmosphere radiance, six different viewing zenith angles (VZAs) are used in the simulations. Results show that the RMSEs become larger when the VZAs change form 0\u00b0to 60\u00b0.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium

serves as the gateway for international trade through the country's oldest port. This city has faced rapid population increase and industrial growth which are now causing environmental issues, social problems and economic stresses and challenges. Urban development and industrialization have extensively changed the landuse/landcover (LULC) and drainage pattern of the city. Majority of the old streams have been blocked that caused localized flash flooding in the city after heavy rainfall events. The natural drainage network of Karachi consists of two (2) major river systems - Malir River on the eastern side of the city and Lyari River which passes through the center of the city draining majority of its storm water. These rivers and their tributaries have been affected very badly due to the urbanization and bad urban management. This paper discusses the changes in LULCs over the past 16 years selecting Malir basin as a case study. Hydraulic flood modeling of Malir River is also presented here for 50 and 100 years floods. SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) Digital Elevation Model (1 Arc Second) and topographic sheets of 1975 and 2001 (1:50000) are used to demarcate natural drainage or Karachi District on digital maps and to delineate stream network using Geographical Information System (GIS) software tool Arc Hydro. Historical rainfall data are used to simulate runoff using hydrologic models HEC-HMS and GeoHMS. The flood extent is modeled using hydraulic models HEC-RAS and GeoRAS. GIS overlay analysis combines LULCs and river drainage layers to identify the blocked area and to quantify the specific LULCs that caused the river blockades. Maps of blockages and flood extent can be used for revival of natural drainage network and flood mitigation and preparedness. The beneficiaries of this study may include local disaster risk management, planning and development authorities.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730168","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730168.pdf","startPage":"4481","endPage":"4484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flash floods in Malir basin due to urbanization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730168","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730168/","displayDocTitle":"Flash floods in Malir basin due to urbanization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445821","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7730168/","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flash floods in Malir basin due to urbanization","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0004481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062829S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7730261,"authors":[{"name":"Rudolf Ressel","affiliation":["Maritime Safety and Security Lab, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Ressel","id":"37085432329"},{"name":"Suman Singha","affiliation":["Maritime Safety and Security Lab, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Singha","id":"38511509800"},{"name":"Susanne Lehner","affiliation":["Maritime Safety and Security Lab, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Susanne","lastName":"Lehner","id":"37269977100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730261","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sea ice","Synthetic aperture radar","Feature extraction","Remote sensing","Neural networks","Polarimetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","neural nets","radar polarimetry","remote sensing","sea ice","spaceborne radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network classifier","automatic sea ice classification","CL-POL RISAT-1 imagery","SAR polarimetry","spaceborne SAR based sea ice analysis","have SAR based remote sensing","synthetic aperture radar","imaged ground area coverage","radar response","single-polarimetric sensor acquisitions","dual polarimetric coverage","ground polarimetric coverage","hybrid polarimetric acquisitions","RISAT-1 satellite platform","hybrid dual pol acquisitions","algorithmic approach","feature extraction procedure","pixelwise supervised classification","eastern Greenland coast"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sea Ice","Feature Extraction","SAR","Compact Pol","RISAT-1"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730261","abstract":"SAR Polarimetry has become a valuable tool in spaceborne SAR based sea ice analysis. The two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large coverage of the imaged ground area, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. Whereas single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, dual polarimetric, or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid polarimetric acquisitions offer a trade-off between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of hybrid dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consists of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction procedure. The resulting feature vectors are then ingested into a trained neural network classifier to arrive at a pixelwise supervised classification. We present first results on a dataset acquired off the eastern Greenland coast.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730261","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730261.pdf","startPage":"4835","endPage":"4838","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based automatic sea ice classification for CL-pol RISAT-1 imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based automatic sea ice classification for CL-pol RISAT-1 imagery","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16444815","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7730261/","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based automatic sea ice classification for CL-pol RISAT-1 imagery","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0004835.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065634S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":7730264,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Xu","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Technology, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Norway"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085884164"},{"name":"Anthony P.

To effectively suppress the deceptive jamming generated by detecting parameters of target echoes, this work proposes a novel anti-jamming approach. Firstly, the chirp signal with varying initial phase is predesigned and transmitted. Then, the random initial phases of received echoes are removed before imaging. The imaging outputs of the deceptive jamming and real signal are derived through theoretical analysis. By comparing those signal models, we obtain that the proposed method induces the defocusing of false signal while the real signals are well focused. Finally, the performance of deceptive jamming suppression method is validated by simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deceptive jamming suppression for SAR based on time-varying initial phase","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730303","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730303.pdf","startPage":"4996","endPage":"4999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730303","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deceptive jamming suppression for SAR based on time-varying initial phase","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7730303/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446184","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deceptive jamming suppression for SAR based on time-varying initial phase","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0004996.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048099S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7730311,"authors":[{"name":"Tao-yong Li","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xi'an, China","Institute of Information and Navigation, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Tao-yong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085902164"},{"name":"Qun Zhang","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xi'an, China","Institute of Information and Navigation, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37275877700"},{"name":"Kai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Scientific Research, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085895927"},{"name":"Fu-fei Gu","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Navigation, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Fu-fei","lastName":"Gu","id":"38015278100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730311","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Antenna arrays","Three-dimensional displays","Azimuth","Receiving antennas","Image resolution","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","compressed sensing","MIMO radar","radar cross-sections","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel imaging method","airborne downward-looking 3D MIMO-SAR","compressed sensing","three-dimensional image","3D multiple-input-multiple-output synthetic aperture radar","CS theory","echo data","range domain","azimuth domain","image quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-SAR","Compressed Sensing","3D Imaging"]}],"abstract":"The three-dimensional (3D) image of target can be obtained by airborne downward-looking 3D multiple-input-multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR).

In our experiments, proposed method was applied for hyperspectral data in several different situations, and preferable classification performance were obtained through relative parameters adjustment, which were given recommended scope during our comparative experiments.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730323.pdf","startPage":"5075","endPage":"5078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional neural network based classification for hyperspectral data","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730323","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730323","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional neural network based classification for hyperspectral data","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446165","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7730323/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional neural network based classification for hyperspectral data","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0005075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049483S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7730324,"authors":[{"name":"Jingxiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussel, Belgium","School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, P.R.

Compared with conventional hand-crafted feature extraction, deep learning can learn feature with more discriminative information. In this paper, a two-channel deep convolutional neural network (Two-CNN) is proposed to learn jointly spectral-spatial feature from hyperspectral image. The proposed model is composed of two channels of CNN, each of which learns feature from spectral domain and spatial domain respectively. The learned spectral feature and spatial feature are then concatenated and fed to fully connected layer to extract joint spectral-spatial feature for classification. When number of training samples is limited, we propose to train the deep model using transfer learning to improve the performance. Low-layer and mid-layer features of the deep model are learned and transferred from other scenes, only top-layer feature is learned using the limited training samples of the current scene.

In this work, tile-based multilabel classification framework is adopted to overcome such issue. In particular, a given UAV-shot image is first subdivided into a grid of equal tiles. Next, deep neural network-induced features are extracted from each tile and then fed into a radial basis function neural network classifier in order to infer the corresponding object list. We apply a refinement step at the top of the complete deep network architecture to boost the classification results.

The spatial layout of buildings in functional zone show a specific pattern, e.g. residual areas usually have similar builds and the positions of which are highly organized. In this paper, we show that it is possible to identify urban functional zones from a remote sensed imagery. To this end, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) based functional zone classification method is proposed. The method mainly consists of three steps. Firstly, the aerial imagery of the city is partitioned into disjoint regions by road network. Then, each region is further divided into patches and is fed to a fully connected CNN. The output of which is considered as distributions of this patches on the five previously defined functional zones. Finally, we take a vote strategy to identify the function zone of this region. We test our method on a collection of Google Earth images over Shenyang, Beijing, etc. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16430211","htmlLink":"/document/7730419/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A CNN based functional zone classification method for aerial images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CNN based functional zone classification method for aerial images","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0005449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056159S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7730467,"authors":[{"name":"Erwan Motte","affiliation":["CESBIO (CNRS/UPS/IRD/CNES), Toulouse cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Erwan","lastName":"Motte","id":"37827695800"},{"name":"Mehrez Zribi","affiliation":["CESBIO (CNRS/UPS/IRD/CNES), Toulouse cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Mehrez","lastName":"Zribi","id":"37446267600"},{"name":"Pascal Fanise","affiliation":["CESBIO (CNRS/UPS/IRD/CNES), Toulouse cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Fanise","id":"37547414300"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Baup","affiliation":["CESBIO (CNRS/UPS/IRD/CNES), Toulouse cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Baup","id":"37695614900"},{"name":"Nicolas Baghdadi","affiliation":["IRSTEA, UMR TETIS, Montpellier cedex 5, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Baghdadi","id":"38319374800"},{"name":"Pierre-Louis Frison","affiliation":["Matis-IGN, UPEM, Marne la Vall\u00e9e Cedex 2"],"firstName":"Pierre-Louis","lastName":"Frison","id":"37350549000"},{"name":"Dominique Guyon","affiliation":["INRA, UMR 1391 ISPA, Villenave d'Ornon, France"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Guyon","id":"37269463300"},{"name":"Laurent Lestarquit","affiliation":["GRGS (CNES), Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Lestarquit","id":"38265394300"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Wigneron","affiliation":["INRA, UMR 1391 ISPA, Villenave d'Ornon, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Wigneron","id":"38280340900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730467","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"abstract":"The GLORIE GNSS-R airborne campaign was conducted in the late spring 2015 with the GLORI polarimetric receiver.

In this framework, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was recently proposed as an alternative method to Eigenvector decomposition to better interpret non-Gaussian heterogeneous clutter (inherent to high resolution SAR systems). Until now, the two main drawbacks reported of the aforementioned method are the greater number of samples required for an unbiased estimation, when compared to classical Eigenvector decomposition and the inability to be employed in scenarios under Gaussian clutter assumption. First, a Monte Carlo approach is performed in order to investigate the bias in estimating the Touzi Target Scattering Vector Model (TSVM) parameters when ICA is employed. A RAMSES X-band image acquired over Br\u00e9tigny, France is taken into consideration to investigate the bias estimation under different scenarios.

In our approach, a novel hyperspectral anomaly detector based on low-rank representation (LRR) and learned dictionary (LD) has been proposed. This method assumes that a two-dimensional matrix transformed from a three-dimensional hyperspectral imagery can be decomposed into two parts: a low rank matrix representing the background and a sparse matrix standing for the anomalies. Further, a dictionary learned from the whole image with a random selection process, which can be viewed as the spectra of the background only, is introduced into the decomposition process. The adoption of LD improves the robustness of LRR to its parameters with a less computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has a satisfactory result.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730531","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730531.pdf","startPage":"5860","endPage":"5863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel hyperspectral anomaly detector based on low-rank representation and learned dictionary","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730531","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730531/","displayDocTitle":"A novel hyperspectral anomaly detector based on low-rank representation and learned dictionary","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445291","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7730531/","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel hyperspectral anomaly detector based on low-rank representation and learned dictionary","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0005860.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055675S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7730532,"authors":[{"name":"Shengwei Zhong","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shengwei","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085463767"},{"name":"Ye Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085353444"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730532","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Detectors","Clustering algorithms","Gaussian mixture model","Contamination"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","hyperspectral imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadratic hyperspectral imagery modeling","hyperspectral image processing technologies","spectral characteristics","hyperspectral image background modeling","anomaly detection operator","anomaly detection method","background pixel judgment","quadratic background modeling","outlier contamination","semisimulated hyperspectral image","visual analysis","receiver operating characteristic curves","classic approaches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","quadratic modeling","Gaussian Mixture Model","hyperspectral imagery"]}],"abstract":"In hyperspectral image processing technologies, anomaly detection is a valuable and practical way of searching small unknown targets based on spectral characteristics. For the lack of prior knowledge of targets, background modeling on hyperspectral images is the key process that affects the outcome of anomaly detection operator. In this paper, a novel method of anomaly detection based on quadratic modeling is proposed. The innovation of the proposed algorithm is that it divides the detection process into two main steps: one is initial detection, which provides a preliminary judgment of background pixels; the other is the quadratic background modeling to reduce the contamination of outliers, consisting both anomaly pixels and abnormal background pixels. In the part of experiments, a semisimulated hyperspectral image and a real hyperspectral image are both used to evaluate the performance of our proposed method.

This process is composed by three stages where the extraction of endmembers is the most consuming step. However, endmember extraction algorithms (EEAs) can be computationally very expensive and its acceleration on parallel architectures is still an interesting and open problem. In this paper, we present a parallel implementation of the simplex growing algorithm for hyperspectral unmixing called P-SGA on different platforms using the OpenCL framework. The proposed implementation exploits the memory hierarchy to accelerate the parts of this method which are more time-consuming. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of both accuracy and computational performance through Monte Carlo simulations using the following architectures: multi-core Xeon CPU, NVidia GeForce GTX 980 GPU and Intel Xeon Phi accelerator. Experiments are conducted using real hyperspectral data set revealing considerable acceleration factors, which satisfies the real-time constraints given by the data acquisition rate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Graphics processing units","Acceleration","Kernel","Computer architecture","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","graphics processing units","hyperspectral imaging","microprocessor chips","Monte Carlo methods","multiprocessing systems","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral imaging","Intel Xeon Phi accelerator","NVidia GeForce GTX 980 GPU","multicore Xeon CPU","Monte Carlo simulations","memory hierarchy","OpenCL framework","P-SGA","hyperspectral unmixing","simplex growing algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","spectral unmixing","high performance computing (HPC)","simplex growing algorithm (SGA)","OpenCL"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730607","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730607","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730607.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730607","startPage":"6153","endPage":"6156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel implementation of the simplex growing algorithm for hyperspectral unmixing using OpenCL","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel implementation of the simplex growing algorithm for hyperspectral unmixing using OpenCL","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730607/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7730607/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445350","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel implementation of the simplex growing algorithm for hyperspectral unmixing using OpenCL","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0006153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070283S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7730609,"authors":[{"name":"Claude Cariou","affiliation":["TSI2M team, University of Rennes 1 / Enssat, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Cariou","id":"37375260400"},{"name":"Kacem Chehdi","affiliation":["TSI2M team, University of Rennes 1 / Enssat, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Kacem","lastName":"Chehdi","id":"37313378600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730609","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730609","abstract":"In this communication, we propose a new unsupervised clustering method, which uses a kNN graph to propagate labels, starting from high density regions of the representation space.

There are many approximations that consider spatial characteristics of the data in order to guide the endmember identification/extraction procedure. In particular, the spatial preprocessing (SPP) algorithm can be used prior to most existing spectral-based endmember identification techniques, thus promoting the selection of endmembers in spatially representative parts of the scene. The main concern regarding SPP and this kind of preprocessing techniques is that they are computational expensive, adding a significant burden to the spectral unmixing process which should be alleviated. In this paper we revisit and enhance a previously developed implementation of SPP for graphical processing units (GPUs) in order to increase its performance by exhaustively using the level one (L1)-cache level of the GPU. The performance of the proposed implementation is evaluated using an NVidiaTMGeForce GTX 580. Our experimental validation reveals that real-time processing performance can be obtained for real hyperspectral data sets collected by the Airborne Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS).","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730709","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730709.pdf","startPage":"6541","endPage":"6544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the optimization of memory access to increase the performance of spatial preprocessing techniques on graphics processing units","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the optimization of memory access to increase the performance of spatial preprocessing techniques on graphics processing units","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445588","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7730709/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the optimization of memory access to increase the performance of spatial preprocessing techniques on graphics processing units","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0006541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075544S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7730726,"authors":[{"name":"Prabhat Sharma","affiliation":["Instrument Research and Development Establishment, Raipur, Dehradun, Uttarakhand"],"firstName":"Prabhat","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085787649"},{"name":"Bambam Kumar","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Deptt., Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttarakhand"],"firstName":"Bambam","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085614841"},{"name":"Dharmendra Singh","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Deptt., Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttarakhand"],"firstName":"Dharmendra","lastName":"Singh","id":"37400555200"},{"name":"S.P.

Clutter and background reduction and detection of low dielectric constant buried object with variable soil conditionsare the challenging tasks in GPR. But available techniques are not able to extract the non-metallic target information, due to low dielectric constant. Therefore, this paper proposes a neural network and statistical mean to standard deviation threshold based approach for subtracting background and for enhancing the detection of low dielectric constant buried object. ANN approach is based on the collection of large amount background data with soil moisture variation. These background data statistically analysed to compute the mean to standard deviation thresholding. After that, motion filter estimate the actual pixel intensity of PVC pipe in linear manner. The results show that the enhanced target detection and background subtraction are achieved directly from proposed trained neural network.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730726","startPage":"6609","endPage":"6612","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730726.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-metallic pipe detection using SF-GPR: A new approach using neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ground penetrating radar","Biological neural networks","Clutter","Buried object detection","Soil moisture","Moisture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","ground penetrating radar","independent component analysis","neural nets","pipes","principal component analysis","radar computing","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonmetallic pipe detection","SF-GPR","neural network","mean subtraction","median removal","singular value decomposition","SVD","principal component analysis","PCA","independent component analysis","ICA","dielectric constant","variable soil","ANN approach","motion filter","target detection","background subtraction","neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPR","ANN","Data filter","training"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Non-metallic pipe detection using SF-GPR: A new approach using neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7730726/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16430010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-metallic pipe detection using SF-GPR: A new approach using neural network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0006609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052936S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7730730,"authors":[{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Collage of IOT, Hohai University, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Li","id":"37536969400"},{"name":"Xinnan Fan","affiliation":["Collage of IOT, Hohai University, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xinnan","lastName":"Fan","id":"37066126100"},{"name":"Xuewu Zhang","affiliation":["Collage of IOT, Hohai University, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xuewu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085893498"},{"name":"Puhuang Li","affiliation":["Collage of IOT, Hohai University, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Puhuang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085885723"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730730","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geology","Remote sensing","Detectors","Earth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","hyperspectral imaging","image processing","iterative methods","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiaperture anomaly detector","clutter background","supervised target detection","spectral content","background object","anomaly-free pixel","false alarm rate","hyperspectral cube","iterative process","statistical data","anomaly salience","fuzzy logical theory","defuzzification ruler"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","multi-aperture","fuzzy logical","false alarm rate"]}],"abstract":"Without priori information, anomaly detector has more important utility compared with supervised target detection. Many classical anomaly detectors have obtained perfect performance in many situations. However, there still have two problems which are correlated with accuracy of anomaly detector. Firstly, clutter background induced more and more difficult pixel which have moderate statistical difference. Then, ideal uncontaminated subset of clutter background is hard to be obtain which is used to estimate background model. Secondly, difference of spectral content of different background objects will effect salience of anomaly targets. And it is arbitrary that uncertain pixels is nominated as non-anomalies by one threshold. For above two problems, a multi-aperture anomaly detector is proposed in this paper. Without selection of anomaly-free pixels and accurate statistical model, the proposed anomaly detector is expected to decrease false alarm rate with clutter background. A multi-aperture division for hyperspectral cube is conducted by iterative process. Statistical data of ever subaperture will be named as basis, which represent spectral characteristic of a certain range of spectral cube. Then, anomaly salience is proposed to measure the difference between pixels and sub-aperture basis. On the other hand, continuity of membership value based on fuzzy logical theory is more suitable to nominate difficulty pixels which has moderate anomaly salience. At last defuzzification ruler can be used to fuse different detection results from multi-aperture.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730730","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730730.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","startPage":"6625","endPage":"6628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-aperture anomaly detector for clutter background","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730730","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-aperture anomaly detector for clutter background","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730730/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446196","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7730730/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-aperture anomaly detector for clutter background","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0006625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05145S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7730731,"authors":[{"name":"Shengyuan Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shengyuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37085901737"},{"name":"Linrang Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Linrang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280171200"},{"name":"Nan Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Liu","id":"38666954000"},{"name":"Shiyang Tang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shiyang","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085495109"},{"name":"Shanshan Zhao","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shanshan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085508151"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730731","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"abstract":"In this paper, a target detector with frequency diverse array (FDA) multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar in a homogenous environment is proposed.

To test its effectiveness, a site was chosen in Bertie County, North Carolina discovered in 2007. The Salmon Creek site (31BR264), as it is known, is partially understood from previous archaeological studies as the location of a 16th Century Native American village.

Preliminary results suggest the usefulness of this framework to a promising extent.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730798","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730798.pdf","startPage":"6890","endPage":"6893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CRF learning with CNN features for hyperspectral image segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"CRF learning with CNN features for hyperspectral image segmentation","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7730798/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446101","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CRF learning with CNN features for hyperspectral image segmentation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0006890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052146S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7730805,"authors":[{"name":"Claudia Paris","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Paris","id":"37085367112"},{"name":"Lorenzo Bruzzone","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Bruzzone","id":"37274827100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730805","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730805","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vegetation","Laser radar","Estimation","Feature extraction","Algorithm design and analysis","Analytical models","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forestry","optical radar","remote sensing by laser beam","vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven identification","growth-model class","single-tree stem diameter estimation","single tree level","high-density LiDAR data","growth condition","data-driven inference process","tree growth","forest density","forest topography","regression function","crown structure","soil fertility"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)","forest growth-model","tree parameters","remote sensing","forestry"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a growth-model based approach to the accurate estimation of stem diameter at single tree level by using high-density LiDAR data. First, we detect classes of trees characterized by different growth conditions by means of a data-driven inference process. To this end, all the environmental factors that can affect the growth of the tree (i.e., forest density and topography) are modeled and analyzed. Second, for each detected growth-model class a tailored regression function is trained to adapt the model on the considered class. The crown structure, the topography and the forest density are considered to accurately retrieve the stem diameter. Experiments carried out in mountainous scenario characterized by complex morphology and a wide range of soil fertility demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730805","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730805.pdf","startPage":"6918","endPage":"6921","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven identification of growth-model classes for the adaptive estimation of single-tree stem diameter in LiDAR data","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven identification of growth-model classes for the adaptive estimation of single-tree stem diameter in LiDAR data","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7730805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445061","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730805/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven identification of growth-model classes for the adaptive estimation of single-tree stem diameter in LiDAR data","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0006918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054744S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7730831,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085891325"},{"name":"Chein-I Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Chein-I","lastName":"Chang","id":"37276904900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730831","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Detectors","Hyperspectral imaging","Indexes","Signal to noise ratio","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","hyperspectral imaging","image sensors","image sequences","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple band selection","anomaly hyperspectral imagery detection","band selection","band prioritization","virtual dimensionality","sequential multiple band selection","MBS anomaly detection","successive multiple band selection","iterative process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Band selection","Dimensionality reduction (DR)","Multiple band selection (MBS)","Successive multiple band selection (SC-MBS)","Sequential multiple band selection (SQ-MBS)","Single band BS (SBS)"]}],"abstract":"This paper develops a new approach to band selection (BS), called multiple band selection (MBS), which does not require band prioritization to select bands but rather relies on applications to select bands.

High-order Markov random fields describe the neighborhood constraints in the statistical form that could be integrated into compressed sensing to improve the reconstruction performance of remote sensing images. To this end, we built a new energy model with high-order model of Markov random fields to reconstruct remote sensing images from sparse signals. The split Bregman method is used to solve the problem. The proposed method is tested on some multispectral satellite imageries to make clear that it outweighs state-of-the-art methods such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, Group-based Sparse Representation,

A reverse-time migration algorithm is developed to process the MIMO GPR dataset for obtaining a high-resolution image of the subsurface objects. The results of a laboratory experiment on a volcanic ash pit demonstrate that the upper and lower interfaces of a marble slab of 3 cm thickness buried at a depth up to 2 m can be clearly imaged. A full waveform inversion algorithm based on Born iterative method is applied to invert the dielectric properties of the subsurface objects. The preliminary results of a numerical experiment demonstrate that the dielectric permittivity of a subsurface cubic object can be accurately obtained using the MIMO GPR dataset at only six discrete frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730942","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730942.pdf","startPage":"7446","endPage":"7449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse-time migration and full waveform inversion applied to a stationary MIMO GPR system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730942","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730942/","displayDocTitle":"Reverse-time migration and full waveform inversion applied to a stationary MIMO GPR system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445103","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7730942/","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverse-time migration and full waveform inversion applied to a stationary MIMO GPR system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0007446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047489S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7730943,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Ambrosanio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Ambrosanio","id":"37085471969"},{"name":"Vito Pascazio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Vito","lastName":"Pascazio","id":"37267229100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730943","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Ground penetrating radar","Inverse problems","Buried object detection","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","ground penetrating radar","microwave imaging","radar imaging","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combining wavelet transform","compressive sensing","subsurface imaging","non-sparse targets","microwave imaging","noninvasive diagnostics","quantitative characterizations","inspected domains","ground penetrating radar applications","CS","wavelet decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering","Compressive Sensing (CS)","Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)","Wavelet Transform","Born Approximation (BA)"]}],"abstract":"Microwave imaging represent an emerging tool in the framework of noninvasive diagnostics, due to the potential advantages of providing quantitative characterizations of the inspected domains.

For further imagery analysis and interpretation, it demands better and more efficient polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) speckle-filtering algorithms. Inspired by the great success of stochastic denoising, our goal in this paper is to reduce speckle noise of PolSAR image with random walk model. Taking spatial distance into consideration, limited steps of random walks over small pixel neighbourhoods provides good stochastic samples, then the final estimation of denoised image based on transition probabilities is obtained. In addition, since polarimetric distance is used to measure the dissimilarities between pixels, the proposed method exploits both the spatial and polarimetric information. Despeckling results on simulated SAR data and real SAR data demonstrate that our method provides efficient speckle reduction as well as spatial resolution and polarimetric information preservation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730965","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07730965.pdf","startPage":"7533","endPage":"7536","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarimetric SAR speckle filtering based on stochastic sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Polarimetric SAR speckle filtering based on stochastic sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7730965/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445118","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7730965/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarimetric SAR speckle filtering based on stochastic sampling","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0007533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055087S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7730965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7730968,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Tanase","affiliation":["CEOSpaceTech, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania","Military Technical Academy, GEOINT Center, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Tanase","id":"37085749979"},{"name":"Mihai Datcu","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany","CEOSpaceTech, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Datcu","id":"37085360123"},{"name":"Dan Raducanu","affiliation":["Military Technical Academy, GEOINT Center, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Raducanu","id":"37064836600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7730968","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":516},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Computer architecture","Scattering","Neurons","Training","Optical filters","Microwave filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","feature extraction","image classification","synthetic aperture radar","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional deep belief network","polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data feature extraction","multilayer approach","stepwise discovery","spatially invariant features","fully sized PolSAR images","unsupervised manner","PolSAR patches","unsupervised classification algorithms","fully polarimetric multilook F-SAR image","Kaufbeuren airfield","Germany"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polarimetric synthetic aperture radar","convolutional deep belief network","unsupervised learning","feature extraction","F-SAR","classification"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a custom convolutional deep belief network for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data feature extraction.

From the detailed study of the noisiest 1000 pixels, we find that about 75% to 85% of them show the signature of a single-trap RTN behavior with three distinct signal levels, and about 96% of the characteristic time constants fall between 1 \u03bcs and 500 \u03bcs with the median around 10 \u03bcs at room temperature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS Image Sensor Random Telegraph Noise Time Constant Extraction From Correlated To Uncorrelated Double Sampling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society","doi":"10.1109/JEDS.2016.2623799","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245494/7792235/07731134.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JEDS.2016.2623799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7792235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"CMOS Image Sensor Random Telegraph Noise Time Constant Extraction From Correlated To Uncorrelated Double Sampling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7731134/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16577336","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"CMOS Image Sensor Random Telegraph Noise Time Constant Extraction From Correlated To Uncorrelated Double Sampling","sourcePdf":"jeds-chao-2623799-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083977S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245494","isNumber":"7792235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245494","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7792235","articleId":"7731134","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7731137,"authors":[{"name":"Jiajing Chen","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiajing","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-3491-1593","id":"38541861100"},{"name":"Xuefeng Yin","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xuefeng","lastName":"Yin","id":"37280166700"},{"name":"Li Tian","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Tian","id":"37585998200"},{"name":"Myung-Don Kim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung-Don","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404422200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7731137","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":878},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731137","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Delays","Predictive models","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Graph theory","Millimeter wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","millimetre wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave channel modeling","unified propagation graph theory","multipath radio propagation prediction","specular components","diffuse components","semideterministic graph modeling","multibounce DC","single-lobe directive model","single-bounce SC","measured channel characteristic","millimeter-wave propagation","office environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel modeling","millimeter-wave propagation","graph theory","single-lobe directive model"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a unified propagation graph modeling approach is proposed, which is applicable to predicting multipath radio propagation by considering both specular components (SCs) and diffuse components (DCs).

The result is achieved under the assumption that all the received signals are noncircular. When the incident signals are the coexistence of noncircular and circular signals, the conjugate ESPRIT will not valuable. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of the joint of direction of departure (DOD) and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, which is appropriate for the coexistence of noncircular and circular signals in bistatic MIMO radar. First, the received data model of the bistatic MIMO radar is given. Second, we modify the received signal model by the use of noncircularity characteristic. Third, we derive out the equation of spatially rotational invariant containing the DOD and DOA information. Last, we solve the equation to obtain the DOD and DOA by means of total least squares technology. The proposed algorithm has the three advantages. One is that it has better angle estimation accuracy than that of method which does not use the noncircularity characteristic. Another one is that it has more number of detectable incident signals. The last one is that the more number of noncircular signals, the higher angle estimation accuracy will be. Results from numerical experiments are used to show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2624561","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

A subset of these works is devoted to the acceleration of previously published unmixing algorithms for application under tight time constraints. For this purpose, hyperspectral unmixing algorithms are typically implemented onto high-performance computing architectures in which the operations involved are executed in parallel, which conducts to a reduction in the time required for unmixing a given hyperspectral image with respect to the sequential version of these algorithms. The speedup factors that can be achieved by means of these high-performance computing platforms heavily depend on the inherent level of parallelism of the algorithms to be executed onto them. However, the majority of the state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms were not originally conceived for being parallelized in an ulterior stage, which clearly restricts the amount of acceleration that can be reached. As far as advanced hyperspectral sensors have increasingly high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, it is hence mandatory to follow a new approach that consists of developing a new class of highly parallel unmixing solutions that can take full advantage of the characteristics of nowadays high-performance computing architectures. This paper represents a step forward toward this direction as it proposes a new parallel algorithm for fully unmixing a hyperspectral image together with its implementation onto two different NVIDIA graphic processing units (GPUs). The results obtained reveal that our proposal is able to unmix hyperspectral images with very different spatial patterns and size better and much faster than the best GPU-based unmixing chains up-to-date published, with independence of the characteristics of the selected GPU.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU-Based Processing Chain for Linearly Unmixing Hyperspectral

data detection in the uplink grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access systems based on approximate message passing (AMP) and expectation maximization (EM) algorithms. The proposed Joint-EM-AMP detection algorithm consists of three steps in each iteration. First, AMP decouples the superimposed received signal into uncoupled scalar problems. Then, at the denoising step, AMP computes the posterior means and variances of the transmitted symbols with the extended modulation constellation. The third step is to estimate user activity parameters using EM based on the frame-wise joint sparsity of user activity. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed Joint-EM-AMP algorithm demonstrates significant performance gain in terms of bit error rate, which will be verified in simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"21","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16723199","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7731144/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Message Passing-Based Joint User Activity and Data Detection for NOMA","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571105, 61501109, 61223001 and 61601119"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu NSF","grantNumber":"BK20140646"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council (CSC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Message Passing-Based Joint User Activity and Data Detection for NOMA","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-2624297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04952S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7874222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"7874222","articleId":"7731144","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7731155,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Yousefian","affiliation":["Power, Energy, and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/7880726/7731155/youse-2624264-small.gif","p":["Reza Yousefian (S\u201908) received the B.S. degree from the\n Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran and the M.S. degree from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in\n 2008 and 2011, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

However, the control of robots with joints driven by VSAs is challenging due to the inherited highly nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, a novel disturbance observer based adaptive neural network control is proposed for robotic systems with variable stiffness joints and subject to model uncertainties. By utilizing a high-dimensional integral Lyapunov function, adaptive neural network control is designed to compensate for the model uncertainties, and a disturbance observer is integrated to compensate for the nonlinear VSA dynamics, as well as the neural network approximation errors and external disturbance. The semiglobally uniformly ultimately boundness of the closed-loop control system has been theoretically established. Simulation and extensive experimental studies have also been presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2624260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7849237/07731156.pdf","startPage":"2236","endPage":"2245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2624260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Based Variable Stiffness Control of Uncertain Robotic Systems Using Disturbance Observer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Based Variable Stiffness Control of Uncertain Robotic Systems Using Disturbance Observer","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7731156/","accessionNumber":"16668352","volume":"64","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573147, 91520201 and 61473120"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou Research Collaborative Innovation Projects","grantNumber":"2014Y2-00507"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Research Collaborative Innovation Projects","grantNumber":"2013B010102010, 2014B090901056 and 2015B020214003"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Plan Project (Application Technology Research Foundation)","grantNumber":"2015B020233006"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2015AA042303"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Network Based Variable Stiffness Control of Uncertain Robotic Systems Using Disturbance Observer","sourcePdf":"tie-yang-2624260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100599S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7849237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7849237","articleId":"7731156","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7731160,"authors":[{"name":"Haedong Jang","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies Americas Corporation, Morgan Hill, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7776993/7731160/jang-2618922-small.gif","p":["Haedong Jang (S\u201909\u2013M\u201914) was born in Wonju, South Korea, in 1971.

Only one of the two amplifiers operates at the low power region like a Doherty amplifier, while both amplifiers are operating as a Chireix outphasing amplifier at the high power region, taking advantage of the high efficiency region of each operating mode. Quasi-envelope efficiency of both amplifier efficiency curves is extracted in a systematic way using only analog circuit design methods. The output combiner is used as an input splitter for the radio frequency input Chireix outphasing without using any digital signal processing. Input signal phase control versus power for outphasing operation is obtained by using only a linear circuit, exploiting the input impedance variation of nonideal devices. A 52.4-dBm peak output power, 6.6-dB back-off Doherty-Chireix combined amplifier, is built operating at 2.17 GHz. A 50% average power added efficiency was measured using 6-dB peak-to-average power ratio, 3.84 MHz modulated test signals. Class-B like efficiency behavior is obtained at the low power region without compromising the peak back-off efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and

Its features provide flexibility and superior scalability in spectrum allocation following the growing demands of Internet traffic. In this letter, we propose a novel approach to address the routing, modulation level, and spectrum allocation (RMLSA) problem through the use of a distance-adaptive modulation scheme that enables the routing of traffic through multiple hops in virtual topology, enabling smoothing out the spectrum continuity and transmission distance constraints. The results showed that the use of the proposed scheme provide a gain of up to 82% in the bandwidth blocking rate using 7% less spectral resources in the network compared with the literature. This proposal opens a new avenue for future research, allowing new solutions for RMLSA problem.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2624288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2624288","startPage":"282","endPage":"285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07731180.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Distance-Adaptive Modulation Scheme for Elastic Optical Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"New Distance-Adaptive Modulation Scheme for Elastic Optical Networks","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668394","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7731180/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)","grantNumber":"445818/2014-0"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Distance-Adaptive Modulation Scheme for Elastic Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-drummond-2624288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057419S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7731180","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7731182,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Zomorrodi","affiliation":["RFS Company, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7847453/7731182/zomor-2616865-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Zomorrodi (S\u201911\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran, in 1995, the M.Sc. degree in communication engineering from the K.

Slow imaging in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique due to the moving reader antenna is replaced by a stationary multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array antenna. The proposed MIMO technique requires a large number of antenna elements, which impedes practical implementation of the reader. An optimized MIMO system through a genetic algorithm halves the number of antenna elements and successfully replaces the conventional SAR. The optimized antenna system combines with the original spatial diversity approach to provide a low-cost solution for chipless RFID tagging with enhanced content capacity. The system successfully decodes a 60-GHz 17-b chipless tag in an area that is one fifth of a credit card. The tag can be printed with a low-resolution printer and read on metal and liquid containers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7847453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2616865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7847453/07731182.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"669","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2616865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized MIMO-SAR Technique for Fast EM-Imaging of Chipless RFID System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimized MIMO-SAR Technique for Fast EM-Imaging of Chipless RFID System","volume":"65","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7731182/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16652161","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP110105606"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized MIMO-SAR Technique for Fast EM-Imaging of Chipless RFID System","sourcePdf":"tmtt-zomorrodi-2616865-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067664S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7847453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7847453","articleId":"7731182","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7731188,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Chieh Chen","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Chieh","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280673400"},{"name":"Chao-Kai Wen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Kai","lastName":"Wen","id":"37280263500"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425400"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7731188","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contamination","MIMO","Optimization","Interference","Complexity theory","Indexes","Partial transmit sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","optimisation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity pilot scheduling algorithm","massive MIMO","multiple-input multiple-output cellular networks","MIMO cellular networks","multi-user multi-cell massive MIMO systems","pilot scheduling problem","optimization problem","cross-entropy optimization framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-entropy optimization","interference","massive MIMO","pilot contamination","pilot scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Pilot contamination is a fundamental bottleneck in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular networks.

Digital PLLs can help reduce area but their jitter performance is severely degraded by quantization error. Specifically, their deterministic jitter (DJ), which is proportional to the loop update rate becomes prohibitively large at low reference clock frequencies. We propose a scrambling TDC (STDC) to improve DJ performance and a cascaded architecture with digital multiplying delay locked loop as the first stage and hybrid analog/digital PLL as the second stage to achieve low random jitter in a power efficient manner. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process, the prototype frequency synthesizer consumes 4.76 mW power from a 1.0 V supply and generates 160 MHz and 2.56 GHz output clocks from a 1.25 MHz crystal reference frequency. The long-term absolute jitter of the 160 MHz digital MDLL and 2.56 GHz digital PLL outputs are 2.4 psrms and 4.18 psrms, while the peak-to-peak jitter are 22.1 ps and 35.2 ps, respectively. The proposed frequency synthesizer occupies an active die area of 0.16mm2 and achieves power efficiency of 1.86 mW/GHz.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8919/7835743/7731190-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16637909","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7731190/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 1-to-2048 Fully-Integrated Cascaded Digital Frequency Synthesizer for Low Frequency Reference Clocks Using Scrambling TDC","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Center for Design of Analog-Digital Integrated Circuit (CDADIC)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF) under a CAREER","grantNumber":"EECS-0954969"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A 1-to-2048 Fully-Integrated Cascaded Digital Frequency Synthesizer for Low Frequency Reference Clocks Using Scrambling TDC","sourcePdf":"tcsi-nandwana-2609855-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073272S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7835743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7835743","articleId":"7731190","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7731192,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Ye","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7731192/ye-2624273-small.gif","p":["Jian Ye (S\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2012, and the M.Sc. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.","His research interests include power electronics for various applications such as connecting renewable energy sources, energy devices to microgrids, and power quality compensation."]},"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Ye","orcid":"0000-0002-5333-4704","id":"37086216472"},{"name":"Hoay Beng Gooi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7731192/gooi-2624273-small.gif","p":["Hoay Beng Gooi (SM\u201995) received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University in 1978, the M.S. degree from the University of New Brunswick in 1980, and the Ph.D. degree from Ohio State University in 1983, all in electrical engineering.","From 1983 to 1985, he was an Assistant Professor with Lafayette College, Easton.

However, the high manufacturing cost is a huge challenge of popularizing the UPQC system. This paper investigates the optimal size of the UPQC system based on the compensation requirements. A generalized strategy is proposed to optimize the size of the UPQC system, which determines the fundamental ratings of the shunt converter, series converter, and series transformer. A data-driven control (DDC)-based controller is developed using the variable phase angle control method to realize the implementation of the designed UPQC system under the different compensating conditions. Moreover, the MATLAB and OPAL-RT simulation results validate the practicability of the generalized strategy and the DDC-based controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loading","Optimization","Power quality","Mathematical model","Picture archiving and communication systems","Voltage fluctuations","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","control system synthesis","distributed power generation","phase control","power convertors","power supply quality","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified power quality conditioner","optimal size","variable phase angle control method","data-driven control design","UPQC system size optimization","microgrids","high manufacturing cost","compensation requirements","generalized strategy","shunt converter","series converter","series transformer","DDC-based controller","compensating conditions","OPAL-RT simulation","Matlab"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unified power quality conditioner (UPQC)","voltage sag and swell","volt-ampere (VA) optimization","phase angle control (PAC) method","Data-driven control (DDC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2624273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07731192.pdf","startPage":"2999","endPage":"3008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2624273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of the Size of UPQC System Based on Data-Driven Control Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of the Size of UPQC System Based on Data-Driven Control Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731192/","volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7731192/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17857437","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Energy Innovation Programme Office through the National Research Foundation and Singapore Economic Development Board."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of the Size of UPQC System Based on Data-Driven Control Design","sourcePdf":"tsg-ye-2624273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11113S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7731192","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7731197,"authors":[{"name":"Rajkumar Ramadoss","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Rajkumar","lastName":"Ramadoss","id":"37085837568"},{"name":"Mehran Mozaffari Kermani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mehran","lastName":"Mozaffari Kermani","orcid":"0000-0003-4513-3109","id":"38274063800"},{"name":"Reza Azarderakhsh","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Azarderakhsh","orcid":"0000-0002-6921-6868","id":"37659099500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7731197","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":615},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Circuit faults","Computer architecture","Registers","Signal processing algorithms","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware architectures","CORDIC algorithm","fixed-angle-rotation operation","vectors","coordinate rotation digital computer","field-programmable gate array","reliability requirements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC)","fault detection","reliability"]}],"abstract":"Fixed-angle-rotation operation of vectors is widely used in signal processing, robotics, and graphics.

In this brief, we propose efficient error detection schemes for cascaded single-rotation CORDIC which hamper the performance of the architectures negligibly. We present signature-based schemes for this CORDIC variant to detect both transient and permanent faults. We further present how such schemes can be applied to other variants of CORDIC. The effectiveness of the proposed designs is assessed through field-programmable gate array implementations and error simulations. The results give confidence for the proposed efficient architectures which can be tailored based on the reliability requirements and overhead tolerance.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2624508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7995149/07731197.pdf","startPage":"972","endPage":"976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7995149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2624508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable Hardware Architectures of the CORDIC Algorithm With a Fixed Angle of Rotations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Reliable Hardware Architectures of the CORDIC Algorithm With a Fixed Angle of Rotations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731197/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17136425","htmlLink":"/document/7731197/","volume":"64","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004361","fundingName":"Texas Instruments Faculty Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable Hardware Architectures of the CORDIC Algorithm With a Fixed Angle of Rotations","sourcePdf":"tcsii-mozaffarikermani-2624508-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054493S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7995149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7995149","articleId":"7731197","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7731198,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Feng Gao","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Feng","lastName":"Gao","orcid":"0000-0001-9338-3511","id":"37085405247"},{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-8351-6816","id":"37292661100"},{"name":"Changyun Wen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Changyun","lastName":"Wen","id":"37280264000"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-8351-6816","id":"37280461100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7731198","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":451},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Closed loop systems","Circuits and systems","Lyapunov methods","Feedback control","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","digital control","nonlinear systems","perturbation techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital event-based control","closed-loop ETC systems","Zeno behavior","exponentially converging threshold signals","ETM","event-triggering mechanisms","perturbation theorem","nonlinear systems","event-triggered control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Event-triggered control (ETC)","nonlinear systems","perturbation theorem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731198","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7956382/07731198.pdf","startPage":"807","endPage":"811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2624421","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2624421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7956382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Event-Based Control for Nonlinear Systems Without the Limit of ISS","abstract":"In this brief, the problem of event-triggered control (ETC) for nonlinear systems is considered.

These systems are based on coupled defected ground structure (DGS) resonators. Two types of DGSs (H-shape and semi-H-shape) are proposed. The semi-H-shaped DGS realizes larger inductance value, and this results in higher WPT efficiency. Instead of using an inductive-fed resonant coupling, we propose capacitive-fed resonant coupling, which reduces the design complexity and enhances the efficiency further. The DGS resonator of both the systems is loaded by chip capacitors for miniaturization. An equivalent circuit using approximate quasi-static modeling is extracted. An analytical design procedure is developed to calculate the optimum design parameters for the proposed WPT systems. The optimized structures are fabricated and measured. The simulation and measurement results are in good agreement. The proposed semi-H-shaped DGS WPT system has a peak efficiency of 73% at a transmission distance of 25 mm. In turn, the figure of merit becomes the highest among the WPT systems proposed so far.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Technique for Compact Size Wireless Power Transfer Applications Using Defected Ground Structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2618919","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7847453/07731202.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2618919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7847453","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731202/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Technique for Compact Size Wireless Power Transfer Applications Using Defected Ground Structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7731202/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16652172","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C)","grantNumber":"16K06301"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004721","fundingName":"VLSI Design and Education Center (VDEC) at the University of Tokyo in collaboration with the Keysights Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003008","fundingName":"Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), Cairo, Egypt"},{"fundingName":"Egypt\u2013Japan University of Science and Technology, Alexandria, Egypt"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Technique for Compact Size Wireless Power Transfer Applications Using Defected Ground Structures","sourcePdf":"tmtt-hekal-2618919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089399S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7847453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7847453","articleId":"7731202","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7731203,"authors":[{"name":"Javad Khazaei","affiliation":["School of Science, Engineering, and Technology, Penn State Harrisburg, Middletown, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7731203/khaza-2624144-small.gif","p":["Javad Khazaei (S\u201910\u2013M\u201916) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Mazandaran University, Iran, in 2009 and the master\u2019s degree from Urmia University, Iran, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of South Florida in Summer 2016.

Both local information (SoC and power level) and neighbors' information (SoC and power level) will be fed into an integral control installed at every battery converter. The design is based on consensus control and takes into consideration of real-world battery coordination requirements, e.g., all batteries should work in the same charging or discharging mode. Compared with the consensus control in the existing literature for voltage consensus or battery SoC/power consensus, this paper offers a simple design. The major assumption of this paper is that each converter should possess an integral control. This assumption is valid since indeed integral controls exist if converters are equipped with secondary frequency control. The designed consensus control is validated by simulations on 14-bus microgrid and IEEE 57-bus power system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the consensus integral control for variety modes of operation: 1) charging; 2) discharging; and 3) load variation.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2624144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07731203.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2624144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","startPage":"3009","endPage":"3017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus Control for Energy Storage Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Consensus Control for Energy Storage Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857411","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7731203/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus Control for Energy Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"tsg-miao-2624144-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103213S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7731203","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7731206,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik Thirumala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Indore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7731206/thiru-2624313-small.gif","p":["Karthik Thirumala (S\u201914) received the M.Tech. degree in power electronics from the VNR Vignan Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad, India, in 2012.

The proposed approach first investigates the presence of low-frequency interharmonics and then tunes the wavelet for decomposition of signal into fundamental and harmonic components. The tuning of Q-factor and redundancy makes the filter design to accurately extract the fundamental frequency component from a distorted input signal. Then, a unique set of features, which clearly reveal the characteristics of disturbances, are extracted. The power quality disturbances are broadly categorized into two groups based on the pre-obtained information of low-frequency interharmonics. Therefore, multiple disturbances are recognized by employing a dual MSVM, one for each group. Results demonstrate the applicability, strength, and accuracy of the proposed approach for classification of single and combined disturbances under different noisy conditions. Moreover, to illustrate the prominence of the features extracted from TQWT, two more classifiers based on decision tree and feedforward neural network have been employed for classification of power quality disturbances.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2624313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07731206.pdf","startPage":"3018","endPage":"3028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2624313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform and Dual Multiclass SVM for Online Automatic Detection of Power Quality Disturbances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731206/","displayDocTitle":"Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform and Dual Multiclass SVM for Online Automatic Detection of Power Quality Disturbances","volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857435","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7731206/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform and Dual Multiclass SVM for Online Automatic Detection of Power Quality Disturbances","sourcePdf":"tsg-thirumala-2624313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1294S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7731206","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7731207,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It provides high sampling rate for the servo control of the mechanical actuation system, which is thus enabled to quickly respond to high-frequency vibrations and achieve high positioning accuracy. The servo performance of the dedicated servo HDDs is investigated by applying low-frequency external vibrations, and its advantages over conventional servo are evaluated and verified. Dual-stage actuation mechanism is further applied to enhance the servo performance for effective utilizing the high sampling rate for the servo control. The high servo bandwidth, such as 5 and 10 kHz, is then achieved with sufficient position error signal (PES) samples provided by the dedicated servo. Not only to the low-frequency vibrations, the servo control loop with the high servo bandwidth is also able to significantly reduce the audio vibration impact on the PES.

These failures are called data-dependent failures. Detecting and mitigating these failures online while the system is running in the field enables optimizations that improve reliability, latency, and energy efficiency of the system. All these optimizations depend on accurately detecting every possible data-dependent failure that could occur with any content in DRAM. Unfortunately, detecting all data-dependent failures requires the knowledge of DRAM internals specific to each DRAM chip. As internal DRAM architecture is not exposed to the system, detecting data-dependent failures at the system-level is a major challenge. Our goal in this work is to decouple the detection and mitigation of data-dependent failures from physical DRAM organization such that it is possible to detect failures without knowledge of DRAM internals. To this end, we propose MEMCON , a memory content-based detection and mitigation mechanism for data-dependent failures in DRAM. MEMCON does not detect every possible data-dependent failure. Instead, it detects and mitigates failures that occur with the current content in memory while the programs are running in the system. Using experimental data from real machines, we demonstrate that MEMCON is an effective and low-overhead system-level detection and mitigation technique for data-dependent failures in DRAM.","doi":"10.1109/LCA.2016.2624298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/10208/8240814/07731210.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCA.2016.2624298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Case for Memory Content-Based Detection and Mitigation of Data-Dependent Failures in DRAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731210","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10208/8240814/7731210-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Dec. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Case for Memory Content-Based Detection and Mitigation of Data-Dependent Failures in DRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731210/","publicationDate":"1 July-Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17468491","htmlLink":"/document/7731210/","volume":"16","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001744","fundingName":"ISTC-CC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation"},{"fundingName":"CAREER","grantNumber":"CCF-0953246"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1212962, CNS-1320531 and CCF-1566483"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Case for Memory Content-Based Detection and Mitigation of Data-Dependent Failures in DRAM","sourcePdf":"lca-khan-2624298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078263S","chronDate":"July-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"8240814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8240814","articleId":"7731210","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7731216,"authors":[{"name":"Byeong Yong Kong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeong Yong","lastName":"Kong","orcid":"0000-0003-3524-2838","id":"38260479900"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","orcid":"0000-0003-3524-2838","id":"37086008834"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7731216","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":708},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"This brief presents an improved sorting architecture for K-best multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection. In the proposed architecture, two properties of the K-best MIMO detection are exploited for simplifications: the order among siblings from the same parent node can be easily identified; the order among the K-best nodes is dispensable. Besides, the generalized mergesort-based architecture for the K-best sorting is presented so that the proposed sorter can be constructed for any power-of-two K and modulation scheme. Compared to the conventional ones, the proposed architecture lowers not only the hardware complexity but also the latency significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8016697/07731216.pdf","startPage":"1042","endPage":"1046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2624304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2624304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8016697","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Sorting Architecture for --Best MIMO Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Sorting","Circuits and systems","Hardware","Complexity theory","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved sorting architecture","k-best MIMO detection","K-best multiple-input multiple-output detection","generalized merge sort-based architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["K-best multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection","mergesort","sorting","wireless communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Improved Sorting Architecture for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${K}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Best MIMO Detection","volume":"64","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7731216/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135432","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"MSIP as GFP","grantNumber":"CISS-2011-0031860"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"NRF through MSIP","grantNumber":"2010-0028680"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Sorting Architecture for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${K}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Best MIMO Detection","sourcePdf":"tcsii-park-2624304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07407S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8016697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","xplore-issue":"8016697","articleId":"7731216","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7731217,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Hun Jun","affiliation":["Circuit Research Division, LG Display, Paju, South Korea","Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9425/7572227/7731217/jun-2624300-small.gif","p":["Jae-Hun Jun received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical\n engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

A touch electrode is implemented with a segmented common electrode of an LCD display. The display system of the in-cell touch panel is 5.7-in a-Si HD (720 \u00d7 1280), the number of touch electrodes is 576 (18 \u00d7 32), and the sensor pitch is approximately 4 mm. Compared to the display-only system, display performance degradation does not occur in the proposed system since in-cell technology is adopted. Despite using a self-capacitance sensing method in the panel, unlimited multitouch is available by using an all-point sensing scheme; this system shows a touch accuracy of less than 0.2 mm and signal-to-noise ratio is measured to be more than 48 dB in the entire panel without any digital filter. To enhance the touch performance, we proposed noise reduction techniques that are strongly related to the display operation, such as base line compensation, delta adding correlated double sampling, and the use of a high-voltage charge compensator. The power consumption including micro controller unit (MCU) is less than 30 mW.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731217/","volume":"12","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7731217/","accessionNumber":"16614881","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"In-Cell Self-Capacitive-Type Mobile Touch System and Embedded Readout Circuit in Display Driver IC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-Cell Self-Capacitive-Type Mobile Touch System and Embedded Readout Circuit in Display Driver IC","sourcePdf":"jdt-kim-2624300-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.203541S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"7572227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7572227","articleId":"7731217","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7731221,"authors":[{"name":"Minho Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Minho Yang (S\u201913) received his B.S. degree from the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2012.

In this paper, the design of an on-board active rectifier and dc-dc converter for interfacing the receiver coil of a 50 kW/85 kHz IPT system is designed. Both conversion stages employ 1.2 kV SiC MOSFET devices for their low switching losses. For the dc-dc conversion, a modular, nonisolated buck+boost-type topology with coupled magnetic devices is used for increasing the power density.

A new frame structure is proposed for the considered networks. In the considered network, a wireless power transfer model is proposed, and the closed-form expressions for the power outage probability are derived. In addition, in order to reduce the energy consumption at SUs, sub-Nyquist sampling are performed at SUs. Subsequently, compressive sensing and matrix completion techniques are invoked to recover the original signals at the fusion center by utilizing the sparsity property of spectral signals. Throughput optimizations of the secondary networks are formulated into two linear constrained problems, which aim to maximize the throughput of a single SU and the whole cooperative network, respectively. Three methods are provided to obtain the maximal throughput of secondary networks by optimizing the time slots allocation and the transmit power. Simulation results show that the maximum throughput can be improved by implementing compressive spectrum sensing in the proposed frame structure design.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7900485/07731231.pdf","startPage":"1464","endPage":"1476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Powered Cognitive Radio Networks With Compressive Sensing and Matrix Completion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Powered Cognitive Radio Networks With Compressive Sensing and Matrix Completion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731231/","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16808428","htmlLink":"/document/7731231/","volume":"65","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Powered Cognitive Radio Networks With Compressive Sensing and Matrix Completion","sourcePdf":"tcomm-qin-2623606-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100066S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7900485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7900485","articleId":"7731231","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7731233,"authors":[{"name":"SaiDhiraj Amuru","affiliation":["Samsung Research & Development Institute, Bengaluru, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7731233/amuru-2624291-small.gif","p":["SaiDhiraj Amuru (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from IIT Madras, Chennai, India, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Virginia Tech in 2015.

Specifically, we consider a network of base stations (BSs) or access points (APs) and investigate the impact of a fixed number of jammers that are randomly deployed according to a Binomial point process. We investigate the network performance in terms of: 1) the outage probability and 2) the error probability of a victim receiver in the downlink of this wireless network. We derive analytical expressions for both these metrics and discuss in detail how the jammer network must adapt to the various wireless network parameters in order to effectively attack the victim receivers. For instance, we will show that with only 1 jammer per BS/AP: 1) the outage probability of the wireless network can be increased from 1% (as seen in the non-jamming case) to 80% and 2) when retransmissions are used, the jammers cause the effective network activity factor (and hence the interference among the BSs) to be doubled. Furthermore, we show that the behavior of the jammer network as a function of the BS/AP density is not obvious. In particular, a non-trivial behavior is seen, which indicates that the number of jammers required to attack the wireless network must scale with the BS density only until a certain value beyond which it decreases. In the context of error probability of the victim receiver, we study whether or not some recent results related to jamming in the point-to-point link scenario can be extended to the case of jamming against wireless networks. Numerical results are presented to validate all the theoretical inferences presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731233/","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7731233/","accessionNumber":"16618459","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Jamming Against Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Jamming Against Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-amuru-2624291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106869S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7731233","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7731235,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Carrer","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7801970/7731235/carre-2616949-small.gif","p":["Leonardo Carrer received the B.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy, in 2010, and the M.Sc.

They are widely employed for monitoring changes to the polar ice sheets and for the study of planetary bodies (e.g., Mars). The analysis of the very large amount of data produced by such systems requires the development of automatic techniques for an objective, accurate, and fast extraction of relevant information from radargrams. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for the automatic detection of layer boundaries based on a local scale hidden Markov model (HMM), which models the radar response in the presence of a layer boundary, and the Viterbi algorithm (VA, which performs the inference step). The proposed technique is based on a divide and conquer strategy that executes the VA using the observation data and the HMM to infer the most likely layer boundary location within a small radargram portion. Finally, a detection strategy is defined to chain together the inferred local layer locations. Furthermore, a novel radargram enhancement and denoising technique tailored to support the detection step is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been confirmed by testing it on different radargrams acquired by shallow radar over the north pole of Mars. The results obtained point out the superiority of the proposed method in retrieving the position of each layer boundary (and thus of the related intensity and geometric properties) with respect to the state-of-the-art techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2616949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7801970/07731235.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2016.2616949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801970","startPage":"962","endPage":"977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Enhancement and Detection of Layering in Radar Sounder Data Based on a Local Scale Hidden Markov Model and the Viterbi Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Enhancement and Detection of Layering in Radar Sounder Data Based on a Local Scale Hidden Markov Model and the Viterbi Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16596860","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7731235/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003981","fundingName":"Italian Space Agency","grantNumber":"ASI/INAF n"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Enhancement and Detection of Layering in Radar Sounder Data Based on a Local Scale Hidden Markov Model and the Viterbi Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bruzzone-2616949-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102188S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7801970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7801970","articleId":"7731235","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7731239,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Hiasat","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Princess Sumaya University for Technology, Amman, Jordan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7809129/7731239/hiasa-2612723-small.gif","p":["Ahmad Hiasat received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Jordan and the Ph.D. degree in systems engineering from Oakland University, Rochester, MI, in 1995.","He then joined Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT), Amman, Jordan.

Due to the increase in demand for the QoS sensitive services, an efficient QoS-aware transmission strategy that improves the system performance is required urgently. Many efforts have been devoted to addressing this problem with the assumption of block fading channel in a frame duration. However, due to the frequent channel quality variation in a frame duration and serious inter channel interference in HSR scenario, the throughput of the QoS sensitive services degrades severely. Hence, a robust cross-layer transmission strategy that combines adaptive modulation (AM) scheme with truncated automatic repeat request protocol is proposed. In this cross-layer formulation, the normalized average throughput is optimized subject to the average power and the packet loss rate (PLR) requirements. First, we derive the closed form average bit error rate that represents the PLR requirement at the physical layer. Second, we obtain the solution of robust AM scheme and power allocation policy in the case of continuous rate. Third, we present the adaptive bits and power allocation scheme in the case of discrete rate, which can be implemented in practice. Finally, the performance of the proposed transmission strategy is evaluated by extensive simulations. Comparing with the constant transmit power AM scheme, the throughput increases by 20%, which demonstrates that the proposed robust cross-layer design is suitable for the HSR communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2623490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07731241.pdf","startPage":"7289","endPage":"7300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2623490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust QoS-Aware Cross-layer Design of Adaptive Modulation Transmission on OFDM Systems in High-Speed Railway","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731241/","displayDocTitle":"Robust QoS-Aware Cross-layer Design of Adaptive Modulation Transmission on OFDM Systems in High-Speed Railway","volume":"4","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16470547","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7731241/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015YJS023"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005023","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety","grantNumber":"RCS2015K011 and RCS2015ZT001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501023, U1534201 and U1334202"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Research Programme of China Railway Corporation","grantNumber":"2016X003-O"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust QoS-Aware Cross-layer Design of Adaptive Modulation Transmission on OFDM Systems in High-Speed Railway","sourcePdf":"access-gao-2623490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151184S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7731241","onlineDate":"02 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7731243,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Guan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7981437/7731243/guan-2624504-small.gif","p":["Ke Guan (S\u201910\u2013M\u201913) received the B.E. and the Ph.D.\n degrees in communication and information system from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2014,\n respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety and the School\n of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University.

However, due to process variations, parameter mismatches arise and lead to Fixed-Pattern Noise (FPN), which occurs across the APS array. A common technique to reduce FPN is the use of Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) in voltage mode to reduce the FPN, but it increases the complexity of either the pixel or the external circuitry. This paper, on the other hand, presents a CDS circuit operating in current mode to reduce FPN. The subtraction operation in current mode requires simpler circuitry, optimizing the trade-off between FPN reduction and the demand for silicon area. This technique does not require any topology change in the APS pixel itself or in its basic operation cycle.

It is applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous parallel architectures, and can also be used for balancing memory on distributed memory architectures.","doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2016.7731461","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600991/7731371/07731461.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2016.7731461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple method for static load balancing of parallel FDTD codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731461/","displayDocTitle":"A simple method for static load balancing of parallel FDTD codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16446947","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7731461/","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple method for static load balancing of parallel FDTD codes","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056048S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600991","isNumber":"7731371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600991","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7731371","articleId":"7731461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7731492,"authors":[{"name":"Hatim F.

However, traditional architectures are closed and ossified, which causes wireless networks to become complicated, inflexible, and expensive. As a result, there are several challenges for management and QoS guarantees that should be addressed. In order to solve these challenges, a new architecture should be designed. To this end, SDN techniques have been a hot topic due to the advantages of flexibility and cost efficiency. In this article, we first introduce the basic idea of SDN and discuss the reason why using software defined wireless networking (SDWN) is necessary. Second, we review some typical SDWN-based architectures, and show a hierarchical mobile cloud computing based software defined wireless network (MCC-SDWN) for fifth generation wireless networks. Next, the state-of-the-art work on resource allocation for MCC-SDWN is reviewed. For performance evaluation and simulation, some mainstream implemental tools and simulation platforms are introduced.

These methods are non-invasive and convenient to detect Diabetes Mellitus, which are different from the traditional diagnostic methods. In this paper, we propose a new method composed of Gray-scale Histogram Features, Diabetes Mellitus genetic algorithm, and a classifier (k-Nearest Neighbors) with weights to detect Diabetes Mellitus using four facial blocks extracted from the facial image. Firstly, Gray-scale Histogram Features, which represents the distribution of gray-scale values in the image, are extracted from each block to represent it. Next, Diabetes Mellitus genetic algorithm based on genetic algorithm is proposed to select features from the Gray-scale Histogram Features of each block. Finally, k-Nearest Neighbors with weights is used to classify Diabetes Mellitus and Healthy samples. The proposed method is tested on a facial image dataset consisting of 284 Diabetes Mellitus and 142 Healthy samples, which obtains an accuracy of 99.48%.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2016.7731621","pdfPath":"/iel7/7601067/7731613/07731621.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2016.7731621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using K-NN with weights to detect diabetes mellitus based on genetic algorithm feature selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Using K-NN with weights to detect diabetes mellitus based on genetic algorithm feature selection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16430424","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7731621/","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using K-NN with weights to detect diabetes mellitus based on genetic algorithm feature selection","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0121520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060931S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7601067","isNumber":"7731613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7601067","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7731613","articleId":"7731621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7731638,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Yu Lu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Cheng-Yu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085904747"},{"name":"Bing-Zhong Jing","affiliation":["Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bing-Zhong","lastName":"Jing","id":"37902608100"},{"name":"Patrick P.

However, because of the movement of patients' eyes and limitation of medical equipments, the quality of fundus images may be low sometimes. In this paper, we propose vessel enhancement method for a low-contrast and blurred image based on multi-scale morphological top-hat transformation, and the combination of Gabor and matched filter. The underlying rationale of this proposed method is to make use different kinds of information to improve blood vessels on retinal fundus images with poor quality. Experiments show that vessels enhanced by our proposed method are much clearer than the ones using original multi-scale morphological top-hat transformation, Gabor filter or matched filter. The results confirm that the quality of vessel enhancement can be improved by combining these methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2016.7731638","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR)","startPage":"168","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2016.7731638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731613","pdfPath":"/iel7/7601067/7731613/07731638.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Retina","Biomedical imaging","Shape","Kernel","Blood vessels","Histograms","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood vessels","diseases","eye","Gabor filters","image restoration","matched filters","mathematical morphology","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vessel enhancement","fundus image quality","mathematical morphology","Gabor filter","matched filter","retinopathy diagnosis","cardiovascular disease diagnosis","low-contrast image","image deblurring","multiscale morphological top-hat transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Retina","Fundus image","Vessel enhancement","Matched filter","Gabor filter","Morphology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Vessel enhancement of low quality fundus image using mathematical morphology and combination of Gabor and matched filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731638/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7731638/","accessionNumber":"16430408","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vessel enhancement of low quality fundus image using mathematical morphology and combination of Gabor and matched filter","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1681532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058655S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7601067","isNumber":"7731613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7601067","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7731613","articleId":"7731638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7731675,"authors":[{"name":"Karim El Bouyahyiouy","affiliation":["TIME, MOHAMMED V UNIVERSITY, RABAT, MOROCCO"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"El Bouyahyiouy","id":"37085902326"},{"name":"Adil Bellabdaoui","affiliation":["TIME, ENSIAS, MOHAMMED V UNIVERSITY IN RABAT, Morocco"],"firstName":"Adil","lastName":"Bellabdaoui","id":"37085670448"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8571-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8572-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7731675","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731675","abstract":"This paper considers the full-truckload selective multi-depot vehicle routing problem under time windows constraints (denoted by FT-SMDVRPTW), which is a generalization of the vehicle routing problem (VRP).

Recently, technological solutions opted by many industries to optimize the performance of their information systems are based on Cloud Computing (CC). This emergent concept of IT services presents many advantages like lower cost and scalability. However, Cloud Computing is still in its infancy and needs to figure out several weaknesses before becoming the most valuable answer to the growing and diverse requirements of users. This paper strives to define the whole processes required to evaluate performance of a complex system like CC in order to improve the system performance. Firstly, we define the steps required to establish a performance analysis methodology. Secondly, we identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) by applying the principal of Balanced Scorecard (BSC) then we make use of the Taguchi experimental design to evaluate the influential factors of the studied system. Lastly, we will highlight how Cloud Computing should enhance the performance of a Supply Chain.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Logistics Operations Management (GOL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7601068/7731655/07731710.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Logistics Operations Management (GOL)","doi":"10.1109/GOL.2016.7731710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GOL.2016.7731710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A global performance analysis methodology: Case of cloud computing and logistics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Performance analysis","Logistics","Analytical models","Load modeling","Standards","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","costing","design of experiments","production engineering computing","supply chains","Taguchi methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global performance analysis methodology","cloud computing","logistics","business competition","performance optimization","quality-cost ratio","information systems","CC","IT services","key performance indicators","KPI","balanced scorecard principal","BSC","Taguchi experimental design","supply chain performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Performance Methodology","Key Performance Indicator","Balanced Scorecard","Taguchi","Logistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"A global performance analysis methodology: Case of cloud computing and logistics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7731710/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16447099","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A global performance analysis methodology: Case of cloud computing and logistics","confLoc":"Fez, Morocco","sourcePdf":"RagmaniCloudLogistics.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109347S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7601068","isNumber":"7731655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7601068","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7731655","articleId":"7731710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7731742,"authors":[{"name":"Anselo Gary Marko\u010d","affiliation":["Vipnet d.o.o., Croatia"],"firstName":"Anselo Gary","lastName":"Marko\u010d","id":"37085664125"},{"name":"Gordan \u0160i\u0161ul","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Croatia"],"firstName":"Gordan","lastName":"\u0160i\u0161ul","id":"37282479300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-184-221-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1734-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"7731742","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Optimization","Real-time systems","Market research","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","code division multiple access","radio networks","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monitoring technique","WCDMA radio network controller","wideband code division multiple access","RNC","KPI","key performance indicator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WCDMA","Monitoring Techniques","Performance management statistic","General performance event handling","User equipment traffic recording"]}],"abstract":"In this paper primary goal was to explain basic monitoring techniques on wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) radio network controller (RNC).

The stable and low-phase-noise signal, which can be generated by an advanced opto-electronic oscillator (OEO), is distributed to remote antenna units over a passive optical network infrastructure by radio-over-fibre (RoF) technology. Besides the cost effectiveness, this solution can decrease the size and complexity of base-stations, the number of which will increase in 5G cellular networks due to a reduction in the cell size. This article also presents the key building block for such a RoF system, which is a high-stability OEO.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAR.2016.7731744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731733","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium ELMAR","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium ELMAR","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636713/7731733/07731744.pdf","endPage":"16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposal for distribution of a low-phase-noise oscillator signal in forthcoming fifth-generation mobile network by radio-over-fibre technology","doi":"10.1109/ELMAR.2016.7731744","startPage":"13","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Proposal for distribution of a low-phase-noise oscillator signal in forthcoming fifth-generation mobile network by radio-over-fibre technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731744/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16430621","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7731744/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposal for distribution of a low-phase-noise oscillator signal in forthcoming fifth-generation mobile network by radio-over-fibre technology","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"011_orig-research.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055642S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636713","isNumber":"7731733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636713","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7731733","articleId":"7731744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society Electronics in Marine - ELMAR","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7731760,"authors":[{"name":"Isidora Stankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Isidora","lastName":"Stankovi\u0107","id":"37085525016"},{"name":"Wei Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37555483600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-184-221-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1734-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"7731760","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731760","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gases","Image reconstruction","Discrete cosine transforms","Heuristic algorithms","Instruments","Compressed sensing","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","density measurement","ozone"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global ozone density data reconstruction","gradient-descent algorithm","ozone measurements instrument","information tracking","information collection","missing data reconstruction","compressive sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sensing","Ozone Data","Gradient algorithm","Reconstruction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ELMAR.2016.7731760","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636713/7731733/07731760.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium ELMAR","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium ELMAR","startPage":"85","endPage":"88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAR.2016.7731760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of global Ozone density data using a gradient-descent algorithm","abstract":"The Ozone density and its decrease in the atmosphere are one of the main concerns of nowadays.

The application of a CS algorithm based on the gradient-descent method for the Ozone density data reconstruction is presented in this paper.

Experimental results observed that a single CMYG-NIR mixed image can be separated into the RGB and MR images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16430569","htmlLink":"/document/7731788/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Visible and near-infrared image separation from CMYG color filter array based sensor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visible and near-infrared image separation from CMYG color filter array based sensor","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"055_orig-research.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044908S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636713","isNumber":"7731733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636713","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7731733","articleId":"7731788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society Electronics in Marine - ELMAR","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7731801,"authors":[{"name":"Yunsung Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, Erica, Korea"],"firstName":"Yunsung","lastName":"Choi","id":"37066439400"},{"name":"Jihyun Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, Erica, Korea"],"firstName":"Jihyun","lastName":"Shin","id":"38021578800"},{"name":"Dongwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, Erica, Korea"],"firstName":"Dongwoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279318900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-184-221-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1734-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"7731801","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731801","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Array signal processing","Estimation","Precoding","Optical fibers","MISO","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","precoding","radio transmitters","radiocommunication","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-forcing beamforming","secure outage performance","torch nodes","secure transmission","multiple-input single-output wiretap channels","MISO wiretap channels","legitimate transmitter","eavesdropper channel","ZFB precoder","secrecy outage probability","asymptotic analysis","channel estimation errors","sub-optimal threshold"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical Layer Security","Zero-forcing Beamforming","Outage Probability","Diversity Order","Torch Nodes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ELMAR.2016.7731801","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium ELMAR","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium ELMAR","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636713/7731733/07731801.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAR.2016.7731801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure outage performance of zero-forcing beamforming with \u201ctorch nodes\u201d","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel usage of zero-forcing beamforming (ZFB) for secure transmission in multiple-input single-output (MISO) wiretap channels. When using ZFB for secure transmission, the difficulty lies in the legitimate transmitter (Alice) hardly knowing the channel to eavesdroppers (Eves). The knowledge of the channel to Eves is essential when Alice builds a ZFB precoder that could eliminate the information leakage to Eves. To overcome this difficulty, this paper introduces a torch node that is assumed to be close to an Eve and helps Alice to estimate the channel to the Eve though the estimation is prone to errors. An exact secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the proposed ZFB with torch nodes as well as its asymptotic analysis is provided in this paper. Due to the channel estimation errors, a torch node is not always beneficial to reducing SOP. For a typical problem with a single Eve, a sub-optimal threshold that supports the usage of a torch node is provided in close-form. Numerical results show that the proposed ZFB with torch nodes significantly improves SOP.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731801/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16447501","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7731801/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Secure outage performance of zero-forcing beamforming with \u201ctorch nodes\u201d","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure outage performance of zero-forcing beamforming with \u201ctorch nodes\u201d","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"068_orig-research.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048889S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636713","isNumber":"7731733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636713","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7731733","articleId":"7731801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society Electronics in Marine - ELMAR","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7731832,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson Fabian Avila","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, HsinChu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Nelson Fabian","lastName":"Avila","id":"37085612402"},{"name":"Chia-Chi Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, HsinChu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chia-Chi","lastName":"Chu","id":"37277309200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8397-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8396-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8398-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7731832","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731832","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Nickel","Artificial neural networks","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","distributed power generation","multi-agent systems","power distribution control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed pinning droop control","isolated AC microgrids","reactive power sharing","isolated converter-fed microgrids","multiagent system","MAS control","secondary controller","power sharing","MATLAB","Simulink","Java agent development framework","JADE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microgrids (MG)","Droop Control","Autonomous Power Sharing","Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)","Distributed Control","pinning control","Java Agent Development Framework (JADE)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a distributed communication-based droop control mechanism for accurate active and reactive power sharing in isolated converter-fed micro-grids(MG).

Battery replacement is usually inconvenient to the user experience. Wireless power transfer (WPT) could be the solution for this problem. However, wearable medical devices have their intrinsic specifications that could be challenges to the WPT. Their structures should be concise for the wearable needs. Power efficiency should be made as high as possible for prolonging the user experience. Besides, more computing based algorithms embedded in these devices would require more power consumption. How to fulfill these specifications is the aim of this research work. This paper proposes a wireless power processing module that integrate AC-DC and multi- DC-DC power circuits together for wearable medical devices.

Presently, EV attracts the people interests to be developed and utilized as it fully uses the electric energy from the battery pack to drive the vehicle motor and operate the accessories due to reduction of carbon and greenhouse gases emissions. The commonly used battery in the market is the lithium-ion battery due to its better performance as compared to other batteries. However, lithium-ion battery has some drawbacks such as the overcharged cell has a risk of explosion, the undercharged cell eventually reduces the life cycle of the battery, and unbalanced charge in series battery gradually reduces overall charge capacity. A battery charge equalization controller is capable to enhance the battery's performance, life cycle and safety. In this paper, a charge equalization algorithm is proposed and implemented using a battery monitoring integrated circuit for monitoring and equalization of an 8-cell battery pack using bidirectional flyback DC-DC converter as the channel for charging and discharging of the battery cell. The proposed equalization method proves an effective and automated system to modularize the battery charge that improves the safety and life cycle of battery.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731846/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16447344","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7731846/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Lithium-ion battery charge equalization algorithm for electric vehicle applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lithium-ion battery charge equalization algorithm for electric vehicle applications","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"2016-IACC-0772.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090974S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636703","isNumber":"7731809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636703","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7731809","articleId":"7731846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7731849,"authors":[{"name":"Longfei Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Longfei","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085463858"},{"name":"Arif I.

In particular, to address the dynamic nature of the power grid protection, a stochastic budget allocation game is proposed to analyze the strategic interactions between a malicious attacker and the grid defender while factoring in the attack and defense budget limitations. In this game, the attacker intends to maximize the physical impacts of coordinated attacks on the grid while the defender aims to minimize these impacts. An optimal load shedding problem is formulated to measure such physical impacts under successful attacks, and these impacts are then incorporated into a learning algorithm as inputs for finding the Nash equilibrium of the game. The two players' optimal strategies at Nash equilibrium, in terms of attacking/protecting the critical grid elements, can be used to assess the risk faced by the grid at various states. In addition, the optimal defense budget allocation strategy is expressed in terms of the corresponding risk. The proposed stochastic game framework is tested on the IEEE 9-bus system for illustrative purpose, and risk sensitivity to the attack/defense budget variation is analyzed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731809","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636703/7731809/07731849.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2016.7731849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2016.7731849","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Risk assessment of coordinated cyber-physical attacks against power grids: A stochastic game approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731849/","displayDocTitle":"Risk assessment of coordinated cyber-physical attacks against power grids: A stochastic game approach","htmlLink":"/document/7731849/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16447486","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk assessment of coordinated cyber-physical attacks against power grids: A stochastic game approach","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"2016-IACC-0776.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093771S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636703","isNumber":"7731809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636703","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7731809","articleId":"7731849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7731850,"authors":[{"name":"Raja Sekhara Reddy Chilipi","affiliation":["Petroleum Institute, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Raja Sekhara Reddy","lastName":"Chilipi","id":"37085812813"},{"name":"Naji Al Sayari","affiliation":["The Petroleum Institute, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Naji","lastName":"Al Sayari","id":"37085811498"},{"name":"Khalifa Al Hosani","affiliation":["The Petroleum Institute, Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Khalifa","lastName":"Al Hosani","id":"38339869500"},{"name":"Abul R.

The DG inverter in this study consists of three single-phase voltage source inverters with common dc bus and coupled to utility grid via three single-phase transformers. The DG sources are represented as constant dc voltage source on its dc side.

The proposed approach focuses on the sensorless control of electrical drives in which the sample rate of the control task is chosen slower than both the maximum possible update rate of the phase voltages and the maximum possible sample rate of the phase current measurement by a multiple. Under those conditions it is possible to inject multiple-frequency carrier signals between two successive control sampling instances without affecting the control. Furthermore, a combined demodulation of these signals is enabled by exploiting the constant manipulated variables of the field-oriented control system during the injection sequence. With the proposed method the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the calculated rotor position as well as the acoustic noise produced by signal injections can be optimized. The approach is implemented in a field-oriented control for permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM) and is verified in experiments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency measurement","Control systems","Reliability","Pulse width modulation","Process control","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","demodulation","electric drives","least squares approximations","machine vector control","permanent magnet machines","rotors","sensorless machine control","synchronous machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation approach","slowly sampled sensorless field-oriented control system","least square method","saliency based position estimation","electrical drive sensorless control","phase current measurement sample rate","multiple-frequency carrier signal Injection","successive control sampling","rotor position signal-to-noise-ratio","SNR","acoustic noise","permanent magnet synchronous machine","PMSM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self-Sensing","Sensorless Control","Permanent magnet machines","Carrier Signal Injection","Multiple-Frequency Injection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.2016.7731861","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636703/7731809/07731861.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2016.7731861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demodulation approach for slowly sampled sensorless field-oriented control systems enabling multiple-frequency injections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Demodulation approach for slowly sampled sensorless field-oriented control systems enabling multiple-frequency injections","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731861/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7731861/","accessionNumber":"16447369","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demodulation approach for slowly sampled sensorless field-oriented control systems enabling multiple-frequency injections","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"2016-IACC-0788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06075S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636703","isNumber":"7731809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636703","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7731809","articleId":"7731861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7731865,"authors":[{"name":"Lokman H.

This paper considers solar photovoltaic (PV) systems as the RES whereas a diesel generator equipped with a rectifier is used as a backup supply to maintain the continuity of power supply in the case of emergency situations. The controller is designed recursively based on the Lyapunov control theory where all parameters within the model of BESSs are assumed to be unknown. These unknown parameters are then estimated through the adaptation laws and whose stability is ensured by formulating suitable control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) at different stages of the design process. Moreover, a scheme is also presented to monitor the state of charge (SOC) of the BESS. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is verified on a test DC microgrid under various operating conditions. The proposed controller ensures the DC bus voltage regulation within the acceptable limits under different operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2016.7731875","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636703/7731809/07731875.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2016.7731875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731809","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear adaptive backstepping controller design for controlling bidirectional power flow of BESSs in DC microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear adaptive backstepping controller design for controlling bidirectional power flow of BESSs in DC microgrids","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731875/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16447478","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7731875/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear adaptive backstepping controller design for controlling bidirectional power flow of BESSs in DC microgrids","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"2016-IACC-0802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096501S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636703","isNumber":"7731809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636703","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7731809","articleId":"7731875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7731898,"authors":[{"name":"Zivion O.

The analysis is based upon a laboratory-controlled ageing experiment over 17 LED lamps samples. Each sample is put into its normal operating condition up to 20000 hours. As a comparison, lumen maintenance tests are also performed over another set of 9 lamps. In order to analyze the change in characteristics, the photometric and color quantities of the lamps are evaluated. The results show that the blue peak value and the re-emitted yellow component are decreasing independently over time. This implies that the ageing process induces a change of the color temperature and of the color rendering index of the output light. Four mathematical models are also proposed to investigate the relationship between color output and the operational time of the lamp. The selection of the best fitting is based upon the coefficients of determination from each model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phosphors","Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colorimetry","LED lamps","photometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing characterization","photometric properties","colorimetric properties","commercial LED lamps","spectral-derived characteristics","lumen maintenance tests","color quantity","color temperature","color rendering index","mathematical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aging","Color measurement","Light-emitting Diodes","Lighting","Phosphor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.2016.7731898","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636703/7731809/07731898.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2016.7731898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ageing characterization of colorimetric and photometric properties of commercial LED lamps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7731898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ageing characterization of colorimetric and photometric properties of commercial LED lamps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731898/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7731898/","accessionNumber":"16447450","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ageing characterization of colorimetric and photometric properties of commercial LED lamps","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"2016-ILDC-0615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057787S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636703","isNumber":"7731809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636703","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7731809","articleId":"7731898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7731963,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7636703/7731809/7731963/7731963-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaodong Liang (M\u201806\u2014SM\u201909) was born in Lingyuan, China.

In this paper, a rule-based data-driven analytics method for wide-area fault detection in a power system using synchrophasor data is proposed. As a data-driven approach, this method relies on rules created using PMU measurement data, and does not require knowledge of the power system's topology and model. It can detect fault location (bus and line) and fault type for a particular fault event. Three common types of short circuit faults in a power grid, single-line-to-ground (SLG), line-to-line (LL), and three phase faults, can be identified using the proposed method. Fault thresholds used in rules are determined based on theoretical values and recorded PMU data during fault events in Bonneville Power Administration (BPA)'s large power grid. The proposed method is validated by comparing with the recorded field data for fault events provided by BPA. It is found that it can effectively detect most faults with a great accuracy. It has been developed into a software program, and can be readily used by utility companies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2016.7731963","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636703/7731809/07731963.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2016.7731963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rule-based data-driven analytics for Wide-Area fault detection using synchrophasor data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Rule-based data-driven analytics for Wide-Area fault detection using synchrophasor data","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7731963/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16447403","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731963/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rule-based data-driven analytics for Wide-Area fault detection using synchrophasor data","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"2016-PSEC-0688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09313S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636703","isNumber":"7731809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636703","xplore-issue":"7731809","articleId":"7731963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7731965,"authors":[{"name":"Fangzhou Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Fangzhou","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085701211"},{"name":"Yayu Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Yayu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085718631"},{"name":"Liyan Qu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"lastName":"Liyan Qu","id":"37087683022"},{"name":"Wei Qiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37545084000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8397-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8396-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8398-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7731965","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current-based fault detection and identification for wind turbine drivetrain gearboxes","abstract":"This paper proposes a new fault detection and identification framework for drivetrain gearboxes of wind turbines equipped with doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) based on the fusion of DFIG stator and rotor current signals.

Circulating current suppressing strategies based on proportional resonant (PR) controllers are widely used in MMC. This kind of strategies can effectively eliminate all the circulating current components in MMC-HVDC. Unfortunately, it can result in dc-line voltage ripples under unbalanced grid conditions and thus deteriorates system performance and stability. Moreover, its existing control model may not exactly reveal the inherent characteristic of MMC and consequently blocks the further understanding and application. To solve these two problems, firstly, this paper builds a new and effective control model for this strategy. Secondly, based on the new model, this paper studies the relationship between circulating current reference value and submodule (SM) capacitor voltage, modulation index and arm current to correct and improve the current understanding of this control strategy. Lastly, three improved strategies based on PR controllers are proposed. These improved control strategies can eliminate both circulating current and dc-line voltage ripples, which greatly enhance the fault ride-through capability of MMC-HVDC without adding extra control cost or the number of controllers.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636703/7731809/07731968.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2016.7731968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2016.7731968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7731809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circulating current suppression for MMC-HVDC under unbalanced grid conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7731968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Circulating current suppression for MMC-HVDC under unbalanced grid conditions","htmlLink":"/document/7731968/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16447364","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circulating current suppression for MMC-HVDC under unbalanced grid conditions","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"2016-PSEC-0693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092837S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636703","isNumber":"7731809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636703","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7731809","articleId":"7731968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732007,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Liang","affiliation":["North China Electric Power University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Liang"},{"name":"Xiongwen Zhao","affiliation":["North China Electric Power University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xiongwen","lastName":"Zhao"},{"name":"Shu Li","affiliation":["North China Electric Power University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Qi Wang","affiliation":["North China Electric Power University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Wenbing Lu","affiliation":["North China Electric Power University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wenbing","lastName":"Lu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"7732007","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Mobile communication","Wideband","Delays","Scattering","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","geometry","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D geometry-based scattering model","three-dimensional geometry-based stochastic scattering model","GBSSM","wideband MIMO V2V relay-based cooperative fading channel","nonline-of-sight propagation condition","amplify-and-forward cooperative networks","NLOS","AF cooperative networks","source mobile station","destination mobile station","mobile relay station","channel matrix","wideband multi-input multi-output vehicle-to-vehicle relay","cooperative channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["geometry-based scattering model","MIMO","relay-based cooperative communication","vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)","wideband"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) geometry-based stochastic scattering model (GBSSM) for wideband multi-input multi-output (MIMO) vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) relay-based cooperative fading channel based on geometrical three-cylinder is proposed.

By using the realized channel matrix, the channel properties are further investigated.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2016.7732007","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7732002/07732007.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2016.7732007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732002","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3D geometry-based scattering model for vehicle-to-vehicle wideband MIMO relay-based cooperative channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 3D geometry-based scattering model for vehicle-to-vehicle wideband MIMO relay-based cooperative channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732007/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443071","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3D geometry-based scattering model for vehicle-to-vehicle wideband MIMO relay-based cooperative channels","sourcePdf":"1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057767S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","isNumber":"7732002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"7","articleId":"7732007","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732008,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang-Sy Nguyen","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Group, Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Hoang-Sy","lastName":"Nguyen"},{"name":"Anh-Hoa Bui","affiliation":["Eastern International University, Binh Duong Province, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Anh-Hoa","lastName":"Bui"},{"name":"Dinh-Thuan Do","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Group, Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Dinh-Thuan","lastName":"Do"},{"name":"Miroslav Voznak","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Group, Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Technical University of Ostrava, 17.

Especially, we reveal the analytical expressions of achievable throughput, ergodic capacity and energy-efficient in case of imperfect channel state information (CSI) for both AF and DF network. Through numerical analysis, we analyse the throughput performance, energy-efficient and ergodic capacity for different parameters, including power splitting ratio and energy harvesting time. Moreover, we also depict the performance comparison between AF and DF network with perfect and imperfect CSI.

network infrastructures for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurement are used. Our approach to localize the mobile node is based on the relative change in the RSSI values obtained from BLE network, provided the knowledge of certain area specific information. The main advantage of this approach is that even the large environmental changes in the working area creates very less effect on the localization results. A new RSSI smoothing algorithm is proposed in such a way that it reduces the effect of sudden environmental changes on RSSI values. We have also formulated an integer optimization problem, where path loss exponent is optimized subject to a given area specific information. Since this problem is Non-deterministic Polynomial-time Hard (NP-Hard), we have presented sub-optimal solution to this problem, which are far better than the state-of-the-art approaches presented in the literature. Our proposed approaches provide an accuracy of average error in distance of 1.162 meter.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732017","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732017.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cost-effective solution for pedestrian localization in complex indoor environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732017/","displayDocTitle":"A cost-effective solution for pedestrian localization in complex indoor environment","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429950","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732017/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cost-effective solution for pedestrian localization in complex indoor environment","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP0031570282583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064756S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732030,"authors":[{"name":"Yash M.

Moderate PLI can mask the finer features of the underlying signal whereas severe interference can completely overwhelm it. The techniques for PLI removal proposed in the literature are mostly based on fixed notch and adaptive filters. The fixed notch filters perform poorly in case of PLI frequency variations, whereas adaptive filters suffer from issues such as slow convergence and requirement of an external reference signal. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for PLI removal from the ECG signal which overcomes the limitations of both fixed and adaptive filters. We model the PLI as an AM-FM component and use wavelet transform (WT) based component retrieval technique that is inspired by the synchrosqueezing framework to retrieve the PLI component, which is subtracted from the contaminated signal to remove the interference. The proposed method is evaluated in two worst-case scenarios of PLI frequency and amplitude variation, for healthy and pathological cases and the simulation results show significantly better performance of the proposed method over fixed and adaptive filtering techniques, as quantified by the performance indices.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732031","endPage":"101","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732031.pdf","startPage":"95","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power line interference removal from ECG signals using wavelet transform based component-retrieval","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732031/","displayDocTitle":"Power line interference removal from ECG signals using wavelet transform based component-retrieval","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429858","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732031/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power line interference removal from ECG signals using wavelet transform based component-retrieval","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP0171570282493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058766S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732032,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Firstly, Motion History Images (MHI) are generated from RGB videos which represent the temporal information about the action. Then the original depth data is rotated in 3D point clouds and three Depth Motion Maps (DMM) are generated over the entire depth sequence corresponding to the front, side and top projection views. A 4 Channel Deep Convolutional Neural Network is trained, where the first channel is for classifying MHIs and the remaining three for the front, side and top view generated from depth data respectively. The proposed method is evaluated on publically available UTD-MHAD dataset which contains both RGB and depth videos. Experimental results show that combining two modalities gives better recognition accuracy than using each modality individually.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732038","startPage":"144","endPage":"148","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732038.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human action recognition using RGB-D sensor and deep convolutional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732038/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Human action recognition using RGB-D sensor and deep convolutional neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732038/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16429849","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human action recognition using RGB-D sensor and deep convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP0241570277790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056944S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7732052,"authors":[{"name":"Smrity Ratan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, BHU, Varanasi"],"firstName":"Smrity","lastName":"Ratan","id":"37085903050"},{"name":"Debalina Mondal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Comm.

If Signal strength at the receiving antenna is very weak then there must be required a device that increase the strength of the received signal (power), known as Amplifier.

This is why the designing of amplifiers is crucial in analog circuit designing.

The severity of the problem further increases when the plant's mathematical model is unknown or partially known which makes the use of PID control more difficult because it requires the dynamics of the system for tuning its parameters. Even if the dynamics are known, the parameters of PID controller are required to be retuned when external disturbance signals and/or parameter variations occurs in the system. In this paper, the PID controller is implemented using a multilayer feed forward neural network (MLFFNN) for the desired trajectory tracking control of one-link robotic manipulator (plant). To make the controller adaptive, the dynamics of plant is assumed to be unknown and hence, a separate multilayer feed forward neural network identification model is used which will approximate the plant's dynamics and operate simultaneously with the controller. The other benefits of using an identification model is that it can adjust its own parameters to reflect the effects of the disturbance signal and parameter variations on the system and provides this information to the controller which then makes necessary adjustment to its output to compensate these effects. Simulation results shows that MLFFNN based PID controller is able to control the plant and provides the desired trajectory in the presence of parameter variations and disturbance signal.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732054","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732054.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"249","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and control of one-link robotic manipulator using neural network based PID controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and control of one-link robotic manipulator using neural network based PID controller","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16429831","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732054/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and control of one-link robotic manipulator using neural network based PID controller","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP0401570277042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084135S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7732056,"authors":[{"name":"Shravan Kumar Bandari","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Warangal, India"],"firstName":"Shravan Kumar","lastName":"Bandari","id":"37085802683"},{"name":"V.

One of the contenders for 5G, Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM), seems to serve the next generation wireless needs due to its attractive properties when compared to the existing cyclic prefix orthogonal FDM (CP-OFDM). Nevertheless, due to the inherent non-orthogonal nature of the scheme, GFDM may introduce intersymbol and intercarrier interference (ISI/ICI). For better spectral efficient transmission with improved orthogonality, we explored in this article the well known Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OQAM) multicarrier signaling technique as applied to the GFDM system. In particular we investigated the GFDM/OQAM system model under Rician-K fading channel conditions providing the corresponding analytical expressions. The model performance is evaluated in terms of the Symbol Error Rate (SER) and the results are seen to improve upon conventional GFDM.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732056","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732056.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GFDM/OQAM implementation under Rician fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732056/","displayDocTitle":"GFDM/OQAM implementation under Rician fading channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429729","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732056/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GFDM/OQAM implementation under Rician fading channel","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP0421570280196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043567S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732058,"authors":[{"name":"Anindita Chakraborty","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Anindita","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37085885820"},{"name":"Aparna Dhara","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Aparna","lastName":"Dhara","id":"37085884028"},{"name":"Hafizur Rahaman","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Hafizur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37085592218"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732058","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732058","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Radiation detectors","Flip-flops","Logic gates","Clocks","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["counting circuits","flip-flops","integrated circuit design","memristor circuits","nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristor-based up-down counter","material implication logic","nanodevice","nanoelectronic circuit","memory designs","memristor-based T flip-flop","toggle flip-flop","memristor technology","counter design","CMOS-based design","memristor-based counter circuit","logic states"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["T flip-flop","Up-Down counter","imply logic","memristor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732058","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732058.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of memristor-based up-down counter using material implication logic","abstract":"`Memristor' is a new emerging nanodevice that is gaining a lot of appreciation from the researchers these days. They possess dual properties of resistor, memory and find immense application in the fields of nanoelectronic circuit and memory designs. Material implication logic is applied in memristor-based circuit designs as it can be performed easily using two memristors and one resistor. In this paper a memristor-based T (toggle) flip-flop is implemented using material implication logic. Thereby this T flip-flop is employed in designing an Up-Down counter, based on the implication operations using memristors. The designs thus presented for the T flip-flop and counter need 6, 16 memristors respectively. Memristor technology being highly dense, our counter design will occupy lesser area as compared to its conventional CMOS-based design. Also the proposed T flip flop takes 11 computation steps to generate its outputs and 52 steps are needed by the Up-Down counter to perform its operation. Moreover in our memristor-based counter circuit, counting can be started, stopped and resumed at any desired logic states by simply controlling the externally applied voltages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732058/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16429925","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of memristor-based up-down counter using material implication logic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of memristor-based up-down counter using material implication logic","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP0441570282983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095133S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7732089,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Krishna Kondoju","affiliation":["Department of ECE, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India"],"firstName":"Sai Krishna","lastName":"Kondoju","id":"37085580181"},{"name":"V.

However, the high out-of-band leakage in OFDM systems has the tendency to interference with primary users operating in adjacent bands. In order to protect neighboring systems, sidelobe leakage needs to be restricted below the prescribed mask. There are various well-known techniques in the literature for sidelobe suppression. In particular, the least-squares notching precoder (LSNP) based on projection matrix is computationally very effective and has good sidelobe suppression. However, it invariably introduces distortion on each subcarrier thereby degrading the system's error-rate performance. Existing solutions for enhancing error performance are either computationally expensive or degrade throughput of the system. In this paper, we proposed a novel decoding technique which significantly improves error-rate performance without affecting the throughput of the system. In addition to that, the proposed scheme when joined with the existing iterative recovery algorithm further improves the performance and requires as few as one iteration to achieve minimum bit-error-rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732090.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"477","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel decoding technique for least-squares notching precoder in OFDM cognitive radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","OFDM","Decoding","Distortion","Iterative decoding","Interference","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decoding","error statistics","iterative methods","least squares approximations","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding technique","least-squares notching precoder","LSNP","cognitive radio systems","out-of-band leakage","OFDM systems","primary users","sidelobe leakage","sidelobe suppression","projection matrix","iterative recovery algorithm","bit-error-rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel decoding technique for least-squares notching precoder in OFDM cognitive radio","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732090/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429675","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel decoding technique for least-squares notching precoder in OFDM cognitive radio","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP0761570282827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056106S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732114,"authors":[{"name":"Pampa Howladar","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology"],"firstName":"Pampa","lastName":"Howladar","id":"37061774500"},{"name":"Debashri Roy","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, USA","Department of Computer Science"],"firstName":"Debashri","lastName":"Roy","id":"37085896751"},{"name":"Pranab Roy","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology"],"firstName":"Pranab","lastName":"Roy","id":"37958578500"},{"name":"Hafizur Rahaman","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Hafizur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37284440200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732114","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"abstract":"Droplet based digital microfluidics is a popular emerging technology for laboratory experiments. However, certain limitations exist in specific cases for implementation that require further enhancement. Pin-count minimization and cross- contamination avoidance between droplets of different biomolecules during droplet routing are primary design challenges for biochips. A competent architecture namely Microelectrode Dot Array (MEDA) has recently been introduced as a new highly scalable, field programmable and reconfigurable dot array architecture which allows dynamic configuration. This work considers the cross contamination problems in pin constrained biochips based on MEDA architecture. In order to reduce the cross-contamination problem, in this work we present a MEDA architecture based cross-reference driving scheme that allows simultaneous driving of multiple droplets and thereby propose a suitable net placement technique applicable for MEDA architecture. The objectives of this proposed technique include reducing the crossovers with intelligent collision avoidance, minimizing the overall routing time and increasing grouping number to reduce the total pin-count. Simulation results thus presented in this paper indicate the efficiency of our algorithm for practical bioassays.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732114.pdf","startPage":"614","endPage":"619","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-reference EWOD driving scheme and cross-contamination aware net placement technique for MEDA based DMFBs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Routing","Pins","Microfluidics","Microelectrodes","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","drops","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-reference EWOD driving scheme","electrowetting-on-dielectrics","cross-contamination aware net placement technique","MEDA based DMFB","droplet-based digital microfluidic biochip","droplet based digital microfluidics","laboratory experiment","pin-count minimization","cross-contamination avoidance","biomolecule","droplet routing","microelectrode dot array","dot array architecture","MEDA architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital microfluidics","MEDA","EWOD","Droplet routing","Pin constrained design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Cross-reference EWOD driving scheme and cross-contamination aware net placement technique for MEDA based DMFBs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732114/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429877","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-reference EWOD driving scheme and cross-contamination aware net placement technique for MEDA based DMFBs","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP1001570300101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064096S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732128,"authors":[{"name":"Veena Mayya","affiliation":["Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal University, Manipal, India"],"firstName":"Veena","lastName":"Mayya","id":"37085900047"},{"name":"Radhika M.

Undecimated dual tree complex wavelet transform possesses certain advantages over the traditional wavelet transforms and hence it is capable of representing digital image signals more accurately. We have explored this concept considering the face recognition problem. Given a face image we compute the complex UDTCWT coefficient images of the face image at 4 scales and 6 orientations. Using these coefficient images we compute 48 Local UDTCWT Phase Patterns (LUPPs) and 8 Global UDTCWT Phase Patterns (GUPPs). Dividing these patterns into blocks and concatenating the 2D magnitude weighted phase histogram of the complex coefficients in these blocks, we form our Global descriptor. To handle pose and expression variation in face images, we have developed a key point based local descriptor. Given a face image, using the box filter response scale space, we have obtained scale dependent size square regions around interest points and these square regions are represented using UDTCWT. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark face recognition datasets FERET, ORL, YALE and UMIST have demonstrated the appropriateness of our descriptors for face recognition applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732132","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732132.pdf","startPage":"720","endPage":"726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Undecimated dual tree complex wavelet transform based face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732132/","displayDocTitle":"Undecimated dual tree complex wavelet transform based face recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444532","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732132/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Undecimated dual tree complex wavelet transform based face recognition","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP1181570285067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050773S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732135,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Rathee","affiliation":["School of Computing and Electrical Engineering I.I.T.

Association rule mining is one of the best methods for this purpose. Finding possible associations between items in large transaction based datasets (finding frequent patterns) is most important part of the association rule mining. There exists many algorithms to find frequent patterns but Apriori algorithm always remains a preferred choice due to its ease of implementation and natural tendency to be parallelized. Many single-machine based Apriori variants exist but massive amount of data available these days is above capacity of a single machine. Therefore, to meet the demands of this ever-growing huge data, there is a need of multiple machines based Apriori algorithm. For these type of distributed applications, mapreduce is a popular fault-tolerant framework. Hadoop is one of the best open-source software framework with mapreduce approach for distributed storage and distributed processing of huge datasets using clusters built from commodity hardware. But heavy disk I/O operation at each iteration of a highly iterative algorithm like Apriori makes hadoop inefficient. A number of map reduce based platforms are being developed for parallel computing in recent years. Among them, two platforms, namely, Spark and Flink have attracted lot of attention because of their inbuilt support to distributed computations. Earlier we had proposed a reduced-Apriori algorithm on Spark platform which outperforms parallel Apriori, firstly because of use of Spark and secondly because of the improvement we proposed in standard Apriori. Therefore, present work is a natural sequel of our earlier work and targets on implementing, testing and benchmarking Apriori on Apache Flink and compares it with Spark implementation. We conduct in-depth experiments to gain insight into the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of the Apriori algorithm on Flink. We also use community detection graph mining problem as a test case to demonstrate our implementations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Itemsets","Algorithm design and analysis","Sparks","Data mining","Clustering algorithms","Iterative methods","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Apache Flink iteration capabilities","community detection problem","large datasets","association rule mining","large transaction based datasets","Apriori algorithm","single-machine based Apriori variants","fault-tolerant framework","Hadoop","open source software framework","mapreduce","distributed storage","distributed processing","commodity hardware","heavy disk I/O operation","distributed computations","Spark platform","community detection graph mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Apriori","Apache Flink","Mapreduce","Spark","Hadoop","R-Apriori","Frequent itemset mining"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732135","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732135.pdf","startPage":"739","endPage":"745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Apache Flink's iteration capabilities for distributed Apriori: Community detection problem as an example","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Apache Flink's iteration capabilities for distributed Apriori: Community detection problem as an example","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732135/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732135/","accessionNumber":"16429850","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Apache Flink's iteration capabilities for distributed Apriori: Community detection problem as an example","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP1211570288939.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070523S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7732155,"authors":[{"name":"Sushil Kumar","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, GGSIPU University, New Delhi"],"firstName":"Sushil","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085892610"},{"name":"Rohit Aid","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, MMU, Mullana, Ambala"],"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Aid","id":"37085892359"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732155","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732155","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Chaotic communication","Real-time systems","Standards","Correlation coefficient","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","image processing","neural nets","private key cryptography","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image encryption","wavelet based chaotic neural network","WCNN","chaotic sequence","1D logistic map","private key system","data compression"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732155","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732155.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","startPage":"875","endPage":"879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image encryption using wavelet based chaotic neural network","abstract":"The present work proposes the implementation of Wavelet based Chaotic Neural Network (WCNN) for image encryption.

Depending on a human tester to evaluate program behaviour has also some problems such as cost and correctness.

According to the conventional Shannon-Nyquist sampling theory, the signal has to sample twice the bandwidth in order to have the proper reconstruction. It is required to store a large amount of data according to the conventional method. CS helps to resolve this issue with two important parameters such as the measurement matrix and the basis matrix. They should satisfy two properties which are Restricted Isometric Property (RIP) and Independent and Identically Distributed (IID). There are various reconstruction algorithms which are useful for the proper recovery of the signal after applying the CS technique. The work is carried out on different types of audible signals which are non-stationary in the nature. For the single tone audio signal, the value of SNR is quiet good. Whereas the SNR value of the music signal and the instrumental signal has been degraded because of the single tone frequency component. The value of RIP constant varies with the change in number of measurements.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732203","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732203.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","startPage":"1172","endPage":"1176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of compressive sensing for non stationary music signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of compressive sensing for non stationary music signal","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732203/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444583","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732203/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of compressive sensing for non stationary music signal","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP1891570289770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066117S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7732205,"authors":[{"name":"Surbhi Chhabra","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, The LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur, Raj., India"],"firstName":"Surbhi","lastName":"Chhabra","id":"37085891690"},{"name":"Himanshu Jain","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, The LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur, Raj., India"],"firstName":"Himanshu","lastName":"Jain","id":"37085884472"},{"name":"Sandeep Saini","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, The LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur, Raj., India"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Saini","id":"37396289300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732205","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":493},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Image edge detection","Licenses","Hardware","MATLAB","Field programmable gate arrays","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","object detection","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal FPGA-based hardware implementation","automatic vehicle license plate detection system","AVLPDS","vehicle license plate information extraction","electronic payment systems","arterial monitoring systems","traffic surveillance","FPGA algorithmic model","edge-based algorithm","connected-component based algorithm","histogram based algorithm","precision rate","recall rate","histogram based edge processing approach","MATLAB Simulink","Xilinx System Generator","XSG","image processing","hardware cosimulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Vehicle License Plate Detection System","MATLAB Simulink","Xilinx System generator","VIVADO HLS","FPGA","ZedBoard","image processing"]}],"abstract":"Automatic Vehicle License Plate Detection System (AVLPDS) is the extraction of vehicle license plate information from an image.

The whole system is implemented using MATLAB Simulink and Xilinx System Generator(XSG). Use of XSG for image processing effectively reduces the complexity in structural design and contributes for hardware co-simulation.

Moreover, a range of assumptions are made so as to differentiate between normal and deviated data instances. This paper describes a solution approach to this problem using a two-step phase including an important preprocessing phase and anomaly detection phase. For the preprocessing phase, we have used two methods mainly: Recursive Feature Elimination method (RFE) and Random Forest Ensemble (RF-Ensemble) method. For the next phase of anomaly detection, we have used Clustering based Oversampling PCA (os-PCA) methodology. The k-median clustering approach is utilized for this purpose. The technique was implemented and tested on various standard data sets like Pima, Splice etc. The results were also compared with the existing state of the methods in this field like online Oversampling PCA, Naive Oversampling PCA, decremental PCA, Local Outlier Factor, Angle Based Outlier detection and Median Based Outlier Detection approaches. The testing results confirm that the proposed approach outperformed all other methods on the basis of accuracy, AUC scores etc.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732226","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732226.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","startPage":"1298","endPage":"1304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attribute reduction based anomaly detection scheme by clustering dependent oversampling PCA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Attribute reduction based anomaly detection scheme by clustering dependent oversampling PCA","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732226/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429700","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732226/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attribute reduction based anomaly detection scheme by clustering dependent oversampling PCA","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP2121570291353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105496S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732231,"authors":[{"name":"Pallavi Nag","affiliation":["Department of electronics and communication Chandigarh University, Gharuan"],"firstName":"Pallavi","lastName":"Nag","id":"37085907022"},{"name":"Amit Gupta","affiliation":["Department of electronics and communication Chandigarh University, Gharuan"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085541113"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732231","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Integrated optics","Wireless communication","MIMO","Optical imaging","Bit error rate","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","image processing","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vignetting effect reduction","MIMO optical wireless system","channel BER reduction","OWC system","pixelated system","ICI","spatial orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","SACO-OFDM","SDCO-OFDM","spatial asymmetrical clipped optical","spatial DC-biased clipped optical","MATLAB simulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","SACO-OFDM","SDCO-OFDM","vignetting","Pixelated Imaging"]}],"abstract":"Vignetting is the process in which there is darkness at the edges as compared to center of image. Thus the process of vignetting can affect the performance of MIMO optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. The effect of the vignetting on a pixelated system is measured by using spatial OFDM. It is clear that vignetting can leads to the attenuation and ICI in the spatial orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. SACO-OFDM (spatial asymmetrical clipped optical) and SDCO-OFDM (spatial DC-biased clipped optical) are previous techniques which are used to reduce the impact of vignetting on signals. This paper investigates the result of vignetting on pixelated MIMO systems with OFDM. In this work, we reduce the effect of vignetting by reducing BER of channel using MATLAB simulator. After simulation it is proved that the proposed technique shows better accuracy than previous techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732231","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduce the effect of vignetting on MIMO optical wireless system by reducing BER of channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduce the effect of vignetting on MIMO optical wireless system by reducing BER of channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732231/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429907","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732231/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduce the effect of vignetting on MIMO optical wireless system by reducing BER of channel","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP2171570297190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049156S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732241,"authors":[{"name":"Richa","affiliation":["University of Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi, IN"],"lastName":"Richa"},{"name":"Punam Bedi","affiliation":["University of Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi, IN"],"firstName":"Punam","lastName":"Bedi"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732241","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Context","Recommender systems","Collaboration","Java","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative filtering","Java","parallel processing","recommender systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel context aware CF recommender system","GPU","JCuda","RS","collaborative filtering approach","PCARS","graphic processing unit","Java technologies","contextual pre-filtering","context post-filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recommender Systems","Context Aware","Parallel Processing"]}],"abstract":"Recommender Systems (RS) are intelligent applications which predict the preferences for users from their current interests. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely used Recommendation technique. On large scale data, collaborative filtering approach is very time consuming and hence parallel processing can be useful for accelerating the task of recommendation. Context Aware Recommender Systems (CARS) help us to generate precise and relevant recommendations by using specific context of the user. This paper presents Parallel Context Aware CF Recommender Systems using JCuda (PCARS) that involves Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). The proposed algorithm works in two phases: offline and online processing. Two kernels are identified and processed for offline processing which reduce the processing time drastically. Online processing involves with the prediction calculation for the items which is not yet seen by target user and can be recommended to them. Offloading the prediction calculation to GPU will help to increase the overall system performance significantly. A prototype of the proposed system is developed using JCuda, CUDA and Java technologies for the restaurant domain. The performance of the proposed system PCARS is compared to the Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems (CFRS) without parallel processing using contextual pre-filtering and context post-filtering in terms of processing time. Experimental results demonstrated the tremendous speedup of the system over a single-core CPU based system.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732241","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732241.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","startPage":"1383","endPage":"1389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel context aware recommender system using GPU and JCuda","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel context aware recommender system using GPU and JCuda","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732241/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429784","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732241/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel context aware recommender system using GPU and JCuda","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP2271570293398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072629S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732248,"authors":[{"name":"Kruti Nargund","affiliation":["Department of ISE, PESIT, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Kruti","lastName":"Nargund","id":"37085902578"},{"name":"S.

To reap its full benefits, much research is required across a broad array of topics. One of the important research issues which need to be focused for its efficient performance is scheduling. The goal of scheduling is to map the job to resources that optimize more than one objectives. Scheduling in cloud computing belongs to a category of problems known as NP-hard problem due to large solution space and thus it takes long time to find an optimal solution. In cloud environment, it is best to find suboptimal solution, but in short period of time. Metaheuristic based techniques have been proved to achieve near optimal solutions within reasonable time for such problems. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey on optimization algorithms for cloud environments based on three popular metaheuristic techniques: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a novel technique: League Championship Algorithm (LCA).","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732249.pdf","startPage":"1434","endPage":"1440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survey on meta heuristic optimization techniques in cloud computing","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Survey on meta heuristic optimization techniques in cloud computing","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429934","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732249/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey on meta heuristic optimization techniques in cloud computing","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP2351570293301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079674S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732251,"authors":[{"name":"Anuja Rawat","affiliation":["Computer Science Engineering, GBPEC, Pauri Garhwal, India"],"firstName":"Anuja","lastName":"Rawat","id":"37085891144"},{"name":"Shashi Kant Verma","affiliation":["Computer Science Engineering, GBPEC, Pauri Garhwal, India"],"firstName":"Shashi Kant","lastName":"Verma","id":"37085886191"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732251","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732251","abstract":"Increasing demand for bandwidth usage has highlighted the spectrum utilization challenges for wireless sensor networks. Recent advancements in the area of wireless communication have introduced cognitive radio technology in wireless sensor network in order to overcome the spectrum scarcity problem. Cognitive wireless sensor networks, coexisting with wireless sensor networks are also dependent on limited energy resources. Besides typical sensing tasks; spectrum sensing and hand off along with bursty traffic demand extra energy of sensor nodes. Efficient energy utilization is one of the major concerns for these networks. In this paper, Fan Access Protocol (FAP) is introduced for cognitive network. This protocol effectively minimizes energy consumption and thus prolongs network lifetime using multi-hop routing based on optimal shortest path. Simulation results show that FAP performs better in terms of energy utilization and prolonging lifetime of network as compared to Fan-Shaped Clustering (FSC). A theoretical model for cognitive sensor network is also presented which uses coordinator nodes for spectrum sensing and data dissemination.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732251","startPage":"1447","endPage":"1452","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and

Most of the existing works of pin-constrained biochip designs and pin reduction solutions are applicable for specific biotechnology applications. A proficient electrowetting-on-dielectric based architecture namely Microelectrode Dot Array (MEDA) has recently been introduced as a new, highly reconfigurable, scalable and field programmable dot array architecture being capable of undergoing dynamic configuration. In this paper, we present some essential sufficient pin-assignment architecture on pin-constrained MEDA based biochips and propose a pin assignment technique for multifunctional biochips in order to solve the pin reduction problem. Some random specific benchmarks are used for evaluating our technique to prove its effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732271","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732271.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","startPage":"1565","endPage":"1570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automated design of pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochip on MEDA architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An automated design of pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochip on MEDA architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732271/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429687","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732271/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automated design of pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochip on MEDA architecture","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP2571570293429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063135S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732277,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These generation of data is increasing day by day from various sources such as automated data collection tools, database systems, e-commerce and social media websites. There is an explosive growth of data from terabytes to petabytes. It is essential to extract valuable knowledge from these large data. Since large amount of data is available, people look for valuable knowledge from the available data. Several mining algorithms are used to extract interesting patterns from the data stored in a repository. Traditional data sources are static in nature that the content are not generated very rapidly. Data streams are the streams of information that are generated at very rapid rate. After the evolution of data streams, the need arises to think of a new algorithm to process it. There are various data stream algorithms used for mining the data streams with different requirements. In this work, the ensemble of classifiers model has been developed for mining the data streams by combining stream mining classifiers such as Similarity-based Data Stream Classifier (SimC) and Online Genetic Algorithm (OGA) classifier. The performance of ensemble based classifiers show improved classification accuracy and less classification error rate under various circumstances.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732277","startPage":"1601","endPage":"1607","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732277.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble learning for network data stream classification using similarity and online genetic algorithm classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732277/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ensemble learning for network data stream classification using similarity and online genetic algorithm classifiers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732277/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16444536","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble learning for network data stream classification using similarity and online genetic algorithm classifiers","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP2631570285247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055859S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732279,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Workflows are usually represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), in which the nodes represent the tasks involved in the process and the edges represents the dependency between the tasks. Workflow scheduling is the process of assigning the tasks to suitable resources for execution. Even though DAG is the efficient format for representing workflow, it cannot be used directly as input to programs that perform workflow scheduling and execution. Hence representing workflow in a suitable format for scheduling is a major challenge for researchers working in this area. This paper proposes a Realistic Workflow Scheduler that accepts the workflow in graphical format, converts it into a suitable text format and perform appropriate scheduling. The scheduler implements the Workflow Definition Converter (WDC) to convert the workflow represented in graphical format to text file format that can be directly given as input to any program or simulator for scheduling and execution. The Critical Path Finder is used to identify the critical path of the workflow. In addition to that the Deadline Constrained (DC) and Cost Constrained (CC) workflow scheduling algorithms have been implemented to schedule the workflow in a suitable cloud computing environment. The correctness of this work is also verified by scheduling popular workflows like Montage and Inspiral using the proposed scheduler.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732279","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732279.pdf","startPage":"1615","endPage":"1621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A realistic approach for representing and scheduling workflows in cloud computing environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732279/","displayDocTitle":"A realistic approach for representing and scheduling workflows in cloud computing environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444550","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732279/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A realistic approach for representing and scheduling workflows in cloud computing environment","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP2651570284463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08091S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732280,"authors":[{"name":"Siddharth Raghuwanshi","affiliation":["Department of ECE, NIT Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Siddharth","lastName":"Raghuwanshi","id":"37085890195"},{"name":"Pranabesh Maji","affiliation":["Department of ECE, NIT Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Pranabesh","lastName":"Maji","id":"37085884226"},{"name":"Sanjay Dhar Roy","affiliation":["Department of ECE, NIT Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay Dhar","lastName":"Roy","id":"37400812100"},{"name":"Sumit Kundu","affiliation":["Nalanda Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, IN"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37401883600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732280","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Energy harvesting","Interference","Channel capacity","Cognitive radio","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decode and forward communication","energy harvesting","multi-access systems","quality of service","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication power management","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual hop cognitive relay network","CRN","energy harvesting relay","physical layer security","secrecy outage probability","SOP","decode and forward relaying system","eavesdropper","relay node","power splitting-based relaying","PSR scheme","RF signal","primary user","secondary user","transmit power","quality of service","QOS","interference threshold","channel mean power","illegitimate communication channels","energy harvesting conversion efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Harvesting (EH)","Power Splitting-based Relay (PSR)","Secrecy Capacity","Secrecy Outage Probability (SOP)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732280","abstract":"In this work, the physical (PHY) layer security is investigated in terms of secrecy outage probability (SOP) for a dual hop decode and forward relaying system in a cognitive relay network (CRN) in presence of an eavesdropper.

However, many urban commuters tend to post updates about traffic on various social media in the form of tweets or Facebook posts. With the copious amount of data made available upon traffic problems on social media sites, we collect historical data about traffic posts from specific cities and build a sentiment classifier to monitor commuters' emotions round the clock. The knowledge is used to analyze and predict traffic patterns in a given location. Also we identify the probable cause of a traffic congestion in a particular area by analyzing the collected historical data.

The system is designed based on quasi complementary sequence set (QCSS) over a quasi-asynchronous environment. SC-FDMA-CDMA provides lower peak to average power ratio than that of MC-CDMA technology. The QCSS code is generated over the complex roots of unity and has a low correlation property which makes SC-FDMA-CDMA suitable over the quasi-asynchronous environment. In addition, QCSS can support more users than that of perfect complementary sequence sets. A complete transceiver structure has been provided in detail. The system performance has been derived from a simulation and analytical studies.

Data analytics and learning based methods can provide an effective framework for prognostic studies by accurately classifying data instances into relevant classes based on the tumor severity. Accordingly, a multivariate statistical approach has been coupled with an artificial intelligence based learning technique to implement a prediction model. Principal components analysis pre-processes the data and extracts features in the most relevant form for training an artificial neural network that learns the patterns in the data for classification of new instances. The diagnostic data of the original Wisconsin breast cancer database accessed from the UCI machine learning repository has been used in the study. The proposed hybrid model shows promising results when compared with other classification algorithms used most commonly in the literature and can provide a future scope for creation of more sophisticated machine learning based cancer prognostic models.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732327","startPage":"1896","endPage":"1901","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732327.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network based breast cancer prognosis model with PCA processed features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Breast cancer","Principal component analysis","Predictive models","Prognostics and health management","Databases","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical computing","neural nets","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based breast cancer prognosis model","data analytics","multivariate statistical approach","principal components analysis","feature extraction","artificial neural network","Wisconsin breast cancer database","UCI machine learning repository","PCA","artificial intelligence based learning technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Network","Classification","Prognosis","Prediction model","Principal Component Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A neural network based breast cancer prognosis model with PCA processed features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732327/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444570","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based breast cancer prognosis model with PCA processed features","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP3131570278534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066191S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7732330,"authors":[{"name":"Debanjan Konar","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Sikkim, India"],"firstName":"Debanjan","lastName":"Konar","id":"37085730021"},{"name":"Udit Kr.

The proposed QPBDSONN replicates the Parallel Bi-directional Self-Organizing Neural Network (PBDSONN) architecture and exploits by the power of quantum computation. To process three distinct basic color components (Red, Green and Blue) of noisy color image, QPBDSONN uses trinity of Quantum Bi-directional Self-organizing Neural Network (QBDSONN) architecture at the source layer in parallel mode. Each constituent QBDSONN comprises input, intermediate or hidden and output layers interconnected by 8-connected neighborhood topology based layer of neurons represented by qubits. Each constituent QBDSONN updates weighted interconnections in the form of quantum states through counter-propagation between hidden and output layer to obviate quantum back propagation. Rotation gates are introduced to represent weighted inter-links and values of activation. Finally, a quantum measurement operation is performed at the output layer of each constituent QBDSONN followed by fusion operation at the sink layer of QPBDSONN to concatenate the processed color image components resulting in the true output. The superiority of the proposed network architecture over the classical PBDSONN can be established using a real-life spanner pure color image and synthetic pure color image corrupted with various intensity of uniform and Gaussian noise in terms of extraction time and shapes.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732330","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732330.pdf","startPage":"1912","endPage":"1918","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quantum parallel bi-directional self-organizing neural network (QPBDSONN) architecture for extraction of pure color objects from noisy background","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A quantum parallel bi-directional self-organizing neural network (QPBDSONN) architecture for extraction of pure color objects from noisy background","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16444600","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732330/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quantum parallel bi-directional self-organizing neural network (QPBDSONN) architecture for extraction of pure color objects from noisy background","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP3161570285225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103955S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7732339,"authors":[{"name":"Shivank Dhote","affiliation":["Vidyalankar Inst.

These systems, being designed for data heavy applications need to possess a novel architecture design for image filtering and processing. This paper presents a multifunction image processing system that is accessible over the internet and is prototyped using a System on Chip (SoC) and FPGA interface. A pipelined based approach, inspired by a shift register based Random Access Memory design has been implemented for on-the-fly computation and minimal use of on-chip resources. The realization of the system was done using a low cost Spartan 6 FPGA and a Raspberry-pi B+ representing the ARM cortex based SoC. Data transfer between the FPGA and SoC has been achieved using a UART protocol. Computation time of different frame sizes for the system and standard I.P. software tools have been documented. Chip utilization and delays have also been reported.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732339","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732339.pdf","startPage":"1963","endPage":"1968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using FPGA-SoC interface for low cost IoT based image processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Using FPGA-SoC interface for low cost IoT based image processing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732339/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429775","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using FPGA-SoC interface for low cost IoT based image processing","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP3251570284310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065022S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732352,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish Semwal","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, GBPEC, Pauri Garhwal, India"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Semwal","id":"37085884665"},{"name":"H.

Noise processing of these signals for speech recognition systems is generally articulated as a digital filtering process in which noisy speech is passed through linear filter to obtain the clean speech estimation. This paper focuses on noise estimation, removal and speech enhancement techniques.

In the proposed scheduling scheme Mt transmitter selects Mt most favorable users in terms of received signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio (SINR) at each user. To reduce feedback load in the reverse channel, we quantize the SINR values into few bits and the quantized bits are feedback to the transmitter side instead of the real values of SINR. We consider two approaches of using the threshold in determining the quantization levels in the process. In the first approach we consider a fixed threshold for all set of users where as in the second approach an adaptive threshold technique is used in which the threshold values are determined depending on the number of users. The achievable throughput using full SINR feedback and quantized SINR feedback are compared. The variation of the achieved throughput with the number of quantization bits is also presented. The comparison between the proposed quantized SINR based scheduling scheme with the full SINR feedback scheme in terms of the feedback load is also presented. Although the proposed scheme compromises on the achieved throughput but it has a remarkable advantage in terms of reduced feedback.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on

This in turn has led to development of various unequal error protection (UEP) schemes. In this paper, the performance of optimized 2-layered and 3-layered UEP schemes using hierarchical 64 QAM (64-HQAM) for wavelet-transformed images coded with set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm and transmitted over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is investigated. A look-up table (LUT) based approach to select the optimal values of modulation parameters of 64-HQAM for different channel conditions is suggested so as to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results show that 3-layered optimized 64-HQAM-based UEP outperforms corresponding non-optimized UEP. Also, 3-layered optimized UEP scheme using 64-HQAM performs slightly better as compared to optimized 2-layered UEP scheme using 64-HQAM.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732380","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732380.pdf","startPage":"2213","endPage":"2218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized multi-layered unequal error protection of SPIHT coded images using 64-HQAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732380/","displayDocTitle":"Optimized multi-layered unequal error protection of SPIHT coded images using 64-HQAM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444496","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732380/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized multi-layered unequal error protection of SPIHT coded images using 64-HQAM","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP3661570282331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053979S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732401,"authors":[{"name":"Anjan Bandyopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, NIT Durgapur, Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Anjan","lastName":"Bandyopadhyay","id":"37085897324"},{"name":"Sajal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, NIT Durgapur, Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Sajal","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37404298800"},{"name":"Uttam Ganguly","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Mallabhum Institute of Technology, Bishnupur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Uttam","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"38019426300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732401","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Resource management","Computational modeling","Pricing","Computer architecture","Time complexity","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","resource allocation","economic settings","mechanism design","service providers","charitable environment","DSIC mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","mechanism design","resource allocation","DSIC","core allocation"]}],"abstract":"The economic settings of allocating resources in cloud computing have been studied, so far, by the concept of mechanism design with money.

The design of such WCRs is a challenging task due to huge area, high cost, limited speed and dynamic range of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) as well as poor reconfigurability of analog front-end. Recently, non-uniform (or sub-Nyquist) sampling techniques have been envisioned to digitize sparse wideband signal using existing ADCs. However, subsequent digital reconstruction works well only when the number of active users in the received signal are known i.e. they are not blind. To overcome this, a new Adaptive Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (AOMP) blind reconstruction approach has been proposed in this paper. The term adaptive means that the parameters of the AOMP are dynamically tuned based on learned spectral occupancy and channel quality statistics. The novelty of the AOMP is the use of online learning algorithm to estimate spectrum occupancy (or sparsity). Extensive simulation and complexity results indicate the superiority of the proposed AOMP approach over existing approaches for wide range of SNRs and different levels of sparsity. Numerically, AOMP offers as high as 64.5% improvement in normalized mean square error over existing approaches with slight penalty in terms of computational complexity. In the end, performance comparison of various reconstruction approaches for automatic modulation classification application is presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732404","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732404.pdf","startPage":"2341","endPage":"2345","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind and adaptive reconstruction approach for non-uniformly sampled wideband signal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Blind and adaptive reconstruction approach for non-uniformly sampled wideband signal","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732404/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429747","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732404/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind and adaptive reconstruction approach for non-uniformly sampled wideband signal","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP3901570294610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057822S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7732412,"authors":[{"name":"Ch.

It is an air vehicle which has multiple rotors (in our paper it is 4) and is controlled by the RC transmitter (joysticks). An attempt has been made to detect the bomb by using Geiger counter module. Geiger module can detect any type of radioactive radiation emitted from the Bomb. Bomb location information is sent to the user by making use of GPS and GSM modules. We integrated Geiger module, GPS module, GSM module, Arduino-UNO as a payload to the quadcopter. We need to pass the quadcopter on the area in which the operator wants to examine and if any Bomb is present, then Geiger tube detects it. Then immediately Bomb location is sent to the operator's mobile by GPS and GSM modules. The main objective of this paper is to ensure the safety of the operator and to reduce the detection process time when compared to manual detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unmanned aerial vehicle based bomb detection","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732412","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732412.pdf","startPage":"2385","endPage":"2389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Unmanned aerial vehicle based bomb detection","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732412/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444535","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unmanned aerial vehicle based bomb detection","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP3981570301781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061507S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732413,"authors":[{"name":"Arushi Singh","affiliation":["Deptt. of Telecommunication, Shri Govindram Sakseriya Institute of Science and Technology, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Arushi","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085905146"},{"name":"Anjana Jain","affiliation":["Deptt. of Telecommunication, Shri Govindram Sakseriya Institute of Science and Technology, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Anjana","lastName":"Jain","id":"37422241500"},{"name":"Prakash Vyavahare","affiliation":["Deptt. of Telecommunication, Shri Govindram Sakseriya Institute of Science and Technology, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Prakash","lastName":"Vyavahare","id":"37370215000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732413","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Light emitting diodes","Modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free-space optical communication","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak to average power ratio","VLC-OFDM system performance degradation","5G mobile communication","nonlinear distortion mitigation","LED nonlinear characteristics","multiple subcarrier modulation","advanced A-law companding technique","A-law companding technique","\u03bc-law companding technique","PAPR issue removal","visible light communication"]}],"abstract":"VLC-OFDM is proposed to be used as the transmission technique in 5G mobile communication. VLC-OFDM produces the non-linear distortion due to non linear characteristics of LEDs and the PAPR of multiple sub-carrier modulation. The mitigation of non-linear distortion in VLC system is presently focused by many researchers, as it degrades system performance. Since the technique used in VLC system is OFDM so the system suffers the drawbacks of OFDM as well as VLC. Therefore, the non-linearity in the VLC-OFDM is quite severe. Hence, three companding techniques(A-law, \u03bc-law, advanced A-law) can be implemented to remove the PAPR issue. Comparatively, advance A-law provides lower PAP ratio. This paper proposes these three non-linear companding techniques for reducing PAPR in VLC-OFDM system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of peak to average power ratio for different companding techniques in VLC-OFDM system","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732413","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732413.pdf","startPage":"2390","endPage":"2393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A study of peak to average power ratio for different companding techniques in VLC-OFDM system","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732413/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429716","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of peak to average power ratio for different companding techniques in VLC-OFDM system","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP3991570297214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057563S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732415,"authors":[{"name":"Navneet Kaur Saini","affiliation":["M.Tech Electrical Engineering Department IIT Delhi"],"firstName":"Navneet Kaur","lastName":"Saini","id":"37085899820"},{"name":"Aniruddha Gupta","affiliation":["M.Tech Electrical Engineering Department IIT Delhi"],"firstName":"Aniruddha","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085906669"},{"name":"Ravija Prashar","affiliation":["M.Tech Electrical Engineering Department IIT Delhi"],"firstName":"Ravija","lastName":"Prashar","id":"37085899681"},{"name":"Parul Gupta","affiliation":["M.Tech Electrical Engineering Department IIT Delhi"],"firstName":"Parul","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085907217"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732415","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Random access memory","Inverters","Capacitance","Decoding","Threshold voltage","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout","high-speed integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power circuit techniques","high speed SRAM","UMC technology","SRAM floor plan","sense amplifiers","replica based circuits","replica memory cells","replica memory bitlines","wordline pulse widths","inverters techniques","power gating technique","voltage 1 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low Power","SRAM","Replica","Divided word line approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732415","abstract":"As we are migrating toward low supply voltages, the threshold and supply voltage fluctuations will begin to have larger impact on the speed and power specification of SRAMs. Here, we present different techniques which minimize the effect of operating condition's variability on the speed and power of SRAM. A 2MB SRAM is designed with umc90nm technology having power supply of 1V. Firstly, the floor plan of SRAM uses hierarchical and divided word line approach which helps in reducing power by switching on only that part of SRAM which is being accessed. Secondly, SRAM major power is consumed by sense amplifiers, so replica based circuits are used which have replica memory cells and bitlines used to create a reference signal whose delay tracks that of the bitlines. This signal is used to generate the sense clock with minimal slack time and control wordline pulse widths to limit bitline swings. We implement the replica circuits by using bitline capacitance ratioing and compared it with standard chain of inverters techniques. Furthermore, a partial power gating technique is also implemented in local word driver which also reduces power. This SRAM is also tested at various process corners.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732415","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732415.pdf","startPage":"2399","endPage":"2404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low power circuit techniques for optimizing power in high speed SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Low power circuit techniques for optimizing power in high speed SRAMs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732415/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429696","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power circuit techniques for optimizing power in high speed SRAMs","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"RP4011570297343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056025S","chronDate":"21-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592392","isNumber":"7732013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592392","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7732013","articleId":"7732415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732432,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya Agarwal","affiliation":["Center for Cloud Computing and Big Data Computer Science Department PES University, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37085894202"},{"name":"Syed Munawwar Quadri","affiliation":["Center for Cloud Computing and Big Data Computer Science Department PES University, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Syed Munawwar","lastName":"Quadri","id":"37085887525"},{"name":"Savitha Murthy","affiliation":["Center for Cloud Computing and Big Data Computer Science Department PES University, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Savitha","lastName":"Murthy","id":"37085745111"},{"name":"Dinkar Sitaram","affiliation":["Center for Cloud Computing and Big Data Computer Science Department PES University, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Dinkar","lastName":"Sitaram","id":"38195097300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2029-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2028-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2030-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732432","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732432","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Artificial neural networks","Event detection","Source separation","Principal component analysis","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","backpropagation","cepstral analysis","feedforward neural nets","matrix decomposition","principal component analysis","signal classification","signal detection","source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimally supervised sound event detection","feed forward neural network","single sound minimally annotated data set","polyphonic sounds","single hidden layer","autoencoder","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient feature vectors","MFCC feature vectors","neural network training","back propagation","principal component analysis","PCA","nonnegative matrix factorization","NMF","source separated sounds","sound classification","feed-forward algorithm","minimal training set","learning","sound detection system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732432","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592392/7732013/07732432.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","startPage":"2495","endPage":"2500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimally supervised sound event detection using a neural network","abstract":"This paper proposes a sound event detection system that is trained using a minimally annotated data set of single sounds to identify and separate components of polyphonic sounds.

The idea is to utilise the unused licensed radio frequencies in the absence of the licensed users called Primary Users (PUs) and leave the same when the licensed users return. However, there are several security threats holding back the successful realisation of CR networks. Primary User Emulation Attack (PUEA) is one such major threat in CR networks, in which the attackers disguise themselves as PUs by mimicking the signal characteristics of the PUs, in order to make the legitimate Secondary Users (SUs) erroneously identify the attackers as PUs and hence, vacate the spectrum. It is obvious that such attacks will cause many SUs to lose access to the network services leading to overall performance degradation in the entire network.

The long-term aim is to get a deeper and more accurate understanding of the physics to be able to further fine tune analytical theories about inter-bar currents. This work is used to verify the model and to get an idea of what can be achieved with it in the future. The geometry, the partial differential equation and specific material properties as substitutes for the rotor lamination are introduced. After that the boundary conditions are presented, including the Neumann condition to replace the whole stator geometry with its winding heads. The closing verification is split up into two steps. In the first step the 3D model is verified without inter-bar currents while a validated analytical tool is used as reference. In the second step inter-bar currents are added and an experiment is used to verify the simulation. As a side result of the verification, the results show that the inter-bar current is affected by two separate convergence effects, depending on the slip and the inter-bar resistance. The results additionally show that a low stacking factor can equalise the influence of a band of different inter-bar resistances on the torque-speed behaviour.","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732500","publicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592391/7732494/07732500.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D FEM approach to study the physics of inter-bar currents in induction machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732500/","displayDocTitle":"3D FEM approach to study the physics of inter-bar currents in induction machines","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444428","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732500/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D FEM approach to study the physics of inter-bar currents in induction machines","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0018lf000426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051405S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592391","isNumber":"7732494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592391","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7732494","articleId":"7732500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732542,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Rajabi Moghaddam","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, Vasteras, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Reza Rajabi Moghaddam received B.Sc.

A new mathematical formulation of the coenergy is combined with the Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations to investigate the effectiveness of the main idea. A 3kW Synchronous Reluctance Machine (SynRM) is used in this verification. Different operating scenarios are developed and investigated including unbalanced operating conditions with large negative sequence currents.

However, these kind of machines has high torque ripple. This is due to the high harmonic content in the magnetomotive force which interacts with the rotor anisotropy. To the aim of minimizing this ripple, a proper selection of the end angles of the flux barriers should be adopted. Air-gap field, the electromagnetic torque and the torque ripple are predicted by an analytical model. An optimization strategy is applied to this fast model to achieve a smooth torque with a suitable rotor geometry. A validation of the proposed method is assessed by comparing the optimization outputs to the re-evaluated FE analysis of the machine. The results considered over a wide range of solutions will show the excellent capability of the analytical model. The final aim of this work is to predict the end barrier angles position as an preliminary starting point for the rotor design of synchronous reluctance machines.","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732585","publicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592391/7732494/07732585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732494","startPage":"585","endPage":"591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronous reluctance machine analytical model optimization and validation through finite element analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous reluctance machine analytical model optimization and validation through finite element analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732585/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444358","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732585/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous reluctance machine analytical model optimization and validation through finite element analysis","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0585lf007978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082883S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592391","isNumber":"7732494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592391","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7732494","articleId":"7732585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732587,"authors":[{"name":"Yashan Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Yashan Hu received the B.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from the Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

The effectiveness of the torque capability enhancement is confirmed by experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732587","publicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592391/7732494/07732587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732494","startPage":"599","endPage":"605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque capability enhancement of dual three-phase PMSM drive with fifth and seventh current harmonics injection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Torque capability enhancement of dual three-phase PMSM drive with fifth and seventh current harmonics injection","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732587/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444356","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732587/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque capability enhancement of dual three-phase PMSM drive with fifth and seventh current harmonics injection","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0599lf000892.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090921S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592391","isNumber":"7732494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592391","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7732494","articleId":"7732587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732646,"authors":[{"name":"Yashan Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.

It is also found that there is potential instability for the two-individual current control, which is due to the mutual coupling between the two sets of 3-phase windings. That being the case, this paper investigates the mutual coupling conditions under which the two-individual current control stable operation can be guaranteed. Under the stable operation, the two-individual current control loops could have the same dynamic performance as the VSD control.

At first, a novel torque ripple model is proposed. In this model, both spatial harmonics of magnet flux linkage and current time harmonics induced by machine drive are considered, which includes the torque ripples resulted from magnet torque, reluctance torque and cogging torque. Based on the proposed model, a novel genetic algorithm (GA) based dq-axis harmonic currents optimization approach is proposed for torque ripple minimization. In this approach, the GA is applied to optimize both the magnitude and phase of the harmonic currents to achieve the objectives of: 1) minimizing the peak-to-peak torque ripple; 2) minimizing the sum of squares of the harmonic currents; and 3) maximizing the average torque component produced by the injected harmonic currents. The results demonstrate that the magnitude of the harmonic current can be significantly reduced by considering the phase angles of these harmonic currents as the optimization parameters. This leads to further suppression of the torque ripple when compared to that of a case where phase angles are not considered in the optimization. Also, an increase of the average torque is achieved when the optimum harmonic currents are injected. The proposed model and approach are evaluated with both numerical and experimental investigations on a laboratory interior PMSM.","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732655","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592391/7732494/07732655.pdf","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1056","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","publicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm based current optimization for torque ripple reduction of interior PMSMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based current optimization for torque ripple reduction of interior PMSMs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16444303","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732655/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based current optimization for torque ripple reduction of interior PMSMs","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1050lf010626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071216S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592391","isNumber":"7732494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592391","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7732494","articleId":"7732655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732670,"authors":[{"name":"Diogo B.

Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the algorithm with smoothly and stably response.","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732675","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592391/7732494/07732675.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732675","publicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding mode observer sensorless vector controlled induction motor drive with anti-windup PI speed controller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sliding mode observer sensorless vector controlled induction motor drive with anti-windup PI speed controller","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732675/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732675/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444409","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sliding mode observer sensorless vector controlled induction motor drive with anti-windup PI speed controller","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1187lf008982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070934S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592391","isNumber":"7732494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592391","xplore-issue":"7732494","articleId":"7732675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7732755,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The standard industrial motor frame sizes along with the current design trends of larger lengths and smaller diameters are taken into account, which are not likely presented in literature. In this context, a computer-aided design approach of a SPIM -based mainly on the classical output coefficient-is proposed first. Numerous simulations using Finite Elements Method (FEM) are conducted in order to verify the proposed procedure and investigations regarding the number of stator and rotor slots are performed. Secondly, based on the previous results, a neural network (NN) scheme is proposed in order to estimate the efficiency of SPIMs with various stator/rotor slots combinations and different output power. It is seen that the proposed methodology is verified satisfactorily and could be of great use as an aid tool to industrial SPIM designers.","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732789","startPage":"1942","endPage":"1948","publicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732494","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592391/7732494/07732789.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the neural network single phase induction motor efficiency estimation as a design tool","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732789/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the neural network single phase induction motor efficiency estimation as a design tool","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732789/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16444326","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the neural network single phase induction motor efficiency estimation as a design tool","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1942lf006866.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095672S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592391","isNumber":"7732494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592391","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7732494","articleId":"7732789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7732805,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Hence, the finite element analysis is currently used to design and optimize SynRM, from the first instance. This method usually requires a high amount of computational time and resources. For this reason, the reluctance network here proposed is a good alternative to consider for designing these motors, because it is a fast and good method to obtain the inductances of the SynRM.

This high accuracy is reached due to an improved torque calculation method compared to models used in previous work. The methodology is based on that the current response obtained from the analytical calculations have been fed back to the FEM calculations for determination of the magnet and iron losses in the motor, reducing the simulation time significantly compared to a voltage fed FEM model. The temperature dependence of the magnet strength and stator resistance have also been taken into account when comparing the simulation result with measurements.","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732814","publicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XXII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592391/7732494/07732814.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2016.7732814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732494","startPage":"2112","endPage":"2118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time efficient FEM modeling of a PMSM by iteration between field calculations and state","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time efficient FEM modeling of a PMSM by iteration between field calculations and state","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732814/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16444252","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7732814/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time efficient FEM modeling of a PMSM by iteration between field calculations and state","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"2112lf008966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056369S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592391","isNumber":"7732494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592391","xplore-issue":"7732494","articleId":"7732814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732822,"authors":[{"name":"Wagner F.

Induction motors are widely used in several industrial applications due to its robustness, low cost and high reliability. Early detection and proper fault diagnosis reduce the maintenance cost and also increase process effectiveness. The amplitude of the stator current signal, in the time domain is presented as input to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network for the classification of stator faults. After a proper discretization of the current signal, the technique of principal components analysis (PCA) is applied allowing a reduction of the classifier complexity. Results obtained from 750 experimental tests are provided and compared to validate this study. The obtained results indicate that this approach can be employed to classify stator short-circuit faults in inverter-fed induction motors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732822/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16444250","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732822/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An application of artificial neural networks and PCA for stator fault diagnosis in inverter-fed induction motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of artificial neural networks and PCA for stator fault diagnosis in inverter-fed induction motors","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"2165lf008672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072083S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592391","isNumber":"7732494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592391","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7732494","articleId":"7732822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7732854,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando J.

In electric motor driven systems it can be used, for example, to estimate the motor load or pulley-belt transmission slip. Encoders and resolvers are typically used for continuous speed monitoring, requiring mechanical coupling with the rotating shaft/part. If the speed is to be measured at a given instant or during a few moments, noninvasive contactless optical tachometers can be used, using optical reflection or stroboscopic principles. In most cases, stroboscopic tachometers require no reflective elements/strips in the rotating part. However, if the user wants to continuously measure the speed of a given rotating part during the audit/characterization period, with real-time data logging and without sticking reflective strips or introducing shaft-coupled encoders/resolvers, there is no low-cost commercial solution to perform such task. For example, if the user's aim is to continuously estimate the load variation of an induction motor over a day or week, on the basis of the slip/speed value, it is not possible with conventional commercial low-cost contactless equipment, unless the user uses expensive online-operation equipment estimating the speed by means of input voltage/current. Moreover, in some rotating systems/parts not directly driven by an electric motor, the online equipment cannot be used and it is not practical, and in some cases even impossible, to couple an encoder/resolver or stick some reflective strips. In this paper, an innovative nonintrusive low-cost webcam-based tachometer is proposed, developed and experimentally tested. It can be used to easily estimate and record the speed over time in, for example, electrical motors, pulleys, shafts and wind turbines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732854/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16444074","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732854/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Webcam-based tachometer for in-field induction motor load estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Webcam-based tachometer for in-field induction motor load estimation","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"2380lf010537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075161S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592391","isNumber":"7732494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592391","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7732494","articleId":"7732854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7732884,"authors":[{"name":"Masahito Miyoshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Masahito Miyoshi received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of the Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2014 and 2016, respectively.

Therefore, damping force is not generated in the axial and tilting directions. As a result, when a disturbance is applied to the rotor, vibration is inherently unavoidable. In this paper, a novel axial vibration suppression method by d-axis current is proposed. The damping force is generated by d-axis current regulation. In this proposed method, the rotor axial position is estimated from the flux linkage variation in the motor winding. Therefore, an additional displacement sensor is not necessary. In experiments, it is confirmed that the rotor axial vibration is successfully suppressed by the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732884/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16444262","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732884/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Axial vibration suppression by field flux regulation in two-axis actively positioned permanent magnet bearingless motors with axial position estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Axial vibration suppression by field flux regulation in two-axis actively positioned permanent magnet bearingless motors with axial position estimation","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"2574lf010553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100195S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592391","isNumber":"7732494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592391","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7732494","articleId":"7732884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7732964,"authors":[{"name":"Wahida Nasrin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"],"firstName":"Wahida","lastName":"Nasrin","id":"38190759400"},{"name":"Jiang Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37279378300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1732-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1733-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732964","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocell networks","Mobile radio mobility management","Interference","Macrocell networks","Cognitive radio","TV","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","femtocellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio femtocell networks","mobility management scheme","channel heterogeneity","heterogeneous networks","channel under-utilization","channel interference","spectrum handoff","spectrum sharing","macro-to-femto handoffs","femto-to-macro handoffs","adaptive HO-threshold selection scheme"]}],"abstract":"Combining femtocell networks and cognitive radio (CR) technology is one of the most promising solutions to offload emerging traffic from cellular networks. Mobility management is an essential function to support traffic offloading in heterogeneous networks. In traditional femtocell networks, numerous solutions have been proposed to support mobility. However, in CR femtocell networks, the mobility management issue remains unexplored. More importantly, due to the channel heterogeneity in CR femtocell networks, some unique challenges of channel under-utilization and interference are introduced. Although channel heterogeneity is considered for spectrum handoff and spectrum sharing in pure CR networks, the impact of channel heterogeneity on mobility management is never addressed in CR femtocell networks. In this paper, we propose a mobility management scheme for both macro-to-femto and femto-to-macro handoffs while taking channel heterogeneity into account. Additionally, we propose an adaptive HO-threshold selection scheme combined with our proposed mobility management scheme by taking the interference from PUs and neighboring femtocells into account. An analytical model is proposed to calculate the interference. Simulation results show significant performance improvement of the proposed mobility management scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers mobility management and channel heterogeneity jointly in CR femtocell networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mobility Management Scheme to Reduce the Impact of Channel Heterogeneity in Cognitive Radio Femtocell Networks","publicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7732964","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731571/7732953/07732964.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7732964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Mobility Management Scheme to Reduce the Impact of Channel Heterogeneity in Cognitive Radio Femtocell Networks","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732964/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16447518","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mobility Management Scheme to Reduce the Impact of Channel Heterogeneity in Cognitive Radio Femtocell Networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1177604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088204S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731571","isNumber":"7732953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731571","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7732953","articleId":"7732964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732974,"authors":[{"name":"Avishek Mukherjee","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Avishek","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37085848657"},{"name":"Zhenghao Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenghao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279626000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1732-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1733-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732974","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"abstract":"We propose CSIFit, an algorithm that compresses the Channel State Information (CSI) of Wi-Fi networks with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO). CSIFit achieves high compression ratio by finding a sinusoidal representation of the CSI, usually with very few sinusoids such as 3, while using common frequencies and amplitudes for different transmitting and receiving antenna pairs. CSIFit is inspired by the fact that a physical path results in a sinusoid in the CSI, however with the key insight that for the purpose of compression, not every path needs to reproduced. That is, the data model can be relaxed to allow the parameters to take values with no explicit physical meanings, as long as it helps to achieve higher compression ratio. Viewing the problem as a curve-fitting problem, CSIFit is built on top of the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm with many optimizations to improve the convergence speed and accuracy, including dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems and light- weight methods to find good initial guess. We evaluate CSIFit with both experimental and synthesized CSI data and the results show that CSIFit can achieve high compression ratio with little loss of accuracy. We also implement CSIFit in C++ and find that the median execution time for typical experimental data is only around 8 ms on typical computers and around 65 ms on a slower computer.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731571/7732953/07732974.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7732974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7732974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel State Information Compression for MIMO Systems Based on Curve Fitting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","MIMO","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","curve fitting","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple input multiple output systems","MIMO systems","channel state information compression","curve-fitting problem","CSIFit algorithm","Wi-Fi networks","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","sinusoidal representation","transmitting antenna","receiving antenna","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","C++ implementation","median execution time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Channel State Information Compression for MIMO Systems Based on Curve Fitting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732974/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16447545","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel State Information Compression for MIMO Systems Based on Curve Fitting","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1177536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074068S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731571","isNumber":"7732953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731571","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7732953","articleId":"7732974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7732989,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Schmid","affiliation":["Disney Research & ETH Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37291038900"},{"name":"Thomas Richner","affiliation":["Disney Research & ETH Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Richner","id":"37085892832"},{"name":"Stefan Mangold","affiliation":["Lovefield Wireless, Berne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Mangold","id":"37284241500"},{"name":"Thomas R.

Visible Light Communication (VLC) based on Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) is an attractive communication fabric for the IoT, as LEDs are readily available and can serve as transmitters as well as receivers. LED light bulbs, enhanced with photodiodes, provide an attractive path to extend device-to-device communication to room area networking. This paper describes a VLC system, called EnLighting, based on light bulbs that support an embedded Linux version (and its complete networking stack). These programmable light bulbs can both send and receive; they can communicate with objects in a room as well as with other light bulbs nearby. Bidirectional communication allows a light bulb to actively participate in networking and simplifies deployment, maintenance, configuration, and controllability of indoor lighting installations and services. EnLighting supports low-bandwidth communication services in a room (and via a gateway, beyond the room), which provide the base for other applications, e.g., a location service. This paper includes an initial evaluation of a room area communication and localization network based on prototype Linux-enabled light bulbs, reporting the performance for different network traffic types, and shows the benefits obtained from bidirectional communication. This proof-of- concept system illustrates that simple devices can provide an attractive solution to future communication challenges in the saturated radio spectrum.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7732989","publicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731571/7732953/07732989.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7732989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EnLighting: An Indoor Visible Light Communication System Based on Networked Light Bulbs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EnLighting: An Indoor Visible Light Communication System Based on Networked Light Bulbs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7732989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7732989/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16447508","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EnLighting: An Indoor Visible Light Communication System Based on Networked Light Bulbs","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1177218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059948S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731571","isNumber":"7732953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731571","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7732953","articleId":"7732989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7732999,"authors":[{"name":"Alain Olivier","affiliation":["IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, Spain","IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Olivier","id":"37085757837"},{"name":"Guillermo Bielsa","affiliation":["IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, Spain","IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Bielsa","id":"37085886709"},{"name":"Irene Tejado","affiliation":["IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, Spain","IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Irene","lastName":"Tejado","id":"37085886030"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi","id":"37085365323"},{"name":"Joerg Widmer","affiliation":["IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Joerg","lastName":"Widmer","id":"37295574900"},{"name":"Paolo Casari","affiliation":["IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Casari","id":"37296365200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1732-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1733-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7732999","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":886},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7732999","abstract":"In this paper, we target single-anchor localization schemes for millimeter wave (MMW) systems.

We evaluate the algorithms by means of simulations, and draw conclusions on their robustness. We then validate our results via measurements involving commercial pre- standard 60- GHz MMW hardware. Our experiments confirm that, by relying only on a single anchor and without requiring complex signal processing at the receiver, the algorithms can localize a node with high probability, and in many cases with sub-meter accuracy.

To realize the IIoT vision, this demo presents the Open- WSN and OpenMote projects, which provide both an open-source software implementation of the IEEE low-power wireless technologies and the IETF protocol stack, and an open-source hardware platform that meets the requirements to prototype IIoT applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7733004","publicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731571/7732953/07733004.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7733004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OpenWSN & OpenMote: Demo'ing a Complete Ecosystem for the Industrial Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"OpenWSN & OpenMote: Demo'ing a Complete Ecosystem for the Industrial Internet of Things","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733004/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16447559","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733004/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OpenWSN & OpenMote: Demo'ing a Complete Ecosystem for the Industrial Internet of Things","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1178342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044396S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731571","isNumber":"7732953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731571","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7732953","articleId":"7733004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7733009,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Tae Hong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Tae","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085901505"},{"name":"Hyoil Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoil","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292768900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1732-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1733-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7733009","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":842},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Optimal scheduling","Processor scheduling","Mobile communication","Cloud computing","Cost function","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","dynamic programming","mobile computing","numerical analysis","quality of experience","telecommunication power management","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of experience","QoE aware computation offloading scheduling","energy-latency tradeoff","mobile cloud","mobile devices","optimal transmission scheduling","mobile-to-cloud task offloading","user centric perspective","data offloading scheduling","dynamic programming","database assisted optimal DP algorithm","approximate DP algorithm","ADP algorithm","lookahead technique"]}],"abstract":"Computation offloading is a promising application of mobile clouds that can save energy of mobile devices via optimal transmission scheduling of mobile-to-cloud task offloading. Existing approaches to computation offloading have addressed various aspects of the tradeoff between energy consumption and application latency, but none of them explicitly considered the dependency in optimization on the mobile user''s context, e.g., user tendency, the remaining battery level. This paper captures such a user-centric perspective in the energy-latency tradeoff via a quality-of-experience (QoE) based cost function, and formulates the problem of data offloading scheduling as dynamic programming (DP). To derive the optimal schedule, we first introduce a database-assisted optimal DP algorithm and then propose a suboptimal but computationally-efficient approximate DP (ADP) algorithm based on the limited lookahead technique. An extensive numerical analysis has revealed that the ADP algorithm achieves near-optimal performance incurring only 2.27% extra cost on average than the optimum, and enhances QoE by up to 4.46 times compared to the energy-only scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7733009","publicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731571/7732953/07733009.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7733009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732953","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoE-Aware Computation Offloading Scheduling to Capture Energy-Latency Tradeoff in Mobile Clouds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"QoE-Aware Computation Offloading Scheduling to Capture Energy-Latency Tradeoff in Mobile Clouds","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733009/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16447514","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733009/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoE-Aware Computation Offloading Scheduling to Capture Energy-Latency Tradeoff in Mobile Clouds","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1177616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082202S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731571","isNumber":"7732953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731571","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7732953","articleId":"7733009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7733021,"authors":[{"name":"Muye Liu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Muye","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085895999"},{"name":"Avishek Mukherjee","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Avishek","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37085848657"},{"name":"Zhenghao Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenghao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085849264"},{"name":"Xiuwen Liu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiuwen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085889550"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1732-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1733-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7733021","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733021","abstract":"In this paper, we propose Time Bounded Anti- Spoofing (TBAS), a novel spoof detection method for W-Fi networks. TBAS is based on the simple idea of comparing the channel states embedded in packets received within a short interval and discarding the packets if the channel state change is above a reasonable level for the interval. We leverage the packet transmission policies in Wi-Fi to actively elicit packets for the channel state check without modifying the Wi-Fi protocol, such as sending a dummy data packet which will automatically elicit an acknowledgement packet. Comparing to the existing methods that wait passively for the packets from the packet sender for the channel state information, TBAS has the full control of time to collect the channel state, such that it can use stricter rules to classify the packets and achieve higher security. We solve key problems in TBAS, including a Channel State Check (CSC) procedure which determines if two packets are from the same sender, as well as a simple protocol wrapped around CSC to reduce the overhead. We implement TBAS on the Sora software defined ratio and our trace-driven emulations show that TBAS can achieve desirable False Positive and False Negative ratios with very low overhead.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7733021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732953","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731571/7732953/07733021.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7733021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TBAS: Enhancing Wi-Fi Authentication by Actively Eliciting Channel State Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Physical layer","Authentication","Protocols","OFDM","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","telecommunication security","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time bounded anti-spoofing","TBAS","spoof detection method","Wi-Fi networks","channel states","channel state change","packet transmission policies","dummy data packet","acknowledgement packet","channel state information","channel state check procedure","CSC procedure","Sora software defined ratio","trace-driven emulations","false positive ratios","false negative ratios"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"TBAS: Enhancing Wi-Fi Authentication by Actively Eliciting Channel State Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733021/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7733021/","accessionNumber":"16447531","publicationDate":"June 2016","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TBAS: Enhancing Wi-Fi Authentication by Actively Eliciting Channel State Information","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1177538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073985S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731571","isNumber":"7732953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731571","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7732953","articleId":"7733021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":7733034,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Wen","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Wen"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Yancun Chen","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yancun","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Zhimin Xie","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Xie"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"7733034","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Channel estimation","MIMO","Receivers","Robustness","Transceivers","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","MIMO communication","optimisation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint transceiver designs","full-duplex MIMO SWIPT systems","MSE criterion","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","mean-square-error criterion","optimization problem","semidefinite relaxation","SDR","energy harvesting constraint","power constraint","randomization method","closed-form scheme","robust beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["full-duplex","mean-square-error (MSE)","joint transceiver designs","power splitting","robust"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733034","doi":"10.1109/CC.2016.7733034","publicationTitle":"China Communications","abstract":"For the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), the full-duplex MIMO system can achieve simultaneous transmission of information and energy more efficiently than the half-duplex.

The cognitive radio networks includes the primary user (PU) system with authorized spectrum and the secondly user (SU) system without authorized spectrum. When the SUs want to use the spectrum, they have to find the idle channels that are not occupied by the PUs. So the QoS of the SUs will be affected not only by the characteristic of their own business, but also by the behavior of the PUs. Currently, in order to ensure the quality of the SU services, the M-LDWF algorithm is widely used in scheduling. However, the M-LWDF algorithm didn't fully consider the difference among the SUs. For those SUs who are in the process of communication but have to change channel due to the return of the PU, they should have higher scheduling priority. In this paper, we put forward an improved algorithm based on M-LWDF. In order to guarantee the QoS of the SUs those were in the processing of communication, we gave the higher scheduling priority. Simulation results show that the improved algorithm can effectively decrease the dropping rate and improve the QoS of the SUs and the performance of the whole system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2016.7733039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732002","startPage":"146","endPage":"152","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7732002/07733039.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The research of QoS guarantee mechanism of the secondary users in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"The research of QoS guarantee mechanism of the secondary users in cognitive radio networks","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443069","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The research of QoS guarantee mechanism of the secondary users in cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030067S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","isNumber":"7732002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"3","articleId":"7733039","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7733042,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Xiaorong Zhu","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaorong","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Xu Bao","affiliation":["Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Bao"},{"name":"Su Zhao","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Zhao"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"7733042","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":519},"abstract":"In ultra-dense networks (UDNs), large-scale deployment of femto base stations is an important technique for improving the network throughput and quality of service (QoS).

While existing text detection methods are focused on English characters, there are strong application demands on text detection in other languages, such as Chinese. In this paper, we present a novel text detection algorithm for Chinese characters based on a specific designed convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN contains a text structure component detector layer, a spatial pyramid layer, and a multi-input-layer deep belief network (DBN). The CNN is pre-trained via a convolutional sparse auto-encoder, specifically designed for extracting complex features from Chinese characters. In particular, the text structure component detectors enhance the accuracy and uniqueness of feature descriptors by extracting multiple text structure components in various ways. The spatial pyramid layer enhances the scale invariability of the CNN for detecting texts in multiple scales. Finally, the multi-input-layer DBN replaces the fully connected layers in the CNN to ensure features from multiple scales are comparable. A multilingual text detection dataset, in which texts in Chinese, English, and digits are labeled separately, is set up to evaluate the proposed text detection algorithm. The proposed algorithm shows a significant performance improvement over the baseline CNN algorithms. In addition the proposed algorithm is evaluated over a public multilingual benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art result under multiple languages. Furthermore, a simplified version of the proposed algorithm with only general components is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 and 2013 datasets, showing comparable detection performance to the existing general text detection algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Convolutional Neural Network-Based Chinese Text Detection Algorithm via Text Structure Modeling","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2016.2625259","startPage":"506","endPage":"518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2016.2625259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7855855/07733055.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Convolutional Neural Network-Based Chinese Text Detection Algorithm via Text Structure Modeling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7733055/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16669321","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1001003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61521062 and 61527804"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Science and Technology Committees of Scientific Research Project","grantNumber":"14XD1402100 and 15JC1401700"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Convolutional Neural Network-Based Chinese Text Detection Algorithm via Text Structure Modeling","sourcePdf":"tmm-ren-2625259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104761S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7855855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7855855","articleId":"7733055","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7733056,"authors":[{"name":"Xinying Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves (MoE), Fudan University, Shanghai, China","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Xinying","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1429-5439","id":"37406889700"},{"name":"Jianjun Yu","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278392400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7733056","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":542},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical attenuators","Wireless communication","Optical transmitters","Optical mixing","Optical polarization","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","forward error correction","free-space optical communication","least mean squares methods","light coherence","millimetre waves","optical information processing","optical modulation","optical receivers","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-carrier PDM-64QAM modulated wireless millimeter-wave signal delivery","large-tap decision-directed least-mean-square equalization","optical receiver digital signal processing","soft-decision FEC threshold","hard-decision forward-error-correction threshold","bit-error ratio","heterodyne coherent detection","high-level polarization-division-multiplexing 64-ary quadrature-amplitude modulation","spectral-efficient large-capacity single-carrier radio-overfiber system","bandwidth 33 GHz to 50 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photonic vector millimeter-wave (mm-wave) signal generation","64-ary quadrature-amplitude modulation (64QAM)","decision-directed least-mean-square (DD-LMS) equalization","Q-band"]}],"abstract":"We experimentally demonstrate a hardwareand spectral-efficient large-capacity single-carrier radio-overfiber system at Q-band (33-50 GHz), employing high-level polarization-division-multiplexing 64-ary quadrature-amplitudemodulation (PDM-64QAM) modulation and heterodyne coherent detection.

In this paper, electrothermal simulation in 3-D RRAM arrays is performed by using our in-house developed finite difference algorithm, which is validated by comparing the simulated temperature distribution with its counterpart obtained by commercial software. Both crossbar RRAM array and vertical RRAM array are studied comprehensively with careful consideration of the temperature-dependent constitute parameters. Simulations show that the temperature and thermal crosstalk are sensitive to the size and shape of conductive filament, which can further limit the scaling potential of RRAM array through affecting its reliability, such as retention time, current leakage, and so on. Scaling behavior of 3-D RRAM array is studied, and optimization guidance for reducing thermal crosstalk is proposed. The fabrication inaccuracy resulted cell offset has also been examined for investigation of thermal crosstalk.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2016.2615864","startPage":"4720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7739934/07733060.pdf","endPage":"4728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2016.2615864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733060/","displayDocTitle":"Electrothermal Characterization in 3-D Resistive Random Access Memory Arrays","volume":"63","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733060/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16486083","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61431014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrothermal Characterization in 3-D Resistive Random Access Memory Arrays","sourcePdf":"ted-yin-2615864-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121768S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7739934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7739934","articleId":"7733060","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7733062,"authors":[{"name":"Zarheer Jooma","affiliation":["e-Hazard.com, Vaalpark, South Africa","University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/7880726/7733062/jooma-2624745-small.gif","p":["Zarheer Jooma is currently working toward the Post Graduate degree on\n the effectiveness of the application of the incident investigation process for electrical incidents at the University\n of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.","He is the Director of the South African branch of the U.S.-based company e-Hazard.com.

Because wind power forecasting error is unavoidable, probabilistic forecasting becomes critical to accurately quantifying the uncertainty involved in traditional point forecasts of wind power and to providing meaningful information to conduct risk management in power system operation. This paper proposes a novel direct quantile regression approach to efficiently generate nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation combining extreme learning machine and quantile regression. Quantiles with different proportions can be directly produced via an innovatively formulated linear programming optimization model, without dependency on point forecasts. Multistep probabilistic forecasting of 10-min wind power is newly carried out based on real wind farm data from Bornholm Island in Denmark. The superiority of the proposed approach is verified through comparisons with other well-established benchmarks. The proposed approach forms a new artificial neural network-based nonparametric forecasting framework for wind power with high efficiency, reliability, and flexibility, which can be beneficial to various decision-making activities in power systems.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/59/7951114/7733064-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","volume":"32","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16969880","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7733064/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Direct Quantile Regression for Nonparametric Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2014AA051901"},{"fundingName":"International S&T Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2014DFG62670"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M580097"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51261130472 and 51577096"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC Theme Based Research Scheme","grantNumber":"T23-407/13-N and T23-701/14N"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Direct Quantile Regression for Nonparametric Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wang-2625101-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101067S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7951114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"7951114","articleId":"7733064","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7733065,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Bisplinghoff","affiliation":["Cisco Optical GmbH, Nuremberg, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Andreas Bisplinghoff was born in Forchheim, Germany, in 1984.

These goals are supported by using high baud rates, spectrally efficient modulation, and low-power solutions. Allowing independent design of non-binary modulation and binary forward error correction (FEC) coding, bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) eases the system design for software-defined reach (or capacity) by combining a programmable modulation with a single binary FEC code. Unfortunately, as we demonstrate, the suboptimality of BICM implementations tends to increase both with the higher modulation order and also the higher FEC overhead. This motivates a search for alternatives to BICM. In this paper, we examine a low-power multilevel coding architecture for higher order quadrature amplitude modulation (M- QAM). Limiting ourselves to non-iterative low-power solutions, we show that two-level coding using a low-complexity convolutional code concatenated with a powerful hard decoded FEC may be an attractive approach. We demonstrate a pilot-free, phase-slip tolerant inner coding scheme with low complexity, attractive performance, and low latency. In a real-time prototype, we study the performance and implementation aspects for 64 QAM, resulting in 12.9 dB net coding gain with less than 1 W power dissipation per coded 100 G in 14 nm ASIC technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733065/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2017","publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16721657","volume":"35","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power, Phase-Slip Tolerant, Multilevel Coding for <i>M-</i>QAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power, Phase-Slip Tolerant, Multilevel Coding for <italic>M-</italic>QAM","sourcePdf":"jlt-bisplinghoff-2625047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074599S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7869244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7869244","articleId":"7733065","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7733074,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Lorenzen","affiliation":["Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/7956378/7733074/loren-2625048-small.gif","p":["Matthias Lorenzen received the M.S. degree (Dipl.-Ing.) in\n engineering cybernetics from the University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany, in 2013 and is currently pursuing the\n Ph.D. degree in the Graduate School of Simulation Technology, Stuttgart Research Centre for Simulation Technology,\n Stuttgart, Germany.","During his studies he spent one year as DAAD Fellow at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.

In scenarios where the deployed chargers are static, we generally require a number of chargers to work simultaneously. However, due to the radio interference among different wireless chargers, scheduling these chargers is generally necessary. This scheduling problem is challenging since each charger's charging utility cannot be calculated independently due to the nonlinear superposition charging effect caused by radio interference. In this paper, based on the concurrent charging model, we formulate the concurrent charging scheduling problem (CCSP) with the objective of quickly fully charging all the sensor nodes. After proving the NP-hardness of CCSP, we propose two efficient greedy algorithms, and give the approximation ratio of one of them. Both the two greedy algorithms' performances are very close to that of a well-designed genetic algorithm (GA) which performs almost as well as a brute force algorithm at small network and charger scale. However, the running time of the two greedy algorithms is far lower than that of the GA. We conduct extensive simulations and specially implemented a testbed for wireless chargers. The results verified the good performance of the proposed algorithms.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7755/8000754/7733076-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","volume":"16","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"17149440","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7733076/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Concurrently Wireless Charging Sensor Networks with Efficient Scheduling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61272053, 61572217 and 61572218"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Concurrently Wireless Charging Sensor Networks with Efficient Scheduling","sourcePdf":"tmc-liu-2624731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109109S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8000754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8000754","articleId":"7733076","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7733080,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbo Shi","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Northeastern University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7733080/shi-2624558-small.gif","p":["Wenbo Shi received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Inha University, Incheon, South Korea, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.

It has excellent control over capacitor voltages and mitigates low-frequency oscillations in the neutral point for the full PF range. First, an investigation is made to see how the load currents get modulated to generate compensating neutral current causing charging and discharging of dc-link capacitors. It is observed that when an additional modulating voltage signal that is in phase with the corresponding phase current is added in each phase, a neutral current is produced in the right direction which can be used to compensate for any prior unbalance in capacitor voltages. It is demonstrated that the performance of this scheme is insensitive to the load PF variation (full range from zero to unity). It performs satisfactorily throughout the entire linear modulation range and eliminates any undesirable low-frequency harmonic component in the compensating neutral current. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through simulation and experimental results by varying load PF as well as modulation index with both passive and motor loads.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Capacitors","Voltage control","Pulse width modulation","Switches","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","power capacitors","power factor","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier-based PWM scheme","neutral point voltage balancing","three-level inverter","full power factor range","uniform convergence time","pulse width modulation strategy","capacitor voltages","low-frequency oscillation mitigation","load currents","dc-link capacitors","voltage signal modulation","load PF variation","linear modulation range","modulation index","passive loads","motor loads"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitor voltage balancing","carrier-based pulse width modulation (CBPWM)","neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter","zero-sequence signal"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2624721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7849237/07733084.pdf","startPage":"1873","endPage":"1883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2624721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Carrier-Based PWM Scheme for Neutral Point Voltage Balancing in Three-Level Inverter Extending to Full Power Factor Range","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Carrier-Based PWM Scheme for Neutral Point Voltage Balancing in Three-Level Inverter Extending to Full Power Factor Range","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733084/","volume":"64","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7733084/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16668339","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Carrier-Based PWM Scheme for Neutral Point Voltage Balancing in Three-Level Inverter Extending to Full Power Factor Range","sourcePdf":"tie-giri-2624721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098531S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7849237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"7849237","articleId":"7733084","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":7733085,"authors":[{"name":"Zilong Liu","affiliation":["School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7849237/7733085/liu-2625241-small.gif","p":["Zilong Liu received the B.S. degree in electronic science and\n technology from Huazhong Unversity of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2012, where he is currently working\n toward the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering in the School of Optical and Electronic Information.","His current research interests include digital integrated circuits, hardware security, and cryptography."]},"firstName":"Zilong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085385310"},{"name":"Dongsheng Liu","affiliation":["School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7849237/7733085/dliu-2625241-small.gif","p":["Dongsheng Liu (M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree from Huazhong\n University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2007, for his thesis on passive RFID tag ICs.","Since 2011, he has been an Associate Professor in the School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong\n University of Science and Technology.

It is important for the ECC processor to support a variety of ECC standards to be compatible with different security applications. Thus, a flexible processor which can support different standards and algorithms is desired. In this paper, an efficient and flexible dual-field ECC processor using the hardware-software approach is presented. The proposed processor can support arbitrary elliptic curve. An elaborate modular arithmetic logic unit is designed. It can perform basic modular arithmetic operations and achieve high efficiency. Based on our designed instruction set, the processor can be programmed to perform various point operations based on different algorithms. To demonstrate the flexibility of our processor, a point multiplication algorithm with power analysis resistance is adopted. Our design is implemented in the field-programmable gate array platform and also in the application-specified integrated circuit. After implemented in the 55 nm CMOS process, the processor takes between 0.60 ms (163 bits ECC) and 6.75 ms (571 bits ECC) to finish one-point multiplication. Compared to other related works, the merits of our ECC processor are the high hardware efficiency and flexibility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"64","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16668363","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7733085/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient and Flexible Hardware Implementation of the Dual-Field Elliptic Curve Cryptographic Processor","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61306038 and 61376031"},{"fundingName":"ChenGuang Project of Science and Technology for Wuhan youths","grantNumber":"2013072304010829"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015TS048"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient and Flexible Hardware Implementation of the Dual-Field Elliptic Curve Cryptographic Processor","sourcePdf":"tie-liu-2625241-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098109S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7849237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7849237","articleId":"7733085","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7733086,"authors":[{"name":"Erchan Aptoula","affiliation":["Gebze Technical University, Gebze, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erchan","lastName":"Aptoula","orcid":"0000-0001-6168-2883","id":"37572058800"},{"name":"Murat Can Ozdemir","affiliation":["Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat Can","lastName":"Ozdemir","id":"37086209146"},{"name":"Berrin Yanikoglu","affiliation":["Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Berrin","lastName":"Yanikoglu","id":"37621039700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"7733086","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":85,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1996},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733086","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Machine learning","Feature extraction","Neural networks","Gray-scale"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","neural nets","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral remote sensing dataset","convolutional neural network","feature extraction","spectral properties","arbitrary geometric properties","hyperspectral remote sensing image classification","deep learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attribute profiles (APs)","deep learning","hyperspectral images","mathematical morphology","pixel classification"]}],"abstract":"Effective spatial-spectral pixel description is of crucial significance for the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images. Attribute profiles are considered as one of the most prominent approaches in this regard, since they can capture efficiently arbitrary geometric and spectral properties. Lately though, the advent of deep learning in its various forms has also led to remarkable classification performances by operating directly on hyperspectral input. In this letter, we explore the collaboration potential of these two powerful feature extraction approaches. Specifically, we propose a new strategy for hyperspectral image classification, where attribute filtered images are stacked and provided as input to convolutional neural networks. Our experiments with two real hyperspectral remote sensing data sets show that the proposed strategy leads to a performance improvement, as opposed to using each of the involved approaches individually.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2016.2619354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2016.2619354","startPage":"1970","endPage":"1974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7778340/07733086.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning With Attribute Profiles for Hyperspectral Image Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning With Attribute Profiles for Hyperspectral Image Classification","volume":"13","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16552485","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733086/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TUBITAK","grantNumber":"112E210"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning With Attribute Profiles for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"lgrs-aptoula-2619354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068229S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7778340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7778340","articleId":"7733086","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7733091,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Jun Park","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 110-745, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7909058/7733091/park-2623812-small.gif","p":["Young-Jun Park received the B.S degree in electronics engineering\n from Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, South Korea, in 2013.

The proposed dc-dc buck converter is capable of handling loads from 10 \u03bcA to 20 mA with high efficiency by applying triple mode (retention mode, PFM mode, and PWM mode), gate split technique, and AZCD. Retention mode is proposed to extend wide load range at ultralight load. Gate split technique adjusts the conduction loss and switching loss. AZCD reduces the operation duty of the high-speed comparator and avoid reverse current below light load. In IoT applications, each node communicates with other nodes through a Bluetooth low energy transceiver, which consumes very low current and is highly sensitive to supply noise. Therefore, the proposed dc-dc buck converter adopts the SSCG technique to reduce electromagnetic interference by up to 18 dB.

This tutorial is distinguished by its depth with respect to wireless communication details and its focus on cellular networks. This paper starts by modeling and analyzing the baseband interference in a baseline single-tier downlink cellular network with single antenna base stations and universal frequency reuse. Then, it characterizes signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio and its related performance metrics. In particular, a unified approach to conduct error probability, outage probability, and transmission rate analysis is presented. Although the main focus of this paper is on cellular networks, the presented unified approach applies for other types of wireless networks that impose interference protection around receivers. This paper then extends the unified approach to capture cellular network characteristics (e.g., frequency reuse, multiple antenna, power control, etc.). It also presents numerical examples associated with demonstrations and discussions. To this end, this paper highlights the state-of-the-art research and points out future research directions.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/9739/7862305/7733098-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733098/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2017","volume":"19","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16691068","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7733098/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Cellular Networks Using Stochastic Geometry: A Tutorial","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004052","fundingName":"Sensor Research Initiative through the Office of Sponsored Research at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1525705"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Cellular Networks Using Stochastic Geometry: A Tutorial","sourcePdf":"comst-elsawy-2624939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.4347S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7862305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"248","xplore-issue":"7862305","articleId":"7733098","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7733099,"authors":[{"name":"Carmine Garripoli","affiliation":["Mixed-Signal Microelectronics Group, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, MB, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/7879373/7733099/garri-2616723-small.gif","p":["Carmine Garripoli was born in Locri, Italy, in 1989.

In the subcarrier allocation stage, hysteretic noisy chaotic neural network (HNCNN) with a newly established energy function is proposed for subcarrier allocation to improve the optimization performance and reduce the computational complexity. Activation functions with both anticlockwise and clockwise hysteretic loops are applied to the HNCNN. A new energy function is established for an objective function, which can be calculated offline, resulting in a lower computational complexity in solving subcarrier allocation than the previous energy function. In the power allocation stage, the water-filling algorithm is employed to attain optimal power allocation. Simulation results show that the energy function established in this paper can decrease the runtimes of the neural networks, and that the HNCNN with both anticlockwise and clockwise hysteretic-loop activation functions can improve probabilities of feasible and optimal solutions at higher noises. The two-stage algorithm in this paper outperforms the previous algorithms in fairness, system throughput, and resource utilization.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8262690/07733106.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2618898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2618898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8262690","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hysteretic Noisy Chaotic Neural Networks for Resource Allocation in OFDMA System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Neurons","Optimization","Biological neural networks","Throughput","Computational complexity","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic communication","computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","neural nets","OFDM modulation","probability","resource allocation","simulated annealing","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity reduction","energy function","optimization performance","anticlockwise hysteretic loops","water-filling algorithm","clockwise hysteretic loops","subcarrier allocation stage","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access system","two-stage resource allocation","OFDMA system","hysteretic noisy chaotic neural network","two-stage algorithm","hysteretic-loop activation functions","optimal power allocation","power allocation stage","objective function","HNCNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational complexity","energy function","hysteretic noisy chaotic neural network (HNCNN)","objective function","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Hysteretic Noisy Chaotic Neural Networks for Resource Allocation in OFDMA System","volume":"29","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7733106/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17519483","pubMedId":"27834654","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61100103"},{"fundingName":"Program for Young Backbone Teachers of the Heilongjiang Education Department","grantNumber":"1254G065"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hysteretic Noisy Chaotic Neural Networks for Resource Allocation in OFDMA System","sourcePdf":"tnnls-sun-2618898-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101458S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8262690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","xplore-issue":"8262690","articleId":"7733106","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7733110,"authors":[{"name":"Ge Wang","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7733110/wang-2624938-small.gif","p":["Ge Wang (F\u201903) received the Ph.D. degree in ECE, SUNY at Buffalo, NY, USA.

This paper summarizes impedance matching methods reported in the literature and gives a theoretical analysis on dc-dc converter for impedance matching in a WPT system. A buck-boost converter in discontinuous conduction mode has the characteristic of that the input resistance is independent of the load resistance and the input voltage, which seems to be suitable for impedance matching. Furthermore, the impedance matching ability of buck-boost converter will not depend on the frequency of rectifier, because it implements the solution to the dc output of rectifier. To verify those, we give several application examples of this buck-boost converter applied in rectifiers with different frequencies, such as 2.45, 5.8, and 24 GHz. As a result, those rectifiers with the buck-boost converter achieve a constant RF-dc conversion efficiency over an extremely wide load range. In addition, it is also successfully utilized in a microwave power transmission system for driving a dc motor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16652152","htmlLink":"/document/7733117/","displayDocTitle":"Impedance Matching in Wireless Power Transfer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impedance Matching in Wireless Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tmtt-huang-2618921-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119646S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7847453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7847453","articleId":"7733117","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":7733125,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Long Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/8002744/7733125/wang-2617321-small.gif","p":["Yu-Long Wang (M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in computer science and technology from Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, China, in 2000, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control science and engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.","He was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow and a Senior Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, QLD, Australia, and an Academic Visitor with the University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.

It is shown through heading control and rudder oscillation reduction performance analysis that compared with the controller design without dropping control input packets purposely, the proposed intentional packet dropouts-based controller design is more effective in improving the control performance of the USV.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2016.2617321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/8002744/07733125.pdf","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2016.2617321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8002744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-Based Heading Control and Rudder Oscillation Reduction for Unmanned Surface Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733125/","displayDocTitle":"Network-Based Heading Control and Rudder Oscillation Reduction for Unmanned Surface Vehicles","volume":"25","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17136313","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7733125/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP160103567"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374063 and 61403170"},{"fundingName":"333 Project Research Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China","grantNumber":"BRA2015358"},{"fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project of Jiangsu Province, China","grantNumber":"DZXX-025"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China","grantNumber":"BK20161361"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-Based Heading Control and Rudder Oscillation Reduction for Unmanned Surface Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tcst-han-2617321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09961S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"8002744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8002744","articleId":"7733125","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7733128,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyang Wang","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/7812805/7733128/wang-2624734-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyang Wang received the BSc and MSc degrees in computer science\n from Northeastern University, China, in 2010 and 2012, respectively, and the PhD degree from the University of New\n South Wales, Australia, in 2016.

Given a positive integer k, a social network g and a certain propagation model, it aims to find a set of k nodes that have the largest influence spread. The state-of-the-art method IMM is based on the reverse influence sampling (RIS) framework. By using the martingale technique, it greatly outperforms the previous methods in efficiency. However, IMM still has limitations in scalability due to the high overhead of deciding a tight sample size. In this paper, instead of spending the effort on deciding a tight sample size, we present a novel bottom-ksketch based RIS framework, namely BKRIS, which brings the order of samples into the RIS framework. By applying the sketch technique, we can derive early termination conditions to significantly accelerate the seed set selection procedure. Moreover, we provide a cost-effective method to find a proper sample size to bound the quality of returned result. In addition, we provide several optimization techniques to reduce the cost of generating samples' order and efficiently deal with the worst-case scenario. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method over 10 real world datasets. Compared with the IMM approach, BKRIS can achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup with almost the same influence spread. In the largest dataset with 1.8 billion edges, BKRIS can return 50 seeds in 1.3 seconds and return 5,000 seeds in 36.6 seconds. It takes IMM 55.32 second and 3,664.97 seconds, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2016.2624734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2016.2624734","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/7812805/07733128.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7812805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733128/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Bring Order into the Samples: A Novel Scalable Method for Influence Maximization","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16636577","htmlLink":"/document/7733128/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2017","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000163","fundingName":"ARC","grantNumber":"DE140100679"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000163","fundingName":"ARC","grantNumber":"DP150103071, DP150102728 and NSFC61232006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000163","fundingName":"ARC ARC","grantNumber":"DP150102728 and DP140103578"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bring Order into the Samples: A Novel Scalable Method for Influence Maximization","sourcePdf":"tkde-wang-2624734-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159338S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"7812805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7812805","articleId":"7733128","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7733131,"authors":[{"name":"Weiqing Liu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China","Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7927510/7733131/liu-2624733-small.gif","p":["Weiqing Liu received the BE degree in computer science and technology\n from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), in 2011.

They utilize complex algorithms (e.g., machine learning) to provide advanced functions (e.g., object recognition), thus lead to long response time while running on mobile devices. To reduce the response time, researchers propose offloading some compute-intensive parts of mobile applications onto cloud. Existing works aim to optimize general performance (e.g., response time), but ignore the enhancement of application quality (e.g., recognition accuracy), which is also critical to user experience. In this paper, we develop AppBooster, a mobile cloud platform which boosts both general performance and application quality for interactive mobile applications. AppBooster jointly leverages the quality adaptation, computation offloading and parallel speedup to boost the comprehensive performance, which is defined by developers based on the metrics of application quality and general performance. Through combining history-based platform-learned knowledge, developer-provided information and the platform-monitored environment conditions (e.g., workload, network), AppBooster manages applications with optimal computation partitioning scheme and tunable parameter setting thus obtain high comprehensive performance. We evaluate AppBooster with an object recognition application in various network conditions and show AppBooster can significantly boost application performance and obtain 1.3 to 3.5 times better performance than existing strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2016.2624733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

method for single-channel blind separation of nonoverlapped sources and, to the best of our knowledge, apply it for the first time to automatic segmentation of lung tumors in positron emission tomography (PET) images. Our approach first converts a 3-D PET image into a pseudo-multichannel image. Afterward, regularization free sparseness constrained non-negative matrix factorization is used to separate tumor from other tissues. By using complexity based criterion, we select tumor component as the one with minimal complexity. We have compared the proposed method with threshold based on 40% and 50% maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), graph cuts (GC), random walks (RW), and affinity propagation (AP) algorithms on 18 nonsmall cell lung cancer datasets with respect to ground truth (GT) provided by two radiologists.

In the blue (friendly) network, an eavesdropping sensor node is deployed to capture data of the red (adversary) network, where the red network adopts cognitive radio for opportunistic data transmission. Since most wireless networks suffer energy constraints, we investigate the data capture (eavesdropping) performance of the blue network in two scenarios of energy management: no energy harvesting and energy harvesting. In both of the energy scenarios, we formulate the problem of maximizing data-capturing performance of blue network in the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) by considering feedback observations of actions. Furthermore, a recursive method is adopted to solve the problem by which the optimal action policy for the eavesdropping sensor nodes of blue network is obtained. Finally, we compare the performances of the proposed scheme with those of different reference methods under the two mentioned energy scenarios. Numerical results show that the proposed POMDP-based scheme can improve the data-capturing performance of the eavesdropping sensor node.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","volume":"17","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16524274","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7733139/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data Capture of Cognitive Radio-Based Red Network by a Blue Network in Tactical Wireless Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"MEST","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1A2A1A15053452"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Capture of Cognitive Radio-Based Red Network by a Blue Network in Tactical Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-koo-2624750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08425S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7778258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7778258","articleId":"7733139","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7733140,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos I.

The system operates under independent and nonidentically distributed rank-1 Rician fading channels with imperfect channel estimation and residual hardware impairments (compensation algorithms are assumed, which mitigate the main impairments) at the transceiver. The spatial multiplexing mode of operation is considered where all the users are simultaneously transmitting their streams to the receiver. Zero forcing is applied along with successive interference cancellation as a means for efficient detection of the received streams. New analytical closed-form expressions are derived for some important performance metrics, namely, the outage probability and ergodic capacity of the entire system.

Older, well-studied centralized control schemes where a single computational entity harvests channel information from individual clients in order to determine optimal resource allocations for each client is no longer tenable: such methods require significant signaling overhead which does not scale well with the expected number of hundreds of thousands of smart client devices with multiple radio interfaces capable of leveraging many different radio access technologies (RATs). With the rise of these smart devices, which come with significant computational power, it is now possible to ask the question: can the network allow the client control over RAT selection and association in order to meet some client-driven or network-driven objective, and to what degree does the network assist the client in making these choices? This question becomes particularly important given the increasing interest in standardization and deployment of client-controlled edge networking, or Fog networking. In this paper, we explore the spectrum of client-controlled HetNets for 5G networks: from the fully devolved distributed local control approach, where clients make local decisions without any assistance from the network, to the hybrid control approach where clients may make decisions given some global information provided by the network.","topic":"Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G Wireless Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733149/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","volume":"5","accessionNumber":"16772364","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2017","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7733149/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Client-Controlled HetNets for 5G","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Survey of Client-Controlled HetNets for 5G","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2624755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1269S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G Wireless Communications"],"articleId":"7733149","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7733150,"authors":[{"name":"Yansha Deng","affiliation":["King\u2019s College London, WC2R 2LS, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Yansha","lastName":"Deng","orcid":"0000-0003-1001-7036","id":"37085372750"},{"name":"Weisi Guo","affiliation":["University of Warwick, CV4 7AL, Coventry, U.K."],"firstName":"Weisi","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0003-3524-3953","id":"38261748300"},{"name":"Adam Noel","affiliation":["University of Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Noel","id":"38234830100"},{"name":"Arumugam Nallanathan","affiliation":["King\u2019s College London, WC2R 2LS, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Arumugam","lastName":"Nallanathan","id":"37269846800"},{"name":"Maged Elkashlan","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London, E1 4NS, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Maged","lastName":"Elkashlan","orcid":"0000-0002-5168-0160","id":"37269057400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7733150","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":888},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733150","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Error probability","Molecular communication","Artificial neural networks","Chemicals","Transmitters","Energy exchange"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical reactions","error statistics","molecular communication (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["molecular communication via diffusion","MCvD","energy efficient transportation paradigm","molecule propagation","information molecule synthesis process","simultaneous molecular information and energy transfer relay","emission molecules","absorbed molecules","chemical reactions","approximate closed-form expressions","bit error probability","synthesis cost","two-hop molecular communication system","particle-based simulation","SMIET relay system","molecule type conversion","molecule division"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Molecular communication","energy transfer","chemical reaction","SMIET relay"]}],"abstract":"Molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is inherently an energy efficient transportation paradigm, which requires no external energy during molecule propagation. Inspired by the fact that the emitted molecules have a finite probability to reach the receiver, this letter introduces an energy efficient scheme for the information molecule synthesis process of MCvD via a simultaneous molecular information and energy transfer (SMIET) relay. With this SMIET capability, the relay can decode the received information as well as generate its emission molecules using its absorbed molecules via chemical reactions. To reveal the advantages of SMIET, approximate closed-form expressions for the bit error probability and the synthesis cost of this two-hop molecular communication system are derived and then validated by particle-based simulation. Interestingly, by comparing with a conventional relay system, the SMIET relay system can be shown to achieve a lower minimum bit error probability via molecule division, and a lower synthesis cost via molecule type conversion or molecule division.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2624727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2624727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07733150.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Energy Efficient Molecular Communication via Molecule Energy Transfer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Energy Efficient Molecular Communication via Molecule Energy Transfer","volume":"21","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7733150/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16668401","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733150/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Energy Efficient Molecular Communication via Molecule Energy Transfer","sourcePdf":"lcomm-deng-2624727-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055788S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7733150","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7733152,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Geun Bae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Geun","lastName":"Bae","id":"37085709292"},{"name":"Gyungmin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Micro/Nano Systems, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gyungmin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086150870"},{"name":"Chulwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chulwoo","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0003-4379-7905","id":"37292328500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7733152","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1347},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Calibration","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Phase locked loops","Clocks","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","electromagnetic interference","field effect MMIC","low-power electronics","microwave oscillators","phase locked loops","phase noise","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subsampling phase-locked loop","SSPLL","spread-spectrum clock generator","frequency deviation calibration","low jitter performance","low in-band phase noise performance","direct voltage-controlled oscillator modulation","automatic calibration","electromagnetic interference reduction","CMOS process","frequency 5 GHz","power 7 mW","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Auto-calibration","spread-spectrum clock generator (SSCG)","subsampling phase-locked loop (SSPLL)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733152","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8048686/07733152.pdf","startPage":"1132","endPage":"1136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2624759","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2624759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 5-GHz Subsampling PLL-Based Spread-Spectrum Clock Generator by Calibrating the Frequency Deviation","abstract":"This brief presents a spread-spectrum clock generator (SSCG) based on a subsampling phase-locked loop (SSPLL) by calibrating the spreading ratio.

Since the complexity of maximum-likelihood (ML) data detection is prohibitive for such large wireless systems, approximate methods are necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel data detection algorithm referred to as Triangular Approximate SEmidefinite Relaxation (TASER), which is suitable for two application scenarios: i) coherent data detection in large multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems and ii) joint channel estimation and data detection in large single-input multiple-output (SIMO) wireless systems. For both scenarios, we show that TASER achieves near-ML error-rate performance at low complexity by relaxing the associated ML-detection problems into a semidefinite program, which we solve approximately using a preconditioned forward-backward splitting procedure. Since the resulting problem is non-convex, we provide convergence guarantees for our algorithm. To demonstrate the efficacy of TASER in practice, we design a systolic architecture that enables our algorithm to achieve high throughput at low hardware complexity, and we develop reference field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs for various antenna configurations.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2607198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2607198","startPage":"2334","endPage":"2346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7755810/07733153.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7755810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Detection in Large Multi-Antenna Wireless Systems via Approximate Semidefinite Relaxation","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8919/7755810/7733153-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Data Detection in Large Multi-Antenna Wireless Systems via Approximate Semidefinite Relaxation","volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16486581","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733153/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Data Detection in Large Multi-Antenna Wireless Systems via Approximate Semidefinite Relaxation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-studer-2607198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183766S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7755810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7755810","articleId":"7733153","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7733155,"authors":[{"name":"Debashis Banerjee","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology and is currently with NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA"],"bio":{"p":["Debashis Banerjee (M\u201911) received the B.E. degree in electronics and tele-communication engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, and the M.S. and PhD degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2007, 2013, and 2014 respectively.

It is also known that the optimal power control strategy depends on the process conditions corresponding to the RF devices concerned. This leads to an explosion in the search space needed to find the best feedback control strategy, across all combinations of channel conditions and receiver process corners, making simulation driven optimal control law design impractical and computationally infeasible. Since this problem is largely intractable due to the above complexity of simulation, we propose a self-learning strategy for adaptive RF systems. In this approach, RF devices learn their own performance vs. power consumption vs. tuning knob relationships \u201con-the-fly\u201d and formulate the most power-optimal control strategy for real-time adaptation of the RF system using neural-network based learning techniques during real-time operation. The methodology is demonstrated using SISO and MIMO RF receiver front-ends as test vehicles and is supported by hardware validation leading to 2.5X-3X power savings with minimal overhead.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8919/7809129/7733155-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733155/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16618479","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7733155/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Self-Learning RF Receiver Systems: Process Aware Real-Time Adaptation to Channel Conditions for Low Power Operation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF Grants","grantNumber":"CCF-1319935 and ECCS-1407542"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007245","fundingName":"MARCO","grantNumber":"GSRC-2009-DT-660"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Self-Learning RF Receiver Systems: Process Aware Real-Time Adaptation to Channel Conditions for Low Power Operation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-banerjee-2608962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155921S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7809129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7809129","articleId":"7733155","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7733156,"authors":[{"name":"Kelechi Hilary Anabi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7733156/anabi-2621178-small.gif","p":["Kelechi Hilary Anabi received the B.Tech. degree in electrical, electronic and systems engineering from the Institute of Management Technology, Enugu, Nigeria, in 2003, the M.B.A. degree in finance from the University of Ballarat, Australia, in 2009, and the master\u2019s degree in wireless communication from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Undeniably, TVWS technology is faced with daunting challenges that require attention. To enable an ecosystem in which TVWS technology can flourish, there is a need for a complete analysis of the challenges, trends and future research direction related to this technology. Database-assisted TVWS technology is market driven, geared toward the spectrum reuse paradigm, and faces fewer technical hurdles. Our goal in this paper is to present a tutorial review of the challenges related to database-assisted TVWS networks using the SLEPT (social, legal, economic, political, and technological) analysis framework. The SLEPT framework is a management model that is extensively used for quantitative analysis. A brief review of TVWS technology using the SLEPT model reveals that the technology has been socially accepted, legal challenges are evident in some countries, economic models are the way forward and are main focus of current research trends, TVWS technology cannot be implemented without political will emanating from spectrum reforms, and there are many coexistence-motivated technological issues confronting TVWS technology. In summary, this paper provides an up-to-date survey on TVWS and presents current trends and future research directions in the TVWS context.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","volume":"4","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"16568331","publicationDate":"2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733156/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Database-Assisted Television White Space Technology: Challenges, Trends and Future Research Directions","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003093","fundingName":"Malaysia\u2019s Ministry of Higher Education","grantNumber":"ERGS/1/2013/ICT03/UKM/02/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Database-Assisted Television White Space Technology: Challenges, Trends and Future Research Directions","sourcePdf":"access-anabi-2621178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.218193S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7733156","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7733158,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8172502/7733158/kyang-2624761-small.gif","p":["Kai Yang received the B.Eng. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, the M.S. degree from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, and the Ph.D. degree from Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.","He is a Professor and a National Young Thousand Talented Program Scholar with Tongji University, Shanghai, China.

It abstracts the RCA process into two modules, namely rule (fingerprint) learning and the module of AD and fingerprint matching. We first develop a rare association rule mining method to learn the symptoms of network anomalies and to build a fingerprint knowledge database from the historic data. Then a statistical machine learning approach is employed to identify the anomalies within the incoming dataset collected via various probes in the network and map the fingerprints of the detected anomalies to the rules in the knowledge database.

Recent research has shown that the perturbations of the radio-frequency (RF) signals commonly adopted for wireless communications can also be used as sensing tools for device-free human motion detection. Device-free RF-based human sensing applications range from tag-less body localization to detection and monitoring of human well-being (e-Health). In this paper, we propose a real-time system for human body motion sensing with special focus on joint body localization and fall detection. The proposed system continuously monitors and processes the RF signals emitted by industry-compliant radio devices operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and supporting machine-to-machine communication functions. Human-induced diffraction and multipath phenomena that affect RF signal propagation are leveraged for body localization while for fall detection a hidden Markov model is applied to discern different postures of the operator and to detect safety-relevant events by tracking the received signal strength indicator footprints. Fall detection performances are corroborated by extensive experimental measurements in different settings. In addition, we propose also a sensor fusion tool that is able to integrate the device-free RF-based sensing system within an industrial image sensors framework. Preliminary results, conducted during field trial measurements, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of localization accuracy, and sensitivity/specificity to correctly detect a fall event from preimpact postures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Device-Free RF Human Body Fall Detection and Localization in Industrial Workplaces","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2016.2624800","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7914795/07733160.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2016.2624800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7914795","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Device-Free RF Human Body Fall Detection and Localization in Industrial Workplaces","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7733160/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16838570","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche-Regione Lombardia projects, FIDEAS and CyberSort"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device-Free RF Human Body Fall Detection and Localization in Industrial Workplaces","sourcePdf":"jiot-kianoush-2624800-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086091S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7914795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7914795","articleId":"7733160","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7733162,"authors":[{"name":"Songyu Hu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7900484/7733162/hu-2624753-small.gif","p":["Songyu Hu received the Ph.D. degree in robotics and automation from\n the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2011.","From 2011 to 2013, he was a Design Engineer in Huawei Technologies Co.

In this study, an enabling technology is proposed for simultaneous automated transportation of multiple cell types utilizing a robot-aided cell manipulation system equipped with holographic optical tweezers. The dynamics of a trapped cell is initially analyzed. A control constraint is introduced to confine the offset of cells within the optical trap to prevent cells from escaping the trap during transportation. Unlike existing methods determining the critical offset through manual calibration for only a particular cell type, this proposed approach can automatically derive and apply the control constraint to multiple cell types with different radii. A controller is then developed for automated transportation of multiple cell types with different sizes in which exact values of model parameters, such as trapping stiffness and drag coefficient, are not required. Experiments are finally performed on the transportation of yeast cells and osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2016.2624753","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7900484/07733162.pdf","startPage":"804","endPage":"814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2016.2624753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Transportation of Multiple Cell Types Using a Robot-Aided Cell Manipulation System With Holographic Optical Tweezers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Automated Transportation of Multiple Cell Types Using a Robot-Aided Cell Manipulation System With Holographic Optical Tweezers","volume":"22","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16808517","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7733162/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733162/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007219","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of SZU","grantNumber":"201443"},{"fundingName":"Seed Funding from the Scientific and Technical Innovation Council of Shenzhen Government","grantNumber":"JCYJ20150625102859322"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51577120 and 81300028"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"CityU11210135"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Transportation of Multiple Cell Types Using a Robot-Aided Cell Manipulation System With Holographic Optical Tweezers","sourcePdf":"tmech-sun-2624753-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122195S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7900484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7900484","articleId":"7733162","onlineDate":"03 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7733163,"authors":[{"name":"Shanmugam Lakshmanan","affiliation":["Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation, Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8244326/7733163/laksh-2619345-small.gif","p":["Shanmugam Lakshmanan was born in Salem, India, in 1985.

Then, using suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and Jensen's inequality, the synchronization criteria are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, a feedback controller is designed to attain synchronization between the master and slave models, and to ensure that the error model is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical examples and simulations are presented to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Besides that, an image encryption algorithm is proposed based on the piecewise linear chaotic map and the chaotic inertial neural network. The chaotic signals obtained from the inertial neural network are utilized for the encryption process. Statistical analyses are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed encryption algorithm.

It is shown that the proposed modification improves the prediction ability of the PNN classifier.","startPage":"97","endPage":"103","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593664/7733200/07733221.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modification of the probabilistic neural network with the use of sensitivity analysis procedure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Sensitivity","Kernel","Support vector machines","Training","Probabilistic logic","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification","pattern clustering","radial basis function networks","sensitivity analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified probabilistic neural network","MPNN","sensitivity analysis procedure","SA procedure","classification algorithm","support vector machine","multilayer perceptron","radial basis function network","k-means clustering","PNN classifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Modification of the probabilistic neural network with the use of sensitivity analysis procedure","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7733221/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16428727","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modification of the probabilistic neural network with the use of sensitivity analysis procedure","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093912S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593664","isNumber":"7733200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593664","xplore-issue":"7733200","articleId":"7733221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Polish Information Processing Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7733228,"authors":[{"name":"Bart\u0142omiej Stasiak","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Lodz University of Technology, Poland"],"firstName":"Bart\u0142omiej","lastName":"Stasiak","id":"37085704610"},{"name":"J\u0119drzej Mo\u0144ko","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Lodz University of Technology, ul.

Our experiment employs voxel-based morphometry to extract the grey matter densities from 52 images of first-episode schizophrenia patients and 52 healthy controls. MLP and SVM are adapted on random feature vectors taken from predefined feature pool and the classification results are based on their voting. Random feature ensemble method improved prediction of schizophrenia when short input feature vector (100 features) was used, however the performance was comparable with single classifiers based on bigger input feature vector (1000 and 10000 features).","startPage":"317","endPage":"321","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593664/7733200/07733259.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random subspace ensemble artificial neural networks for first-episode schizophrenia classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Magnetic resonance imaging","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Feature extraction","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical computing","multilayer perceptrons","patient diagnosis","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random subspace ensemble artificial neural networks","first-episode schizophrenia classification","computer-aided schizophrenia diagnosis","random subspace ensemble method","multilayer perceptron","MLP","support vector machines","SVM","voxel-based morphometry","grey matter densities","random feature vectors","predefined feature pool","random feature ensemble method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Random subspace ensemble artificial neural networks for first-episode schizophrenia classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7733259/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16428685","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random subspace ensemble artificial neural networks for first-episode schizophrenia classification","confLoc":"Gdansk, Poland","sourcePdf":"333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072064S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593664","isNumber":"7733200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593664","xplore-issue":"7733200","articleId":"7733259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Polish Information Processing Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7733295,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Krzeszowski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rzeszow University of Technology, Rzesz\u00f3w"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Krzeszowski","id":"37077083600"},{"name":"Krzysztof Wiktorowicz","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rzeszow University of Technology, Rzesz\u00f3w"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wiktorowicz","id":"37085776023"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-3608-1090-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0046-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7733295","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Particle swarm optimization","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy sets","Heuristic algorithms","Takagi-Sugeno model","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy particle swarm optimization algorithms","nonfuzzy algorithm","inertia weight","cognitive coefficients","social components","nonlinear benchmark functions","objective function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733295","abstract":"This paper is devoted to an evaluation of selected fuzzy particle swarm optimization algorithms.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) a software application or a hardware is a security mechanism that is able to monitor network traffic and find abnormal activities in the network. Machine learning techniques which have an important role in detecting the attacks were mostly used in the development of IDS. Due to huge increase in network traffic and different types of attacks, monitoring each and every packet in the network traffic is time consuming and computational intensive. Deep learning acts as a powerful tool by which thorough packet inspection and attack identification is possible. The parallel computing capabilities of the neural network make the Deep Neural Network (DNN) to effectively look through the network traffic with an accelerated performance. In this paper an accelerated DNN architecture is developed to identify the abnormalities in the network data. NSL-KDD dataset is used to compute the training time and to analyze the effectiveness of the detection mechanism.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593665/7733490/07733515.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated deep neural networks for enhanced Intrusion Detection System","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated deep neural networks for enhanced Intrusion Detection System","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16428949","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733515/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated deep neural networks for enhanced Intrusion Detection System","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"ETFA2016_paper_145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09983S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593665","isNumber":"7733490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593665","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"7733490","articleId":"7733515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7733534,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Zurita","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Zurita","id":"37078045900"},{"name":"Enric Sala","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Terrassa, Spain"],"firstName":"Enric","lastName":"Sala","id":"37085365546"},{"name":"Jes\u00fas A.

Time-series forecasting of critical industrial signals presents itself as a way to reduce this impact by extracting knowledge regarding the internal dynamics of the process and advice any process deviations before it affects the productive process. In this paper, a novel industrial condition monitoring approach based on the combination of Self Organizing Maps for operating point codification and Recurrent Neural Networks for critical signal modeling is proposed. The combination of both methods presents a strong synergy, the information of the operating condition given by the interpretation of the maps helps the model to improve generalization, one of the drawbacks of recurrent networks, while assuring high accuracy and precision rates. Finally, the complete methodology, in terms of performance and effectiveness is validated experimentally with real data from a copper rod industrial plant.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733534","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593665/7733490/07733534.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Industrial process monitoring by means of recurrent neural networks and Self Organizing Maps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Industrial process monitoring by means of recurrent neural networks and Self Organizing Maps","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16428980","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733534/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Industrial process monitoring by means of recurrent neural networks and Self Organizing Maps","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"ETFA2016_paper_169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127151S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593665","isNumber":"7733490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593665","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7733490","articleId":"7733534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7733543,"authors":[{"name":"Shehzad A.

It also contributed to increase the popularity and availability of software libraries developed for embedded systems, such as Intels MRAA and its higher-level version UPM. Besides this evolution, the design of embedded systems that requires controlling complex physical devices (namely Cyber-Physical Systems - CPS) still needs attention from the research community. Model Driven Engineering has been applied as a possible solution to help the development of these highly complex systems. However, analyzing the existing MDE design tools, it is observed that there is a little support to the automated design of the sensing and actuation subsystems. For this reason, the present paper provides a MDE solution that allows the designers to represent and integrate the sensing and actuation subsystems on the applications, using as input a sensors and actuators library and a functional specification of the control system. The proposed approach applies a transformation process that aims to guide the designer to bind the control specification to the proper sensors and actuators belonging to the library. The tool named ECPSModeling was developed to support the proposed activities, as detailed along the paper. The design of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is used to illustrate the proposed approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Actuators","Analytical models","Mathematical model","Software packages","Embedded systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyber-physical systems","design engineering","sensors","software libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UAV","unmanned aerial vehicle","ECPSModeling","control specification","transformation process","control system functional specification","actuators library","sensors","MDE design tools","highly complex systems development","cyber-physical systems","complex physical devices control","UPM","Intels MRAA","software libraries","embedded systems design","low-cost embedded platforms","sensing and actuation subsystems designing","model driven engineering approach"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733566","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593665/7733490/07733566.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model driven engineering approach to design sensing and actuation subsystems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model driven engineering approach to design sensing and actuation subsystems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733566/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7733566/","accessionNumber":"16428750","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model driven engineering approach to design sensing and actuation subsystems","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"ETFA2016_paper_208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084439S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593665","isNumber":"7733490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593665","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7733490","articleId":"7733566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7733574,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Faragardi","affiliation":["M\u00e4lardalen University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Faragardi","id":"38489598800"},{"name":"Aboozar Rajabi","affiliation":["School of ECE, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Aboozar","lastName":"Rajabi","id":"37075125400"},{"name":"Kristian Sandstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["M\u00e4lardalen University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Kristian","lastName":"Sandstr\u00f6m","id":"37282310400"},{"name":"Thomas Nolte","affiliation":["M\u00e4lardalen University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Nolte","id":"37298874100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1314-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1313-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1315-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7733574","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733574","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","energy consumption","power aware computing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication network","deadline miss ratio","timing violations","energy consumption minimization","RTC","strict timing guarantee","cloud computing system","real-time requirements","video gaming","multimedia","telecommunication","cloud applications","environmental impacts","operational cost","service cost","computing resources","communication resources","cost-effective services","real-time cloud services","energy-aware resource provisioning algorithm","EAICA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["real-time cloud services","resource provisioning","quality of service","energy-aware scheduling","communication-aware allocation"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is receiving an increasing attention when it comes to providing a wide range of cost-effective services. In this context, energy consumption of communication and computing resources contribute to a major portion of the cost of services. On the other hand, growing energy consumption not only results in a higher operational cost, but it also causes negative environmental impacts. A large number of cloud applications in, e.g., telecommunication, multimedia, and video gaming, have real-time requirements. A cloud computing system hosting such applications, that requires a strict timing guarantee for its provided services, is denoted a Real-Time Cloud (RTC). Minimizing energy consumption in a RTC is a complicated task as common methods that are used for decreasing energy consumption can potentially lead to timing violations. In this paper, we present an online energy-aware resource provisioning framework to reduce the deadline miss ratio for real-time cloud services. The proposed provisioning framework not only considers the energy consumption of servers but it also takes the energy consumption of the communication network into account, to provide a holistic solution. An extensive range of simulation results, based on real data, show a noticeable improvement regarding energy consumption while keeping the number of timing violations less than 1% in average.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733574","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593665/7733490/07733574.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EAICA: An energy-aware resource provisioning algorithm for Real-Time Cloud services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"EAICA: An energy-aware resource provisioning algorithm for Real-Time Cloud services","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16428767","htmlLink":"/document/7733574/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EAICA: An energy-aware resource provisioning algorithm for Real-Time Cloud services","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"ETFA2016_paper_216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088982S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593665","isNumber":"7733490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593665","xplore-issue":"7733490","articleId":"7733574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7733579,"authors":[{"name":"Yingbing Hua","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Yingbing","lastName":"Hua","id":"37085897984"},{"name":"Stefan Zander","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Haid-und-Neu-Strasse 10-14, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Zander","id":"37085681666"},{"name":"Mirko Bordignon","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Mirko","lastName":"Bordignon","id":"37568716100"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Hein","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Hein","id":"37604448500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1314-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1313-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1315-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7733579","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":901},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Service robots","Unified modeling language","Semantics","Software","Automation","Ontologies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial robots","inference mechanisms","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","operating systems (computers)","production engineering computing","robot programming","semantic Web","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AutomationML","ROS","software engineering","industrial robotics","ontological reasoning","software development","inference framework","robot operating system","production system","semantic Web technologies","model-to-text transformation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733579","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733490","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593665/7733490/07733579.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From AutomationML to ROS: A model-driven approach for software engineering of industrial robotics using ontological reasoning","abstract":"One of the major investment for applying industrial robots in production resides in the software development, which is an interdisciplinary and heterogeneous engineering process.

By applying model-to-text transformation techniques, executable ROS code can be generated from the models that foster fast prototyping and the reuse of robotic software.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733579/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16428771","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"From AutomationML to ROS: A model-driven approach for software engineering of industrial robotics using ontological reasoning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From AutomationML to ROS: A model-driven approach for software engineering of industrial robotics using ontological reasoning","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"ETFA2016_paper_222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07115S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593665","isNumber":"7733490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593665","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7733490","articleId":"7733579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7733618,"authors":[{"name":"Takao Sato","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takao","lastName":"Sato","id":"37335824100"},{"name":"Takahiro Honda","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Honda","id":"37085891711"},{"name":"Nozomu Araki","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nozomu","lastName":"Araki","id":"37404571600"},{"name":"Yasuo Konishi","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuo","lastName":"Konishi","id":"37334329700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1314-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1313-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1315-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7733618","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Tuning","Design methodology","Mathematical model","Data models","MIMO","MISO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","multivariable control systems","optimisation","sampled data systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven dual-rate control system","TITO method","dual-rate control system design","plant output sampling interval","noniterative correlation-based tuning","controller parameter optimization","SISO dual-rate control system","multiinput single ouput single-rate control system","MISO single-rate control system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733618","abstract":"In the present study, we propose a design method for a dual-rate control system, in which the sampling interval of the plant output is twice the hold interval of the control input.

Wireless systems are considered to provide numerous advantages over wired systems in industrial applications for example. However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, such systems are prone to a wide range of cyber attacks. These range from passive eavesdropping attacks to active attacks like data manipulation or masquerade attacks. Therefore it is necessary to provide reliable and efficient security mechanisms. One of the most important security issue in such a system is to ensure integrity as well as authenticity of exchanged messages over the air between communicating devices in order to prohibit active attacks. In the present work, an approach on how to achieve this goal in MC-MTC systems based on Physical Layer Security (PHYSEC), especially a new method based on keeping track of channel variations, will be presented and a proof-of-concept evaluation is given.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593665/7733490/07733691.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733490","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing Physical Layer Security for Mission Critical Machine Type Communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Microwave integrated circuits","Payloads","Security","Transmitters","Communication system security","IEEE 802.15 Standard"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mission critical machine type communication","physical layer security","wireless systems","wired systems","industrial applications","wireless channel","cyber attacks","passive eavesdropping attacks","exchanged message authenticity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Providing Physical Layer Security for Mission Critical Machine Type Communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7733691/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16428974","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing Physical Layer Security for Mission Critical Machine Type Communication","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"ETFA2016_paper_377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045334S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593665","isNumber":"7733490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593665","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7733490","articleId":"7733691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7733724,"authors":[{"name":"Malte Strop","affiliation":["Chair of Design and Drive Technology (KAt), Paderborn University, Paderborn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany"],"firstName":"Malte","lastName":"Strop","id":"37085891779"},{"name":"Detmar Zimmer","affiliation":["Chair of Design and Drive Technology (KAt), Paderborn University, Paderborn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany"],"firstName":"Detmar","lastName":"Zimmer","id":"37702295700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1314-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1313-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1315-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7733724","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Induction motors","Rubber","Permanent magnet motors","Synchronous motors","Process control","Mixers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drives","learning (artificial intelligence)","mechanical engineering computing","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent operating strategy","internal rubber mixer","multimotor drive system","artificial neural network","optimal torque distributions","optimization","machine learning","self-learning drive system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733724","abstract":"Multi-Motor Drive Systems (MMDS) consist of multiple motors that act together to fulfill one drive task.

Experimental results proved that this method has a faster convergence rate and a higher precision in inertia identification, confirmed effectiveness and feasibility of this method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSGEA.2016.49","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605060/7733774/07733789.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"25","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Smart Grid and Electrical Automation (ICSGEA)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Smart Grid and Electrical Automation (ICSGEA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSGEA.2016.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Inertia Identification Method for Servo System Using Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7733789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Inertia Identification Method for Servo System Using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16443466","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7733789/","conferenceDate":"11-12 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Inertia Identification Method for Servo System Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"5948a022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042317S","chronDate":"11-12 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605060","isNumber":"7733774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605060","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7733774","articleId":"7733789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7733803,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Rui-Hong","affiliation":["Shijiazhuang Vocational Technology Institute, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Rui-Hong","id":"37085906737"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3578-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3577-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3579-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7733803","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Algorithm design and analysis","Chemical processes","Job shop scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical engineering","chemical technology","Gaussian processes","iterative methods","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical production process optimization","improved particle swarm algorithm","Gaussian mutation","iteration process","global searching ability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chemical process optimization","particle swarm optimization","population diversity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7733803","abstract":"Optimization is an effective technique for improving the performance of chemical production process system which is a typical complex system.

It is thought that various types of traffic sign should be recognized to get more detailed information of road. In this paper, 6 types of traffic sign images are trained by LeNet-5 convolutional neural network architecture. In the detection phase, light-weight color-based segmentation algorithm and Hough transform algorithm are applied to extract candidate regions of traffic signs. The recognition system nearly achieves real-time performance. On-line recognition test is performed on the KAIST campus road, and the result shows all 16 traffic signs are recognized successfully through the driving.

We performed experiments recording a mouth robot and an announcer reading text. We conducted a survey to assess humans guessing the representations of a female announcer and of a robot to compare the percent of correct answers in each case. Additionally, we also conducted a survey of robot mouth shapes and lip-sync timing to assess the reaction of subjects on 5-Likert scales. Results indicate that the percent of correct guesses from the mouth shape of the robot was one third of that from the human announcer. Subjects assessed the mouth shape and lip-sync timing of the robot as being somewhat unnatural. We expect that android robot lip-syncing currently uses mouth shapes that are perceived as lying in the uncanny valley when subjects try to interpret them.

The devices comprise waveguide arrays of Mach-Zehnder interferometers with linearly increasing optical path differences, enabling scan-less spectral retrieval with large radiant throughput. Resolutions down to 40pm are experimentally demonstrated. Spatial heterodyne Fourier-transform (SHFT) spectrometry is an interferometric technique which circumvents the need of moving elements and provides an increased \u03adtendue. The SHFT scheme can be implemented with a waveguide array of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) with linearly increasing optical path differences. The high refractive index contrast of the SOI platform and the waveguide bend radius of ~ 5 \u03bcm readily allow achieving high resolutions in a reduced footprint. We report three alternative implementations of the SHFT principle in SOI waveguides. Firstly, a SHFT chip with Si-wire microphotonic spirals, reaching a resolution of 40 pm at a central wavelength near 1.5 \u03bcm. Secondly, a SHFT micro-spectrometer with subwavelength gratings for refractive index engineering of the optical delay lines. Finally, an extension of the SHFT scheme to the mid-infrared, addressing specific challenges of this spectral region such as efficient coupling and power splitting structures, and robust performance over a substantially broader free spectral range. SHFT spectrometers are promising for a wide range of applications, including chemical and biological sensing, astronomy, communications, hand-held spectroscopy, and sensing from satellites or planetary rowers. Furthermore, the resolution of these devices can be readily scaled up to very long optical delays, opening a new pathway toward possibly overcoming current resolution limits of state-of-the-art spectroscopic instruments.","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734234","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734234.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","startPage":"60","endPage":"61","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fourier-transform on-chip microspectrometers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fourier-transform on-chip microspectrometers","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7734234/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16481423","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7734234/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fourier-transform on-chip microspectrometers","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1A05_0900_Page60_61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109029S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7734234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7734246,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Institute of Semiconductors Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Ming Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7734246","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonics","Biomedical optical imaging","Integrated optics","Optical signal processing","Ultrafast optics","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differentiating circuits","Fourier transforms","Hilbert transforms","integrated optoelectronics","integrating circuits","optical information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical analog signal processing","electronic devices","all-optical signal processing","ultrafast telecommunications","optical computing","microwave photonics","biophotonics","all-optical signal-processing","photonic technologies","electronic circuits","all-optical information processing","computing circuits","all optical temporal differentiators","integrators","Fourier transforms","Hilbert transformers"]}],"abstract":"All-optical implementations of signal processing have attracted a great deal of attention due to the unique potential of this approach to overcome the bandwidth and speed bottleneck of electronic devices. Many all-optical signal processing techniques, offering processing bandwidths up to several THz, have been proposed and successfully employed in a wide range of areas, such as ultrafast telecommunications, optical computing, microwave photonics and biophotonics etc.. To build up an all-optical signal-processing and computing platform with complex functionality, a promising solution is to emulate the developments in the electronic domain using photonic technologies. For this purpose, photonics counterparts of fundamental components that form basic building blocks in electronic circuits need to be designed and realized.

The property of artificial circular dielectric resonator emphasized on the analysis is the resonant frequency of some resonance mode which is affected by its anisotropic permittivity. The FDTD method used for the analysis is developed based on a cylindrical coordinate system, instead of a Cartesian coordinate system, which suit to model the shape of analyzed structure. The anisotropic permittivity of artificial circular dielectric resonator is obtained by providing the different values of relative permittivity in each axis of cylindrical coordinate, i.e., \u03b5\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03c1</sub>\n, \u03b5\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03c6</sub>\n, and \u03b5\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">z</sub>\n. Meanwhile, the analysis is carried out by discretizing a model of waveguide loaded with artificial circular dielectric resonator in which the radius and the length of waveguide are 16.27mm and 100 mm, respectively. To verify the result of FDTD method, the theoretical approach is carried out by calculating its resonant frequency for corresponding resonance mode.

treatment. Widely used modalities for scanning the presence of cancer such as Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging still have problems related to the cost, size and equipment complexity. Microwave imaging is considered as an alternative modality due to its low health risk, low cost, ease of use, and portability. It exploits dielectric characteristics differences of various types of body tissue and uses tomography for image reconstruction. Tomography refers to collecting transmission or reflection data by illuminating an object from different directions to obtain its cross-sectional image. There are two major categories for image reconstruction methods, analytical reconstruction and iterative reconstruction. A widely used analytical reconstruction method, Filtered Back-Projection (FBP), has efficient computation and numerical stability. However, iterative reconstruction method such as Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) efficiently improves the quality of reconstructed images, in particular when the projected data is noisy or in a limited amount. In this project, a microwave imaging system for scanning the presence of cancer in the body is designed. For obtaining the projected data, the system uses a pair of dipole antennas as a transmitter and a receiver at frequency of 3 GHz with translation of the receiver antenna, and rotation of the antenna pair (Tx-Rx) during the scanning process. Two types of numerical phantom are examined for validating the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) algorithm of the image reconstruction system. The first phantom is a 180 \u00d7 180 pixels of Shepp-Logan phantom generated from Matlab, and the second phantom is a two-layer cylindrical phantom. The cylindrical phantom has a diameter of 18 cm for the outer layer with relative permittivity is set by 4.3, representing normal tissue, and a diameter of 7.5 cm for the inner layer with the relative permittivity is set by 10.2, representing benign or malignant tissue. The simulation on quantitative parameters such as mean-squared error and structural similarity index of the reconstructed image show converging trends within 100 iterations. The value of the mean-squared error at 100th iteration is 45.16% for the Shepp-Logan phantom and 36.56% for the cylindrical phantom. The second quantitative parameter evaluated is the structural similarity index, which reaches 0.04 for the Shepp-Logan phantom and 0.008 for the cylindrical phantom.","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734395","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734395.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Algebraic Reconstruction Technique algorithm for microwave imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7734395/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Algebraic Reconstruction Technique algorithm for microwave imaging","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449929","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7734395/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Algebraic Reconstruction Technique algorithm for microwave imaging","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1A_0_78_Page587_591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042553S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7734395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7734419,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A combination of geometric focusing in elevation and MIMO based digital beam forming in azimuth will provide real-time 3D images. The MIMO system consists of 16 transmitter and 16 receiver antennas within one single array. This configuration represents a linear array of 256 virtual antennas. This set-up allows an azimuth resolution of 0.078 degrees. To achieve an elevation resolution of 0.15 degrees, the combination of a fast moving plane reflector and a focusing elliptical mirror is used.

Designing silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)-based applications requires a careful consideration of fabrication-induced process variations. While numerical simulations (e.g., FDTD) help predict a device's behaviour after its fabrication, applying such methods to large-scale PICs is not feasible as they impose an extremely high computation cost. In this work, we present a computationally efficient and yet accurate bottom-up approach to study the impact of fabrication-induced process variations on passive silicon photonic devices and integrated circuits. The bottom-up approach starts by studying the impact of process variations on the effective and group indices of strip waveguides (component level). Leveraging the analytical models at the component level, we evaluate the tolerance of microresonator (MR)-based add-drop filters and switches under different process variations (device level). We specifically consider the variations in the top silicon thickness and waveguide width. Compared with time-consuming numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed method is highly efficient in terms of accuracy and computation time: an error rate smaller than 1% and a speed-up greater than 100\u00d7 are achieved. Our study also involves the design, fabrication, and analysis of several identically-designed fabricated MRs, for which we evaluate the within-die variations and also quantify the resonance wavelength shifts. Moreover, we indicate a strong correlation among the resonance wavelengths of the MRs in proximity as well as those which are not in close proximity. Our proposed method helps evaluate the impact of process variations on the performance of large-scale PICs, determining power penalties required to trim/tune (e.g., thermal tuning) faulty devices in such systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon photonics","Integrated circuits","Fabrication","Computers","Numerical simulation","Electromagnetic waveguides","Electromagnetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","integrated optics","micromechanical resonators","optical waveguides","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tolerance analysis","silicon photonic integrated circuits","fabrication-induced process variations","passive silicon photonic devices","bottom-up approach","strip waveguides","microresonator","add-drop filters","top silicon thickness","waveguide width","Si"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734465","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734465","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734465.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734465","startPage":"783","endPage":"783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling efficient tolerance analysis in silicon photonic integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enabling efficient tolerance analysis in silicon photonic integrated circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7734465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462764","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling efficient tolerance analysis in silicon photonic integrated circuits","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1P05_1420_Page783.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029578S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7734465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7734500,"authors":[{"name":"Gurkirandeep Kaur","affiliation":["Thapar University, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Gurkirandeep","lastName":"Kaur","id":"37085885213"},{"name":"Rana Pratap Yadav","affiliation":["Thapar University, Punjab, India"],"lastName":"Rana Pratap Yadav","id":"37085896465"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7734500","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Plasmas","Finite difference methods","Antenna radiation patterns","Time-domain analysis","Directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","finite difference time-domain analysis","monopole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plasma monopole antenna","2D FDTD method","numerical analysis","finite difference time domain","full wave computational electromagnetics technique","antenna radiation pattern"]}],"abstract":"Numerical analysis of plasma monopole antenna by using full wave computational electromagnetics technique, finite difference time domain (FDTD) is presented.

The success of the this class of algorithms, which are often collectively indicated as Compressive Sensing (CS) [9], is motivated by several concurring factors, including their accuracy, robustness, numerical efficiency, capability to handle several different contexts (e.g., including transverse-magnetic [2] and transverse-electric problems [3], single-/multi-frequency data [2, 4], isotropic/anisotropic media [1]) in a seamless way, and the availability of efficient implementations of many different solvers [1]. On the other hand, CS techniques are not general-purpose imaging algorithms. Their application requires the problem at hand to comply with some fundamental assumptions [1], including the fact that the unknown (e.g., the contrast [8] or equivalent currents [9]) is sparse in the employed basis. Early applications of CS methods, which used simple pixel-bases to expand the unknowns, addressed only those scenarios were the object is composed by few isolated pixels [2]. Nevertheless, it is well known that sparsity is not an absolute concept, but it is always in relation with the representation basis [1]. The use of different expansion bases [10] has been then proposed to enable more complex profiles to be imaged [7]. Unfortunately, such techniques always assume that some knowledge on the target profile is available, so that this a-priori information can be exploited to define the most suitable expansion basis to be adopted [7]. A different perspective is considered in this paper to enable the application of CS methodologies when no prior information on the class of targets under investigation is available. More specifically, a large alphabet of candidate bases is generated off-line, and for each basis a candidate reconstructions are carried out in parallel \u201conline\u201d by the CS retrieval tool. The retrieved profiles are then compared, and a sparsity-based criterion is adopted in turns to select the most reliable reconstruction (among those obtained by the different bases). Preliminary numerical experiments will be shown to assess the accuracy and numerical efficiency of the proposed imaging methodology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imaging complex targets through alphabet-based compressive sensing","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734535","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734535.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7734535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Imaging complex targets through alphabet-based compressive sensing","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462305","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imaging complex targets through alphabet-based compressive sensing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1P10_1645_Page943_944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081806S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7734535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7734581,"authors":[{"name":"Wojciech Bednarczyk","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bednarczyk","id":"37085436151"},{"name":"Piotr Gajewski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Gajewski","id":"37282866200"},{"name":"Leszek Nowosielski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Leszek","lastName":"Nowosielski","id":"37547726500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7734581","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Sensors","Cognitive radio","Markov processes","Electromagnetics","Probability distribution","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy conservation","energy consumption","hidden Markov models","interference suppression","radio spectrum management","telecommunication power management","telecommunication switching","telecommunication traffic","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient dynamic spectrum management","cognitive radio sensor networks","energy consumption problem","channel interference reduction","channel management algorithm","hidden Markov model","HMM","channel sensing","channel switching","data transmission-reception","spectrum occupancy predictor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734581","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734581","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","abstract":"Efficient Dynamic Spectrum Management balances the energy consumption problem, eliminates conflicts between the nodes, reduces the channel interference, divides the traffics over different channels and time slots.

The results obtained using HMM as a spectrum occupancy predictor are very promising and they show that HMM offer a new paradigm for predicting channel behavior in Cognitive Radio.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","startPage":"1075","endPage":"1079","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734581.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient Dynamic Spectrum Management in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7734581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7734581/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient Dynamic Spectrum Management in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449930","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient Dynamic Spectrum Management in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1P14_1740_Page1075_1079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072298S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7734581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7734623,"authors":[{"name":"Laksmi Juwita","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia","PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Laksmi","lastName":"Juwita","id":"37085895799"},{"name":"Purnomo Sidi Priambodo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Purnomo Sidi","lastName":"Priambodo","id":"37689569300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7734623","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser cavity resonators","Semiconductor lasers","Optical resonators","Distributed feedback devices","Fiber lasers","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed feedback lasers","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","laser cavity resonators","optical fibre communication","semiconductor lasers","spectral line narrowing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent laser structure analysis","high speed optical communication","coherent digital optical transmission","long-haul fiber optic transmission systems","laser linewidth narrowing","external cavity resonator","Schawlow-Townes equation","laser current injection","Optiwave software","laser coherent system","fiber laser","distributed feedback laser diode","bandwidth 100 kHz","bit rate 100 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"Over the past seven years, the coherent digital optical transmission enables a new generation of high speed optical communication. Coherent transmission technologies have delivered improvement in the capacity-reach product for long-haul fiber optic transmission systems. The coherent digital optical transmission is able to reach bit rates up to 100 Gbit/s. One of the keys of the ideal coherent optical communication is by narrowing laser linewidth. Several approaches to narrow the laser linewidth have been proposed. For instances by adding the length of external cavity resonator as shown by Schawlow-Townes equation and the other one is by controlling laser current injection. This paper is proposed to analyze the structure of coherent laser system to obtain a coherent laser linewidth as narrow as possible by adding external cavity and controlling the laser current injection. The analysis and simulations are performed using Optiwave software. Based on our proposed laser coherent system, we are able to obtain linewidth of 100 kHz. This linewidth is sufficient enough to support for high speed 100 Gbit/s optical communication system.","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734623","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent laser structure analysis for high speed optical communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coherent laser structure analysis for high speed optical communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7734623/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462128","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7734623/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent laser structure analysis for high speed optical communication","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1P_0_28_Page1220_1224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039594S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7734623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7734629,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Tao","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Jun Tao","id":"37085901089"},{"name":"Quanyuan Feng","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Quanyuan Feng","id":"37285943200"},{"name":"Dengyao Tian","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Dengyao Tian","id":"37085890177"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7734629","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Ultra wideband antennas","Slot antennas","Impedance","Bandwidth","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","coplanar waveguides","microwave antenna arrays","MIMO communication","omnidirectional antennas","UHF antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrawideband MIMO antenna","compact coplanar waveguide-fed antenna","half slot structure","compact multiple-input-multiple-output antenna","symmetrically placed half slot antenna elements","ground plane","coplanar waveguide-fed structure","multiple resonant frequency","compact construction","impedance bandwidth","impedance matching","fine-tuned ellipse-shaped radiator","semimajor axis","semiminor axis","reflection coefficient","dielectric loss","fork-shaped slot","omnidirectional radiation patterns","bandwidth 3 GHz to 12.6 GHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a compact multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna is proposed for Ultra-wideband (UWB) applications. The proposed MIMO antenna is comprised by two symmetrically placed half slot antenna elements which one side of the slot is open to the air. Two antenna elements share the same ground plane, and each opening of the half slot gapes to the opposite directions. For covering the entire UWB frequency band, coplanar waveguide-fed structure is utilized in the antenna. This feeding mechanism is prone to generating multiple resonant frequencies and realizing the compact construction. The impedance bandwidth is sensitive to the shape of the radiator. To realize good impedance matching, a fine-tuned ellipse-shaped radiator, which is with semi-major axis 4.8mm and semi-minor axis 3.74 mm, is obtained through numerous optimizations and experiments. The reflection coefficient decreases at the high frequency, because the currents are concentrated on the edge of the slot, and the dielectric loss leads to the loss of energy. To achieve good isolation performance at lower UWB frequency, a fork-shaped slot is etched on the ground, at the center of the bottom. The fork-shaped slot effectively suppresses the currents flowing on the same ground plane, and the mutual coupling of 3-5 GHz reduces from -8 dB to -15 dB below. The overall size of the proposed antenna is only 23 \u00d7 18mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

These technologies will create the small wireless networks for the distribution of data services such as internet, video, audio, etc. transmission. For these services, it is preferable to use the UWB frequency band from 3 GHz to 11 GHz because of the hardware support availability. An estimation of transmission channel characteristic is time-consuming and computationally demanding process. Presented paper deals with the channel transfer function estimation for different receiving antenna locations determined by the two dimensional grid. Proposed artificial neural network used for the analysis of the transmission channel is based on the feed forward and radial basis function structure. Neural networks have been optimized using measured channel transfer function to achieve better effectiveness, speed and accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734683","startPage":"1465","endPage":"1469","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734683.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation the transmission between antennas using artificial neural networks in the UWB band","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Transmitting antennas","Automobiles","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave antennas","neural nets","receiving antennas","telecommunication computing","UHF antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiving antenna locations","artificial neural networks","UWB band","intra-car communication technology","small wireless networks","data service distribution","hardware support availability","transmission channel characteristic estimation","time-consuming process","computationally demanding process","channel transfer function estimation","two dimensional grid","feed forward structure","radial basis function structure","frequency 3 GHz to 11 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7734683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Estimation the transmission between antennas using artificial neural networks in the UWB band","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7734683/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16463142","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation the transmission between antennas using artificial neural networks in the UWB band","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1P_0_94_Page1465_1469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040416S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7734683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7734693,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Liang Yang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiao Liang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085554599"},{"name":"Gong Jian Wen","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Gong Jian","lastName":"Wen","id":"37840641100"},{"name":"Cong Hui Ma","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Cong Hui","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085354323"},{"name":"Bai Yuan Ding","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Bai Yuan Ding","id":"37085727430"},{"name":"Shao Hua Qiu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Shao Hua Qiu","id":"37085821274"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7734693","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Projectiles","Radar","Scattering","Motion compensation","Electromagnetics","Distortion","Pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","pose estimation","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D electromagnetic model based algorithm","high resolution range profile motion compensation","stepped frequency wideband radar","HRRP","flying projectile","pose estimation","three dimensional electromagnetic-model","geometric structure","motion compensation","high frequency electromagnetic code"]}],"abstract":"By utilizing a stepped-frequency wideband radar, high-resolution range profiles (HRRPs) of a target can be obtained. However, due to the high speed of a flying projectile, there are severe distortions on its HRRPs. These distortions, if ignored, will greatly degrade the performance of the pose estimation. In this paper, a method for HRRP motion compensation based on the three dimensional electromagnetic-model (3-D em-model) is proposed. The 3-D em-model is established offline based on the geometric structure of the target. By matching the HRRPs of measurements and HRRPs generated from the 3-D em-model, both motion compensation and pose estimation can be accomplished simultaneously. Experiments using the data predicted by a high-frequency electromagnetic code verify the validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734693","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734693.pdf","startPage":"1504","endPage":"1508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3-D electromagnetic-model-based algorithm for high-resolution range profile motion compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7734693/","displayDocTitle":"A 3-D electromagnetic-model-based algorithm for high-resolution range profile motion compensation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462780","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7734693/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3-D electromagnetic-model-based algorithm for high-resolution range profile motion compensation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1P_0_a104_Page1504_1508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054413S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7734693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7734696,"authors":[{"name":"Zbigniew Szadkowski","affiliation":["Faculty of High-Energy Astrophysics, University of L\u00f3d\u017a, L\u00f3d\u017a, Poland"],"firstName":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Szadkowski","id":"37268778000"},{"name":"Dariusz G\u0142as","affiliation":["Faculty of High-Energy Astrophysics, University of L\u00f3d\u017a, L\u00f3d\u017a, Poland"],"firstName":"Dariusz","lastName":"G\u0142as","id":"37085419450"},{"name":"Krzysztof Pytel","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of L\u00f3d\u017a, L\u00f3d\u017a, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Pytel","id":"37089108979"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7734696","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734696","abstract":"The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is still a mystery.

However, the additive noise may be present in many practical applications. The bias caused by noise will limit the separation performance of the BSS algorithm. The existing modified algorithms based on quasi-whitening only can improve the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the separated signals, but cannot effectively suppress the additive noise. This paper addresses this difficult problem. We introduce a robust preprocessing approach, which allows one to find the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) separation matrix up to an orthogonal or unitary factor. Combining the fast independent component analysis (FastICA) algorithm, the mixed signals can be robust separated. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the separated signals.","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734822","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734822.pdf","startPage":"1887","endPage":"1893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust preprocessing method for noisy blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7734822/","displayDocTitle":"A robust preprocessing method for noisy blind source separation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462294","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7734822/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust preprocessing method for noisy blind source separation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2A_0_02_Page1887_1893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052588S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7734822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7734868,"authors":[{"name":"Tiancheng Luo","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Tiancheng Luo","id":"37087652188"},{"name":"Huanxin Zou","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Huanxin Zou","id":"37087343018"},{"name":"Hongyan Kang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Hongyan Kang","id":"37087187428"},{"name":"Xianxiang Qin","affiliation":["Information and Navigation College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Xianxiang Qin","id":"37087650413"},{"name":"Shilin Zhou","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Shilin Zhou","id":"37087567111"},{"name":"Kefeng Ji","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Kefeng Ji","id":"37087331889"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7734868","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Support vector machines","Buildings","Vegetation mapping","Feature extraction","Remote sensing","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","radar imaging","radar polarimetry","support vector machines","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervised classification algorithm","PolSAR images","adaptive sample censoring strategy","polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images","SVM","training sample optimization","feature extraction","target decomposition theories","adaptive threshold"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734868","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734868.pdf","startPage":"2049","endPage":"2053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised classification of PolSAR images using adaptive sample censoring strategy","abstract":"In this paper, a supervised classification algorithm of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images based on SVM with training sample optimization is proposed.

Simulation results illustrating the spectrogram of the proposed OFDM waveform and the algorithm's performance in 2-D SAR imaging scenarios are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734869","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07734869.pdf","startPage":"2054","endPage":"2058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A waveform with low intercept probability for OFDM SAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7734869/","displayDocTitle":"A waveform with low intercept probability for OFDM SAR","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462605","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7734869/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A waveform with low intercept probability for OFDM SAR","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2A_0_50_Page2054_2058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077014S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7734869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7734871,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhen Wu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory (ATR), National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Wenzhen Wu","id":"37087653938"},{"name":"Shiyou Xu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory (ATR), National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Shiyou","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085541675"},{"name":"Zengping Chen","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory (ATR), National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zengping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085441070"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7734871","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Scattering","Entropy","Radar","Focusing","Electromagnetics","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","image sampling","matched filters","pulse compression","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deviation analysis","pulse compression","ISAR imaging","direct intermediate frequency sampling data","linear frequency modulation","LFM signal","matched filtering","high resolution range profile","HRRP","discrete sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734871","abstract":"Deviation in ISAR images is inevitable, especially for the phase part.

In existing research works, SAR images are part of the data sources which have been most widely studied because they can be obtained day and night, regardless of the impact from meteorological conditions. This paper mainly aims at the existing problems of intelligent detection algorithm for ship targets in SAR image, such as the uncertainty of the automatic censoring. A novel algorithm for ship detection based on anomaly detection theory was presented. Firstly, we transform the SAR image into hyper-spectral form by rearranging the spatially adjacent pixels into a vector, which combines the gray feature and context feature of pixels and improves the separation degree between background and ship, including the accuracy of separation. Then a hyper-spectral algorithm is applied to extract ship candidates preliminarily and quickly by regarding ships as anomalies. Finally, we choose a CFAR detector to extract ships more accurately. In the background clutter modeling stage, the clutter environment can be determined adaptively to prescreen the clutter pixels in the sliding window used for detecting. In the detection stage, we just need to examine the ship candidate pixels. The effectiveness of the algorithm is tested by the measured SAR images. Experimental results show that the algorithm has a better detection performance and high fidelity of target structure. Meanwhile, this algorithm can also reduce the number of false alarm and side-lobe.","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735144","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07735144.pdf","startPage":"2868","endPage":"2872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel ship detection algorithm based on anomaly detection theory for SAR images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7735144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7735144/","displayDocTitle":"A novel ship detection algorithm based on anomaly detection theory for SAR images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462209","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7735144/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel ship detection algorithm based on anomaly detection theory for SAR images","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2P_0_47_Page2868_2872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043937S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7735144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7735147,"authors":[{"name":"Shengqiang Lou","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Shengqiang Lou","id":"37087443635"},{"name":"Pu Cheng","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Pu Cheng","id":"37087444853"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7735147","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7735147","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","Covariance matrices","Azimuth","Synthetic aperture radar","Image reconstruction","Electromagnetics","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix inversion","radar signal processing","signal reconstruction","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["periodic nonuniformly sampled azimuth signal reconstruction","matrix inversion method","multichannel SAR","azimuth resolution","synthetic aperture radar system","reconstruction filter","system matrix","Vandermonde matrix","diagonal matrix","signal noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"To overcome the contradiction between wide swath and high azimuth resolution in synthetic aperture radar system, matrix inversion method is investigated to unambiguously recover the nonuniformly sampled azimuth signal.

In this paper, sub-Nyquist sampling jamming against wideband linear frequency modulated (LFM) radar is addressed, where the CS-based algorithm is applied to achieve the range compression via matched filtering (MF). The results show that the sub-Nyquist sampled jamming signals, formed by the under-sampled radar signals in scatter-wave jamming configuration, provide a capability of deception jamming. Hence, sub-Nyquist sampling jamming can generate active decoys in radar countermeasures. Simulated trials are used to verify the correctness of the jamming idea.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7735176/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7735176/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462249","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sub-Nyquist sampling jamming against wideband LFM radar with CS-based matched filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-Nyquist sampling jamming against wideband LFM radar with CS-based matched filtering","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2P_0_79_Page2995_3001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063279S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7735176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7735271,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Ding","affiliation":["School of Power and Mechanical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Ding","id":"37647584600"},{"name":"Gaofeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Gaofeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085774299"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7735271","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7735271","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Ultra wideband antennas","Particle swarm optimization","Bandwidth","Quantum mechanics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic fields","particle swarm optimisation","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design parameter optimization","ultrawideband antenna","quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","QPSO","cell phones","wireless Internet","Internet of Things","hand-held equipments","wearable mobile communication equipments","multiobjective optimization","particle swarm diversity","diversity-controlling strategy","global optimization","CPW-fed elliptic UWB antenna","electromagnetic field solver","dynamic inertial coefficient"]}],"abstract":"The Ultra-Wideband (UWB) antenna, as core device in high-speed wireless communication, is widely applied to cell phones, wireless internet, internet of things, and almost all kinds of hand-held and wearable mobile communication equipments. Faced with a plethora of constraints, such as compact size, low power consumption, high bandwidth, and cost-effective manufacture, etc., the design of UWB antenna is essentially a complicated problem of multiobjective optimization. As a variant of the family of particle swarm optimization (PSO), the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) adopts the potential well of quantum mechanics to mimic the movement of particles and the length of potential well as the measurement of the particle swarm diversity, and the diversity-controlling strategy is adopted to help particle swarm jump out of the local space where the fitness stagnates so as to improve global optimization. The aforementioned properties make QPSO a potential method in the design parameter optimization of UWB antenna. Nevertheless, up to now, there are very few such reports and QPSO haven't gotten enough attention in antenna design. In this report, design parameters of a CPW-fed elliptic UWB antenna are optimized using QPSO combined with the electromagnetic field solver and different diversity-controlling strategies are devised and employed to improve global optimization. The simulation results demonstrate the ratio bandwidth is broadened by 54% while the overall size remains the same. Besides, the PSO with dynamic inertial coefficient is also applied to the same antenna design. Comparison shows the QPSO with diversity-controlling strategy achieves better design results for this UWB antenna meanwhile converges much faster.","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07735271.pdf","startPage":"3235","endPage":"3241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735271","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design parameter optimization of Ultra-Wideband antenna using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design parameter optimization of Ultra-Wideband antenna using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7735271/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7735271/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16463364","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design parameter optimization of Ultra-Wideband antenna using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3A08_1120_Page3235_3241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062832S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7735271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7735378,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaozhen Ren","affiliation":["Henan University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiaozhen","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085456226"},{"name":"Yao Qin","affiliation":["Henan University of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Yao Qin","id":"37085471734"},{"name":"Lihong Qiao","affiliation":["Henan University of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Lihong Qiao","id":"37699850300"},{"name":"Pengpeng Li","affiliation":["Henan University of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Pengpeng Li","id":"37085885808"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7735378","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"abstract":"Multibaseline SAR tomography is an advanced 3D SAR imaging mode, which is widely utilized in many military and civilian fields. As the height data received by tomography SAR is sparse and non uniform, conventional method can not obtain satisfactory imaging results. The compressed sensing (CS) based methods for tomography SAR imaging perform well in the case of large number of baselines. However, the performance of CS based methods degrades rapidly with the decrease of the number of baselines. In this paper, a new strategy for tomography SAR imaging based on distributed compressed sensing is proposed. As using neighboring pixels information in reconstruction, the proposed method can improve the performne of CS based methods in the case of strong noise and a little number of baselines. Experiment results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07735378.pdf","startPage":"3588","endPage":"3591","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7735378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tomography SAR imaging based on distributed compressed sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Synthetic aperture radar","Radar polarimetry","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Electromagnetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tomography SAR imaging","distributed compressed sensing","multibaseline SAR tomography","advanced 3D SAR imaging mode","civilian fields","military fields","CS","neighboring pixels information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7735378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Tomography SAR imaging based on distributed compressed sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7735378/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462600","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tomography SAR imaging based on distributed compressed sensing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3A_0_50_Page3588_3591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091478S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7735378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7735432,"authors":[{"name":"Akriti Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Akriti","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085376591"},{"name":"Neel Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Neel","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37085741501"},{"name":"Malay Ranjan Tripathy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Malay Ranjan","lastName":"Tripathy","id":"38242184600"},{"name":"Sujata Pandey","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Sujata","lastName":"Pandey","id":"37085358776"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7735432","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":406},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Logic gates","HEMTs","Linearity","Radio frequency","Wide band gap semiconductors","Aluminum gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","millimetre wave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF amplifiers","reduced channel HEMT","current densities","device characteristics","process parameters","linearity performance","radiofrequency application","IIP3","linearity parameters","frequency 150 GHz","voltage -1 V","AlGaN-GaN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7735432","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07735432.pdf","startPage":"3815","endPage":"3819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and simulation of GaN HEMT and its application to RF amplifiers","abstract":"In this paper we propose a reduced channel AlGaN/GaN HEMT with high current densities and high frequency.

The threedimensional (3D) beamforming technique has obtained a growing attention due to its potential that enables several strategies like user specific elevation beamforming and vertical sectorization compared to conventional horizontal beamforming. In this paper, a new 3D multi-band beamforming technique is proposed. The proposed technique is based on a combination ofahorizontal and elevation beamforming using least mean square (LMS) algorithm for a fractal planar array. Simulation results evaluate the performance of the proposed beamforming technique showing that the proposed technique outperforms the direction of arrival (DOA), Eigen-structure and conventional beamforming techniques in addition to the multi-band property of the fractal planar array. The performance is investigated by measuring the percentage commutative density function (%CDF) of post receiver signals to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7735725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16481408","htmlLink":"/document/7735725/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"3D Multi-band fractal beamforming based on LMS algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Multi-band fractal beamforming based on LMS algorithm","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4A08_1020_Page4690_4694.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045445S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7735725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7735726,"authors":[{"name":"Jinbae Suh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinbae","lastName":"Suh","id":"37085902288"},{"name":"Joohwan Chun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joohwan","lastName":"Chun","id":"37085530077"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7735726","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7735726","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Computational complexity","Antenna arrays","Array signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","covariance matrices","Hessian matrices","Newton method","optimisation","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming algorithms","worst-case SINR maximization","interference","adaptive beamforming","direction of angle","DOA","receiver antenna array","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","signal angle","Eigen decomposition algorithm","covariance matrix","Newton algorithm","gradient vector","Hessian matrix","Newton method","complexity computation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735726","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07735726.pdf","startPage":"4695","endPage":"4699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of beamforming algorithms via worst-case SINR maximization","abstract":"In communication systems with interference, the performance of traditional adaptive beamforming to search the direction of angle (DOA) of incoming desired signal degrades because of mismatch between the true array response and the assumed array response of desired signal in a receiver antenna array. In this paper, we approach the method of maximum output Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) to find array response of the incoming desired signal angle. General method to find the array response with output maximum SINR is an eigen decomposition algorithm. The Eigen decomposition algorithm is derived from eigen decomposition of covariance matrix of incoming signal in a receiver antenna array and find the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue. Also, the Newton's algorithm uses the gradient vector and Hessian matrix of SINR equation, which formulates of the covariance matrix with incoming signal in a receiver antenna array, and updates the array response. To reduce the complexity computation of Newton's method, the LMS algorithm does not require the Hessian matrix of SINR equation, and updates the array response by using only the gradient vector of SINR equation. We compare the complexity computation and simulate the performances of each algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7735726/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16463537","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7735726/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of beamforming algorithms via worst-case SINR maximization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of beamforming algorithms via worst-case SINR maximization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4A08_1040_Page4695_4699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050639S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7735726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7735734,"authors":[{"name":"H.

One the other hand, most of the computations corresponding to the cells in the same iteration (apart from the cells on the boundaries) are completely independent of each other.

In our approach, we use the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) models on the basis that in our observations, the noise time series residuals indicates heteroskedasticity. By performing an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of the noise data, the empirical results show that the conditional variance process is highly persistent in the residuals. The variance of the error terms are not uniform, in fact, the error terms are larger at some portions of the data than at other time instances. Thus, PLC impulsive noise often exhibit volatility clustering where the noise time series is comprised of periods of high volatility followed by periods of high volatility and periods of low volatility followed by periods of low volatility. The burstiness of PLC impulsive noise is therefore not spread randomly across the time period, but instead has a degree of autocorrelation. This provides evidence of time-varying conditional second order moment of the noise time series. Based on these properties, the noise time series data is said to suffer from heteroskedasticity. Numerical results provide evidence that the proposed model is capable of providing an accurate stochastic representation of the impulsive noise in the 1-30MHz frequency band. The parameter estimates of the model indicates a high degree of persistence in conditional volatility of impulsive noise which is a strong evidence of explosive volatility.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07735782.pdf","startPage":"4876","endPage":"4880","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7735782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of asynchronous impulsive noise volatility for indoor powerline communication systems using GARCH models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Autoregressive processes","Noise measurement","Data models","Frequency synchronization","Home appliances"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","correlation methods","impulse noise","indoor communication","least squares approximations","regression analysis","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic representation","time-varying conditional second order moment","autocorrelation degree","volatility clustering","error terms","conditional variance process","ordinary least squares regression","noise time series residuals","GARCH models","generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic models","asynchronous impulsive noise volatility","indoor powerline communication systems","frequency 1 MHz to 30 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7735782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of asynchronous impulsive noise volatility for indoor powerline communication systems using GARCH models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7735782/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462957","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of asynchronous impulsive noise volatility for indoor powerline communication systems using GARCH models","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4P02_1735_Page4876_4880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058011S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7735782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7735811,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Ye","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Ye","id":"37593305900"},{"name":"Han Yu","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085822985"},{"name":"Ling Wang","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088815500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7735811","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Matching pursuit algorithms","Reconstruction algorithms","Wireless communication","Estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","Long Term Evolution","radio receivers","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation algorithm","compressed sensing","wireless communication system","transmitter","receiver","wireless channel","extremely complex","received signal","transmitted signal","LTE-Advanced system","channel state information","sparse characteristics","compressed sensing theory","the LTE-A uplink channel","communication radio channel","orthogonal matching pursuit reconstruction algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The performance of wireless communication system is not only determined by the transmitter and the receiver, but also by the wireless channel. In practical communication systems, wireless channel is extremely complex and uncertain, which will lead to the distortion of the received signal. In order to recover the transmitted signal more accurately, the receiver needs the channel estimation operation. At the same time, the channel estimation is a basic and crucial technology in the LTE-Advanced system, because the channel state information is needed in many key technologies, such as equilibrium detection, beam-forming, interference alignment etc.. Many researches indicated that the wireless channel has sparse characteristics, but existing channel estimation algorithms do not take advantage of this characteristic. The compressed sensing theory can be used to recover the original data with fewer observation data. In this paper, the compressed sensing theory is used to match the signal model by analyzing the model of received signals. Besides, it is used to estimate the wireless channel for the LTE-A uplink channel by taking advantage of sparse characteristics. Considering that the channel sparsity and the channel length of the practical communication radio channel, this paper proposes an improved channel estimation algorithm based on the orthogonal matching pursuit reconstruction algorithm which can full use of the sparse characteristics of the channel. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can improve the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving the spectrum utilization, because no separate pilot is used for channel estimation. Whats more, the proposed algorithm can reconstruct the channel information effectively.","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735811","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07735811.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","startPage":"4971","endPage":"4975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved channel estimation algorithm based on compressed sensing for LTE-A","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7735811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An improved channel estimation algorithm based on compressed sensing for LTE-A","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7735811/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16463479","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7735811/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved channel estimation algorithm based on compressed sensing for LTE-A","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4P06_1440_Page4971_4975.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097388S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7735811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7735816,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Nie","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Nie","id":"37085885642"},{"name":"Yibing Li","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yibing","lastName":"Li","id":"37598943400"},{"name":"Dandan Liu","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Control Engineering, Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Dandan Liu","id":"37085887805"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7735816","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Blind source separation","Feature extraction","Signal resolution","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","Fourier transforms","matrix algebra","polynomials","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation algorithm","nonstationary source signal separation","local polynomial Fourier transform","frequency-domain feature","time-domain feature","time-varying feature","linear time-frequency analysis","time-frequency resolution","bilinear time-frequency","cross-term interference problem","time-frequency distribution matrices","off-diagonal structure","diagonal structure","joint diagonalization"]}],"abstract":"The separation of non-stationary signals is a hot topic. The blind source separation algorithms based on time-frequency analysis can not only describe the time-domain feature and the frequency-domain feature of signals but also extract the time-varying feature of non-stationary signals. Blind source separation owns better performance in solving the problem of non-stationary signals separation. In traditional methods based on linear time-frequency analysis, the time-frequency resolution is not high. Meanwhile, in traditional methods based on bilinear time-frequency, there is the problem of the cross-term interference. According to these problems, this paper proposes a blind source separation algorithm to separate the source signals based on local polynomial Fourier transform that adjusts the time-frequency resolution and the cross-term interference. First, the observed signals that are received by the senors are processed through whitening. Then, the whitened signals are transformed to get time-frequency distribution matrices through local polynomial Fourier transform. What's more, a strategy of choosing time-frequency distribution matrices is proposed to detect the matrices that own the underlying diagonal or off-diagonal structure and remove other matrices. The thresholds of traditional strategies in other papers are not needed in this paper. Therefore, the strategy of this paper can avoid the blindness of choosing the threshold. Finally, a joint diagonalization of a combined set of time-frequency distribution matrices is done to estimate the mixing matrix and the source signals. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm of this paper can extract the non-stationary source signals effectively and own better performance than other comparison algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735816","publicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7655139/7734201/07735816.pdf","startPage":"4996","endPage":"5000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7734201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A blind source separation algorithm of non-stationary signals based on local polynomial Fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7735816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7735816/","displayDocTitle":"A blind source separation algorithm of non-stationary signals based on local polynomial Fourier transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16462149","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7735816/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A blind source separation algorithm of non-stationary signals based on local polynomial Fourier transform","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4P06_1640_Page4996_5000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050886S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7655139","isNumber":"7734201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7655139","xplore-issue":"7734201","articleId":"7735816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7735817,"authors":[{"name":"Yingsong Li","affiliation":["College of Information and Communications Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yingsong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085899017"},{"name":"Yanyan Wang","affiliation":["College of Information and Communications Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085737629"},{"name":"Zhan Jin","affiliation":["College of Information and Communications Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhan Jin","id":"37085907376"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6093-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6094-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7735817","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7735817","abstract":"An improved zero-attracting normalized least mean square (IZA-NLMS) algorithm is proposed for sparse channel estimation.

The simultaneous transmission and reception of data in non-orthogonal channels makes FD radio a potential solution for the currently limited spectrum. However, its implementation generates high levels of interference either in the form of loopback interference (LI) from the output to the input antenna of a transceiver or in the form of co-channel interference in large-scale multicell networks due to the large number of active links. Using a stochastic geometry model, we investigate how directional antennas can control and mitigate the co-channel interference. Furthermore, we provide a model which characterizes the way directional antennas manage the LI in order to passively suppress it. Our results show that both architectures can benefit significantly by the employment of directional antennas. Finally, we consider the case where both architectures are employed in the network and derive the optimal values for the density fraction of each architecture, which maximize the success probability and the network throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"16","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16618426","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7736037/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Directionality on Interference Mitigation in Full-Duplex Cellular Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Promotion Foundation, Cyprus, under the project FUPLEX","grantNumber":"CY-IL/0114/02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Directionality on Interference Mitigation in Full-Duplex Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-psomas-2625318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128957S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7736037","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7736040,"authors":[{"name":"Ramanathan Subramanian","affiliation":["International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165369/8365921/7736040/subra-2625250-small.gif","p":["Ramanathan Subramanian received the PhD degree in electrical and\n computer engineering from National University of Singapore, in 2008.

ASCERTAIN contains big-five personality scales and emotional self-ratings of 58 users along with their Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and facial activity data, recorded using off-the-shelf sensors while viewing affective movie clips. We first examine relationships between users' affective ratings and personality scales in the context of prior observations, and then study linear and non-linear physiological correlates of emotion and personality. Our analysis suggests that the emotion-personality relationship is better captured by non-linear rather than linear statistics. We finally attempt binary emotion and personality trait recognition using physiological features. Experimental results cumulatively confirm that personality differences are better revealed while comparing user responses to emotionally homogeneous videos, and above-chance recognition is achieved for both affective and personality dimensions.","doi":"10.1109/TAFFC.2016.2625250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165369/8365921/07736040.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8365921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2016.2625250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASCERTAIN: Emotion and Personality Recognition Using Commercial Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"ASCERTAIN: Emotion and Personality Recognition Using Commercial Sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736040/","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17801006","htmlLink":"/document/7736040/","volume":"9","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Human-Centered Cyber-physical Systems"},{"fundingName":"MIUR Cluster Active Ageing at Home"},{"fundingName":"Sensaura Inc."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASCERTAIN: Emotion and Personality Recognition Using Commercial Sensors","sourcePdf":"taffc-subramanian-2625250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163348S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"8365921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"8365921","articleId":"7736040","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7736044,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Ivanov","affiliation":["Qamcom Research and Technology AB, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7736044/ivano-2625253-small.gif","p":["Mikhail Ivanov was born in St. Petersburg, Russia.

In B-CSA, each user acts as both transmitter and receiver in a half-duplex mode. The half-duplex mode gives rise to a double unequal error protection (DUEP) phenomenon: the more a user repeats its packet, the higher the probability that this packet is decoded by other users, but the lower the probability for this user to decode packets from others. We analyze the performance of B-CSA over the packet erasure channel for a finite frame length. In particular, we provide a general analysis of stopping sets for B-CSA and derive an analytical approximation of the performance in the error floor (EF) region, which captures the DUEP feature of B-CSA. Simulation results reveal that the proposed approximation predicts very well the performance of B-CSA in the EF region. Finally, we consider the application of B-CSA to vehicular communications and compare its performance with that of carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), the current MAC protocol in vehicular networks. The results show that B-CSA is able to support a much larger number of users than CSMA with the same reliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736044/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","volume":"65","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16669155","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7736044/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Broadcast Coded Slotted ALOHA: A Finite Frame Length Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det","grantNumber":"2011-5950 and 2011-5961"},{"fundingName":"Ericsson\u2019s Research Foundation, by Chalmers Antenna Systems Excellence Center in the project \u2018Antenna Systems for V2X Communication\u2019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"258418 (COOPNET)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC Consolidator) within the Horizon 2020 Program","grantNumber":"648382 WILLOW"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcast Coded Slotted ALOHA: A Finite Frame Length Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ivanov-2625253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208347S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7736044","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7736050,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew J.

A new knowledge-aided (KA) model that takes into account the nonhomogenous characteristics of the disturbance (clutter and noise) in distributed MIMO radar is proposed. Specifically, the disturbance covariance matrices corresponding to different transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) pairs are modeled as random matrices. These covariance matrices share a prior covariance matrix structure but with different power levels to model the nonhomogeneous clutter powers across different Tx-Rx pairs. Two cases are considered, involving either no range training (i.e., when the disturbance is highly nonhomogeneous) or some range training data. For the first case, we develop a KA generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for range-spread target detection, along with a simplified version of the KA-GLRT for point-like target detection. For the second case, the KA-GLRT becomes computationally intractable, a simple ad-doc KA detector is introduced to take advantage of training data for range-spread target detection. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed detectors in nonhomogeneous environments.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2625266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7753033/07736061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2625266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753033","startPage":"617","endPage":"627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-Aided Range-Spread Target Detection for Distributed MIMO Radar in Nonhomogeneous Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-Aided Range-Spread Target Detection for Distributed MIMO Radar in Nonhomogeneous Environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16486381","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7736061/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-Aided Range-Spread Target Detection for Distributed MIMO Radar in Nonhomogeneous Environments","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2625266-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088939S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7753033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7753033","articleId":"7736061","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7736068,"authors":[{"name":"Xunchao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7893086/7736068/chen-2625245-small.gif","p":["Xunchao Chen received the MS degree in electrical engineering from\n the University of Texas at Dallas.

However, in orderto mitigate the write disturbance in an MLC strategy, data stored in the soft bit must be restored back immediately after the hard bit switching is completed. Furthermore, as the result of MTJ feature size scaling, the soft bit can be expected to become disturbed by the read sensing current, thus requiring an immediate restore operation to ensure the data reliability. In this paper, we design and analyze a novel Adaptive Restore Scheme for Write Disturbance (ARS-WD) and Read Disturbance (ARS-RD), respectively. ARS-WD alleviates restoration overhead by intentionally overwriting soft bit lines which are less likely to be read. ARS-RD, on the other hand, aggregates the potential writes and restore the soft bit line at the time of its eviction from higher level cache. Both of these two schemes are based on a lightweight forecasting approach for the future read behavior of the cache block. Our experimental results show substantial reduction in soft bit line restore operations, delivering 17.9 percent decrease in overall energy consumption and 9.4 percent increase in IPC, while incurring negligible capacity overhead. Moreover, ARS promotes advantages of MLC to provide a preferable L2 design alternative in terms of energy, area and latency product compared to SLC STT-RAM alternatives.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/12/7893086/7736068-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","volume":"66","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7736068/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16824254","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Adaptive Restore Schemes for MLC STT-RAM Cache","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1527249 and CCF-1337244"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"0953946"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Energy-Aware Adaptive Restore Schemes for MLC STT-RAM Cache","sourcePdf":"tc-chen-2625245-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.205964S","chronDate":"May 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7893086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7893086","articleId":"7736068","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7736071,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7736071/liu-2625255-small.gif","p":["Yuan Liu (S\u201911\u2013M\u201913) received the B.S. degree from the Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China, the M.S. degree from the Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006, 2009, and 2013, respectively, all in electronic engineering.

In this paper, we propose a pricing framework for interference management from the D2D users to the cellular system, where the base station (BS) protects itself (or its serving cellular users) by pricing the cross-tier interference caused from the D2D users. A Stackelberg game is formulated to model the interactions between the BS and D2D users. Specifically, the BS sets prices to maximize its revenue (or any desired utility) subject to an interference temperature constraint. For given prices, the D2D users competitively adapt their power allocation strategies for individual utility maximization. We first analyze the competition among the D2D users by noncooperative game theory and an iterative-based distributed power allocation algorithm is proposed. Then, depending on how much network information the BS knows, we develop two optimal algorithms, one for uniform pricing with limited network information and the other for differentiated pricing with global network information. The uniform pricing algorithm can be implemented by a fully distributed manner and requires minimum information exchange between the BS and D2D users, and the differentiated pricing algorithm is partially distributed and requires no iteration between the BS and D2D users. Then, a suboptimal differentiated pricing scheme is proposed to reduce complexity and it can be implemented in a fully distributed fashion. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the proposed framework and algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference-Constrained Pricing for D2D Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2625255","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07736071.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2625255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736071","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7809190/7736071-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Interference-Constrained Pricing for D2D Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7736071/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618453","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401159"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S.","grantNumber":"NSF CPS-1646607, ECCS-1547201, CCF-1456921, CNS-1443917, ECCS-1405121 and NSFC 61428101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Interference-Constrained Pricing for D2D Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2625255-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140036S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7736071","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7736075,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Zhu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7818052/7736075/zhu-2625252-small.gif","p":["Feng Zhu received the B.E. degree in information security from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2011.

Considering the misplaced and newly added tags, fast identifying such unknown tags is of paramount importance, especially in large-scale RFID systems. Existing solutions can either identify all unknown tags with low time-efficiency, or identify most unknown tags quickly by sacrificing the identification accuracy. Unlike existing work, this paper proposes a protocol that utilizes physical layer (PHY) information to identify the intact unknown tag set with high efficiency. We exploit the physical signals in collision slots to separate unknown tags from known tags, a new technique to speed up the ID collection. Such new technique was verified in an RFID prototype system using the USRP-based reader and WISP tags. We also evaluated our protocol to show the efficiency of leveraging PHY signals to successfully get all unknown tag IDs without wasted known tag ID transmission. Simulation results show that our protocols outperform prior unknown tag identification protocols. For example, given 1000 unknown tags and 10 000 known tags, our best protocol has 56.8% less time to the state-of-the-art protocol when collecting all unknown tag IDs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"65","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16598318","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7736075/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Physical-Layer Unknown Tag Identification in Large-scale RFID Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272418 and 61373181"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Support Program of China","grantNumber":"2012BAK26B02"},{"fundingName":"Future Network Prospective Research Program of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BY2013095-5- 02"},{"fundingName":"Lianyungang City Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"CG1420 and JC1508"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008048","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, HK PolyU 4-BCB9 and the program B for Outstanding PhD candidate of Nanjing University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Physical-Layer Unknown Tag Identification in Large-scale RFID Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhu-2625252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117217S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7736075","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7736089,"authors":[{"name":"Xinbin Li","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Xinbin","lastName":"Li","id":"37065203900"},{"name":"Jiajia Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Jiajia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086118463"},{"name":"Lei Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yan","orcid":"0000-0003-0965-4636","id":"37085704356"},{"name":"Song Han","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Han","id":"37085776603"},{"name":"Xinping Guan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinping","lastName":"Guan","id":"37085438188"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7736089","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":776},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Underwater acoustics","Throughput","Data models","Cooperative systems","Prediction algorithms","Context modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay selection technique","underwater acoustic cooperative networks","contextual bandit problem","cooperative relay transmission","relay nodes","cooperative system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contextual bandit","underwater cooperative communication","relay selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736089","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07736089.pdf","startPage":"382","endPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2625300","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2625300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Selection in Underwater Acoustic Cooperative Networks: A Contextual Bandit Approach","abstract":"Cooperative relay transmission is an attractive architecture for underwater acoustic networks.

While the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard greatly enhances the feasibility of 8K with a doubled compression ratio, its implementation is a challenge, owing to ultrahigh-throughput requirements and increased complexity per pixel. The latter comes from the new features of HEVC. At the system level, the most challenging of them is the enlarged and highly variable-size coding/prediction/transform units, which significantly increase the requirement for on-chip memory as pipeline buffers and the difficulty in maintaining pipeline utilization. This paper presents an HEVC decoder chip featuring a system pipeline that works at a nonunified and variable granularity. The pipeline saves on-chip memory with a novel block-in-block-out queue system and a parameter delivery network, while allowing overhead-free and fully pipelined operation of the processing components. With the system pipeline design combined with various component-level optimizations, the proposed decoder in 40 nm achieves a maximum throughput of 4 Gpixels/s or 8K 120 frames/s for the low-delay-P configuration of HEVC, 7.5-55 times faster than prior works. It supports 8K 60 frames/s for the low-delay and random-access configurations. In a normalized comparison, it also shows 3.1-3.6 times better area efficiency and 31%-55% superior energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2016.2616362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7811159/07736091.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2016.2616362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7811159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 8K H.265/HEVC Video Decoder Chip With a New System Pipeline Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736091/","displayDocTitle":"An 8K H.265/HEVC Video Decoder Chip With a New System Pipeline Design","volume":"52","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16584865","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7736091/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001700","fundingName":"Regional Innovation Strategy Support Program of Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan"},{"fundingName":"NEC Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 8K H.265/HEVC Video Decoder Chip With a New System Pipeline Design","sourcePdf":"jssc-zhou-2616362-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109433S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7811159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7811159","articleId":"7736091","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7736093,"authors":[{"name":"Zhehuai Chen","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7756694/7736093/chen-2625459-small.gif","p":["Zhehuai Chen (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree from the\n Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in\n 2014.

One popular decoding implementation is to use a CTC model to predict the phone posteriors at each frame and then perform Viterbi beam search on a modified WFST network. This is still within the traditional frame synchronous decoding framework. In this paper, the peaky posterior property of CTC is carefully investigated and it is found that ignoring blank frames will not introduce additional search errors. Based on this phenomenon, a novel phone synchronous decoding framework is proposed by removing tremendous search redundancy due to blank frames, which results in significant search speed up. The framework naturally leads to an extremely compact phone-level acoustic space representation: CTC lattice. With CTC lattice, efficient and effective modular speech recognition approaches, second pass rescoring for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR), and phone-based keyword spotting (KWS), are also proposed in this paper. Experiments showed that phone synchronous decoding can achieve 3-4 times search speed up without performance degradation compared to frame synchronous decoding. Modular LVCSR with CTC lattice can achieve further WER improvement. KWS with CTC lattice not only achieved significant equal error rate improvement, but also greatly reduced the KWS model size and increased the search speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16499463","htmlLink":"/document/7736093/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Phone Synchronous Speech Recognition With CTC Lattices","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Shanghai Sailing Program","grantNumber":"16YF1405300"},{"fundingName":"Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"China NSFC projects","grantNumber":"61573241 and 61603252"},{"fundingName":"Interdisciplinary Program (14JCZ03) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phone Synchronous Speech Recognition With CTC Lattices","sourcePdf":"taslp-yu-2625459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105966S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7756694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7756694","articleId":"7736093","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7736094,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7736094/li-2625246-small.gif","p":["Bin Li received the bachelor\u2019s degree in automation and the master\u2019s degree in control science and engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics and statistics from Curtin University, Australia, in 2011.

To hedge the mismatch between the true and the estimated channel state information (CSI), several robust receivers have been developed in the past decades. Among these receivers, the Gaussian robust receiver has been shown to be superior in performance. This receiver is designed based on the assumption that the CSI mismatch has Gaussian distribution. However, in real-world applications, the assumption of Guassianity might not hold. Motivated by this fact, a more general distributionally robust receiver is proposed in this paper, where only the mean and the variance of the CSI mismatch distribution are required in the receiver design. A tractable semi-definite programming (SDP) reformulation of the robust receiver design is developed. To suppress the self-interferences, a more advanced distributionally robust receiver is proposed. A tight convex approximation is given and the corresponding tractable SDP reformulation is developed. Moreover, for the sake of easy implementation, we present a simplified distributionally robust receiver. Simulations results are provided to show the effectiveness of our design by comparing with some existing well-known receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributionally Robust Linear Receiver Design for Multi-Access Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2625246","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07736094.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2625246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Distributionally Robust Linear Receiver Design for Multi-Access Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7736094/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618433","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council"},{"fundingName":"Faculty of Science and Engineering of Curtin University","grantNumber":"DP160102819"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributionally Robust Linear Receiver Design for Multi-Access Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-li-2625246-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096766S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7736094","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7736097,"authors":[{"name":"Lennart Blanken","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, AZ, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7900484/7736097/blank-2625309-small.gif","p":["Lennart Blanken received the M.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering (\ncum laude) from the Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, in 2015, where he\n is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Control Systems Technology group, Department of Mechanical\n Engineering.","His research interests include centered on advanced feedforward control, learning control, repetitive control, and\n applications in industrial printing systems."]},"firstName":"Lennart","lastName":"Blanken","id":"37085689715"},{"name":"Frank Boeren","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, AZ, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7900484/7736097/boere-2625309-small.gif","p":["Frank Boeren received the M.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering (\ncum laude) from the Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, in 2012, where he\n is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Control Systems Technology group, Department of Mechanical\n Engineering.","His research interests include system identification for feedforward and feedback control, learning control, and\n applications in semiconductor equipment.","Mr. Boeren received the KIVI NIRIA (Royal Dutch Institution of Engineers) graduation award for the best M.Sc. thesis\n in mechanical engineering in 2012."]},"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Boeren","id":"37073001000"},{"name":"Dennis Bruijnen","affiliation":["Mechatronics Technologies Group, Philips Innovation Services, Eindhoven, AE, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7900484/7736097/bruij-2625309-small.gif","p":["Dennis Bruijnen was born in The Netherlands on March 9, 1980.

Experimental results on an industrial motion system confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate benefits of rational feedforward tuning in motion systems, including preactuation and postactuation.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2016.2625309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2016.2625309","startPage":"826","endPage":"837","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7900484/07736097.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Batch-to-Batch Rational Feedforward Control: From Iterative Learning to Identification Approaches, With Application to a Wafer Stage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Batch-to-Batch Rational Feedforward Control: From Iterative Learning to Identification Approaches, With Application to a Wafer Stage","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7736097/","accessionNumber":"16808483","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736097/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Philips Innovation Services"},{"fundingName":"Innovational Research Incentives Scheme"},{"fundingName":"Precision Motion: Beyond the Nanometer","grantNumber":"13073"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003246","fundingName":"NWO (The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003958","fundingName":"STW (Dutch Science Foundation)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Batch-to-Batch Rational Feedforward Control: From Iterative Learning to Identification Approaches, With Application to a Wafer Stage","sourcePdf":"tmech-blanken-2625309-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142186S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7900484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7900484","articleId":"7736097","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7736105,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7818052/7736105/zhang-2625257-small.gif","p":["Tao Zhang (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in communications and information systems.

For the security enhancement, we propose the two antenna reception schemes: 1) random selection combining (RSC) where Bob selects LB antennas at random to combine the received signals and 2) generalized selection combining (GSC) where Bob selects LB strongest antennas to combine the received signals. We derive the exact closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability of full-duplex multi-antenna spectrum-sharing wiretap networks with ZFB algorithm. In order to explore a new design of the proposed schemes, we provide tractable asymptotic approximations for the secrecy outage probability in high signal-to-noise ratio regime under two distinct scenarios. From the analysis, we demonstrate that: 1) when the main channel is much better than the eavesdropper's channel, GSC/ZFB scheme achieves full diversity NB, while RSC/ZFB scheme only achieves partial diversity LB and 2) GSC/ZFB scheme achieves better secrecy performance than RSC/ZFB with different antenna numbers at Bob.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2625257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2625257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07736105.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Full-Duplex Spectrum-Sharing Wiretap Networks With Different Antenna Reception Schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Secure Full-Duplex Spectrum-Sharing Wiretap Networks With Different Antenna Reception Schemes","volume":"65","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7736105/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16598308","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736105/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundations of China","grantNumber":"61471393, 61501507, 61371122 and 61501512"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"BK20150719 and BK20150718"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415\\14\\22"},{"fundingName":"Newton Institutional Link","grantNumber":"172719890"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Full-Duplex Spectrum-Sharing Wiretap Networks With Different Antenna Reception Schemes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhang-2625257-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146034S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7736105","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7736110,"authors":[{"name":"Shubo Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7805318/7736110/wang-2618010-small.gif","p":["Shubo Wang received the B.S. degree from Binzhou University, Binzhou, China, in 2008, and the M.S. degree from the School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China, 2011.

An improved funnel function is proposed to guarantee the transient and asymptotic behavior of the tracking error within a given funnel boundary. The proposed funnel function removes the imposed assumption used in conventional funnel controls (e.g., systems with relative degree one or two) and avoids the potential singularity problem in prescribed performance controls. Moreover, an extended state observer (ESO) is used to address the effect of unknown dynamics in the control system (e.g., friction and disturbances), where the ESO parameters can be easily designed based on the control system bandwidth. The stability of the proposed control system with ESO and funnel function is analyzed via the Lyapunov theory. Comparative simulations and experimental results are conducted based on a practical turntable servomechanisms to validate the efficacy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2016.2618010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7805318/07736110.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2016.2618010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7805318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended-State-Observer-Based Funnel Control for Nonlinear Servomechanisms With Prescribed Tracking Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736110/","displayDocTitle":"Extended-State-Observer-Based Funnel Control for Nonlinear Servomechanisms With Prescribed Tracking Performance","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618497","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7736110/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61433003, 61273150, 61573174 and 61321002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended-State-Observer-Based Funnel Control for Nonlinear Servomechanisms With Prescribed Tracking Performance","sourcePdf":"tase-wang-2618010-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149926S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7805318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"7805318","articleId":"7736110","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7736113,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00e1n Koloda","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7874231/7736113/kolod-2619581-small.gif","p":["J\u00e1n Koloda (M\u201912) received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in multimedia systems from the University of Granada, Granada, Spain, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a novel scalable spatial EC algorithm that aims at obtaining high quality reconstructions with reduced computational burden. The proposed technique exploits the excellent reconstructing abilities of the kernel-based minimum mean square error (K-MMSE) estimator. We propose to decompose this approach into a set of hierarchically stacked layers. The first layer performs the basic reconstruction that the subsequent layers can eventually refine. In addition, we design a layer management mechanism, based on profiles, that dynamically adapts the use of higher layers to the visual complexity of the area being reconstructed. The proposed technique outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms and produces high quality reconstructions, equivalent to K-MMSE, while requiring around one tenth of its computational time.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2016.2619581","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7874231/07736113.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2016.2619581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","startPage":"59","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Kernel-Based Minimum Mean Square Error Estimator for Accelerated Image Error Concealment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Kernel-Based Minimum Mean Square Error Estimator for Accelerated Image Error Concealment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736113/","volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7736113/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16723047","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Training Group 1773 \u201cHeterogeneous Image Systems,\u201d"},{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG)"},{"fundingName":"Spanish MICINN/MINECO/FEDER Project","grantNumber":"TEC2013-46690-P"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Kernel-Based Minimum Mean Square Error Estimator for Accelerated Image Error Concealment","sourcePdf":"tbc-koloda-2619581-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100878S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7874231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7874231","articleId":"7736113","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7736122,"authors":[{"name":"Lifan Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, NTU"],"bio":{"p":["Lifan Zhao (zhao0145@e.ntu.edu.sg) received his B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2010, and his Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2016.

The DNs can either be connected to a fusion center (referred to as centralized data processing; CDP) or process data independently and communicate with each other via a rate-limited link (referred to as distributed data processing; DDP). In the first stage of this two-stage cophasing scheme, sensors estimate the channel to the DNs using pilot symbols transmitted by the latter; following which they simultaneously transmit multiple streams of data symbols by prerotating them according to the estimated channel phases to the different DNs. The achievable rates for both CDP and DDP are derived to quantify the gains obtainable by the multistream DCP. In order to aid data detection at the receiver, we propose a least-squares-based iterative algorithm for blind channel estimation in CDP-DCP. Following this, we develop a message passing based blind channel estimation algorithm for DDP-DCP. It is found using Monte Carlo simulations that for the CDP system, the proposed blind channel estimation algorithm achieves a probability of error performance very close to that with perfect CSI at the DNs, while using only a moderate number of unknown data symbols for channel estimation. We also derive approximate expressions for the error probability performance of the proposed system for both CDP and DDP and validate their accuracy using Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2625263","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7765219/07736134.pdf","startPage":"1042","endPage":"1057","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2625263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistream Distributed Cophasing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multistream Distributed Cophasing","volume":"65","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16518874","publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7736134/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002183","fundingName":"Department of Electronics and Information Technology Ministry of Communications and Information Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistream Distributed Cophasing","sourcePdf":"tsp-murthy-2625263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088424S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7765219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7765219","articleId":"7736134","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7736135,"authors":[{"name":"Hanjie Pan","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7765219/7736135/pan-2625274-small.gif","p":["Hanjie Pan (S\u201911) was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1988.

The earliest occurrence is the estimation of sinusoids in time series using Prony's method. This is at the root of a substantial line of work on high resolution spectral estimation. The estimation of continuous-time sparse signals from discrete-time samples is the goal of the sampling theory for finite rate of innovation (FRI) signals. Both spectral estimation and FRI sampling usually assume uniform sampling. But not all measurements are obtained uniformly, as exemplified by a concrete radioastronomy problem we set out to solve. Thus, we develop the theory and algorithm to reconstruct sparse signals, typically sum of sinusoids, from nonuniform samples. We achieve this by identifying a linear transformation that relates the unknown uniform samples of sinusoids to the given measurements. These uniform samples are known to satisfy the annihilation equations. A valid solution is then obtained by solving a constrained minimization such that the reconstructed signal is consistent with the given measurements and satisfies the annihilation constraint. Thanks to this new approach, we unify a variety of FRI-based methods. We demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the proposed approach with five FRI reconstruction problems, namely Dirac reconstructions with irregular time or Fourier domain samples, FRI curve reconstructions, Dirac reconstructions on the sphere, and point source reconstructions in radioastronomy. The proposed algorithm improves substantially over state-of-the-art methods and is able to reconstruct point sources accurately from irregularly sampled Fourier measurements under severe noise conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Signal processing algorithms","Estimation","Technological innovation","Robustness","Fourier transforms","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","direction-of-arrival estimation","Fourier series","radioastronomy","signal resolution","signal sampling","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["irregularly sampled Fourier measurements","point source reconstructions","FRI curve reconstructions","Fourier domain samples","irregular time samples","Dirac reconstructions","annihilation constraint","constrained minimization","linear transformation","nonuniform samples","concrete radioastronomy problem","FRI signals","finite rate of innovation signals","sampling theory","discrete-time samples","high resolution spectral estimation","Prony's method","time series","time-of-flight measurement","direction-of-arrival problem","point sources","continuous-time sparse signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite rate of innovation (FRI)","approximation","sparse reconstruction","irregular sampling","continuous-time sparsity","radio interferometry"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2625274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7765219/07736135.pdf","startPage":"821","endPage":"835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2625274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Generalized FRI Sampling With an Application to Source Resolution in Radioastronomy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Generalized FRI Sampling With an Application to Source Resolution in Radioastronomy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736135/","volume":"65","issue":"4","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7736135/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16518856","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"SNF\u201320FP-1_151073"},{"fundingName":"General Research Fund","grantNumber":"CUHK14600615"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grant Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Towards Generalized FRI Sampling With an Application to Source Resolution in Radioastronomy","sourcePdf":"tsp-pan-2625274-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103568S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7765219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7765219","articleId":"7736135","onlineDate":"04 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7736138,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Peng Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Li-Peng","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085510719"},{"name":"Kwok-Keung M.

convection coefficients and input powers are investigated by using finite-element method. Three types of TIMs are conductive silver, Sn63Pb37 of tin alloy solder, and graphene in this paper. The results demonstrate that the temperature of the LED lamp decreases sharply using the interface material of graphene. With the increasing convection coefficient in a certain range, the junction temperature will be effectively decreased. When under high input powers, graphene has a much better performance than other two TIMs. It implies that graphene may be a possible potential for thermal design, which can effectively prolong the life of LED, especially for high power devices. The simulation offers a test of LED heat dissipation using different TIMs, and the results can provide a reference for the application of graphene in LED thermal design as TIMs and build a motivation for future material research directions. It builds a basis for progressive study of physical property for LED lamp.

To enable WiFi transmission in UHF bands, we design WATCH-interference cancellation and constructive addition transmission to 1) exploit the unique environment of asynchronous WiFi transmission in the presence of a strong streaming interferer, and 2) require no coordination with legacy TV transmitters.

Once Kilobots were made public in 2012, they have instantly become a valuable tool for empirical validation of swarm robotics and an entertaining instrument for educational demonstrations. However, although the original designs were publicly available, when the authors initially built the Kilobots by following the instructions, several issues occurred. The most challenging issue was about the calibration board. The authors reached out to several research groups world-wide and found out that others encountered similar issues. Most groups purchased their Kilobots from K-Team at a much higher price and with a long waiting time in the ordering process, defeating the purpose of Kilobots being inexpensive micro-robots that are quick to build. The authors were inspired to revise the design of the Kilobots, to make them truly accessible to all the researchers and educators around the world. The redesign is not an overhaul of the original design; instead, it is aimed at making the building process of Kilobots feasible and time-efficient. The main areas of the redesign are in PCB layout, distance calibration, and the associated documentation update. During the redesign process, the authors were very grateful for the help received from the inventors of the Kilobots and several other research groups. The final design has been tested in house and in another research group.

Some data of different provinces have been obtained, the health level can be acquired by RBF neural networks. The mathematical model of agricultural machinery is difficult to be proposed in this paper, so the traditional control algorithm can't be used in agricultural machinery. However, the RBF neural networks can solve this problem. At the same time, some vital factors should be considered, such as mileages, rotational speed, stubble height, water temperature, oil pressure of agricultural machinery. The rotational speed and stubble height have a big effect on fault prediction of agriculture. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ARSO.2016.7736285","startPage":"221","endPage":"225","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts (ARSO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7602793/7736245/07736285.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts (ARSO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARSO.2016.7736285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A state and fault prediction method based on RBF neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Velocity control","Fault diagnosis","Prognostics and health management","Monitoring","Agricultural machinery","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agricultural machinery","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state and fault prediction method","RBF neural networks","agricultural machinery","mathematical model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A state and fault prediction method based on RBF neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7736285/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16429023","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A state and fault prediction method based on RBF neural networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151749S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7602793","isNumber":"7736245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602793","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7736245","articleId":"7736285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7736286,"authors":[{"name":"Ren C.

Furthermore, the sparseness of the corresponding parity check matrix of 1-level QC-LDPC lattices and their good error performance, make them efficient choices in real world applications. In this paper, we propose a Rao-Nam like encryption scheme using 1-level QC-LDPC lattices. Some chosen-plaintext attacks and recent results on the Rao-Nam scheme are considered over the proposed scheme. Our scheme is secure against the chosen plaintext attack and it is efficient because of its high information rate and low overhead of the encryption and decryption algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2016.7736446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCISC.2016.7736446","startPage":"20","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"2016 13th International Iranian Society of Cryptology Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th International Iranian Society of Cryptology Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7604981/7736436/07736446.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A secret key encryption scheme based on 1-level QC-LDPC lattices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736446/","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A secret key encryption scheme based on 1-level QC-LDPC lattices","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16429090","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7736446/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A secret key encryption scheme based on 1-level QC-LDPC lattices","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087742S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7604981","isNumber":"7736436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7604981","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7736436","articleId":"7736446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-24"},{"_id":7736447,"authors":[{"name":"Abolfazl Zargar","affiliation":["Parsa Sharif Research Center, Tehran, Iran","Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abolfazl","lastName":"Zargar","id":"37085906690"},{"name":"Alireza Nowroozi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Nowroozi","id":"37085617639"},{"name":"Rasool Jalili","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Rasool","lastName":"Jalili","id":"37281583600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3949-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3950-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7736447","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":401},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic mail","IP networks","Organizations","Telecommunication traffic","Servers","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","risk analysis","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XABA","zero-knowledge anomaly","behavior analysis","insider threat detection","security risk","activity log analysis","big-stream platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Insider Threat","Attack Detection","Behavior Analysis","Traitor"]}],"abstract":"Insider threat is a significant security risk for organizations and hard to detect. Most introduced detection methods need contextual data entries about users, or preprocessed user activity logs to detect insider threats which it is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a behavior analysis method that learns its context and detects multiple types of insider threats from raw logs and network traffic in real-time. This method, named XABA, learns user roles and exclusive behaviors, through analyzing raw logs related to each network session of the user. Then it checks for some abnormal patterns, and if so, triggers the appropriate alert. XABA is implemented on the big-stream platform to operate on high rates of network sessions. To evaluate XABA, a real traitor scenario is designed and detected with low false positive. XABA can detect diverse types of scenarios in many contexts without any predefined information or preprocessed activity logs.","doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2016.7736447","publicationTitle":"2016 13th International Iranian Society of Cryptology Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th International Iranian Society of Cryptology Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7604981/7736436/07736447.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCISC.2016.7736447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"XABA: A zero-knowledge anomaly-based behavioral analysis method to detect insider threats","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736447/","displayDocTitle":"XABA: A zero-knowledge anomaly-based behavioral analysis method to detect insider threats","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429095","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7736447/","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"XABA: A zero-knowledge anomaly-based behavioral analysis method to detect insider threats","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086841S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7604981","isNumber":"7736436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7604981","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7736436","articleId":"7736447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7736459,"authors":[{"name":"Sharareh ZamanZadeh","affiliation":["Computer Science and Eng.

Field-programmability of FPGAs is an effective feature in the growth and diversity of their applications but it has caused security concerns for IPs/Designs on FPGAs. Bitstream is a binary file which is generated at the end of the last stage of FPGA design flow. Unfortunately, there is a straightforward and quite relationship between the bitstream and design knowledge. This matter is considered as a security disadvantage in reverse engineering attack. In this paper we analyze this vulnerability and provide a solution to complicate the coding of the bitstream to hinder reverse engineering of FPGAs. In our proposed solution, the architecture of the bitstream encoding is changed and some select pins are added to the multiplexers inside the switch boxes. This modification causes a new coding method for bitstream. In this way the existing peer-to-peer relationship between the design and its bitstream would be disturbed. The experimental results show that with a negligible overhead, this coding method is able to improve the obfuscation level of the bitstream and hamper the reverse engineering attack.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security improvement of FPGA configuration file against the reverse engineering attack","doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2016.7736459","startPage":"101","endPage":"105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCISC.2016.7736459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736436","publicationTitle":"2016 13th International Iranian Society of Cryptology Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th International Iranian Society of Cryptology Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7604981/7736436/07736459.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Security improvement of FPGA configuration file against the reverse engineering attack","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7736459/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429088","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security improvement of FPGA configuration file against the reverse engineering attack","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042684S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7604981","isNumber":"7736436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7604981","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7736436","articleId":"7736459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7736615,"authors":[{"name":"Zaher Dawy","affiliation":["American University of Beirut"],"bio":{"p":["Zaher Dawy [M'97, SM' received the B.E. degree in computer and communications engineering from the American University of Beirut (AUB), Beirut, Lebanon, in 1998, and the M.S. and Dr.-Ing. degrees in communications engineering from Munich University of Technology (TUM), Munich, Germany, in 2000 and 2004, respectively.

Automated devices such as sensors, tracking devices, and meters, often referred to as machine-to-machine (M2M) or machine-type communications (MTC), introduce an attractive revenue stream for mobile network operators, if a massive number of them can be efficiently supported. The novel technical challenges posed by MTC applications include increased overhead and control signaling as well as diverse application-specific constraints such as ultra-low complexity, extreme energy efficiency, critical timing, and continuous data intensive uploading. This article explains the new requirements and challenges that large-scale MTC applications introduce, and provides a survey of key techniques for overcoming them. We focus on the potential of 4.5G and 5G networks to serve both the high data rate needs of conventional human-type communication (HTC) subscribers and the forecasted billions of new MTC devices. We also opine on attractive economic models that will enable this new class of cellular subscribers to grow to its full potential.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2017","volume":"24","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16706703","dateOfInsertion":"28 February 2017","publicationDate":"February 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7736615/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Toward Massive Machine Type Cellular Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Massive Machine Type Cellular Communications","sourcePdf":"025DAWY_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077619S","chronDate":"February  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7864773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"242","xplore-issue":"7864773","articleId":"7736615","onlineDate":"07 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":7736616,"authors":[{"name":"Guangjie Han","affiliation":["Hohai University"],"bio":{"p":["Guangjie Han [s'01, M'05] (hanguangjie@gmail.com) is currently a professor in the Department of Information and Communication Systems at Hohai University, China.

This belief is mainly based on the results of experiments made on thin XLPE samples with different heat-treatments; but since heat-treatment also influences the morphology of the polymer, it is necessary to consider this effect as well. It is common to use polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film as a protective layer during sample press molding. Studies on the influence of the pressing film on the electrical properties of the sample are rare. In this work, the results of a series of experiments performed on 0.5 mm thick XLPE plaque samples in reference to additive free LDPE samples with different heat-treatment times are presented. Beside the PDP content, the morphology, DC conductivity and polarization properties are studied and analyzed. It was found that the pressing film used during sample preparation has a significant effect on the results and if not corrected, it may lead to wrong conclusions about the influence of the PDP content. Eliminating the effect of the pressing film, no clear correlation between the DC conductivity, dielectric loss and the PDP content was observed. The relation between the PDP content and DC conductivity is not found to be obvious, hence this correlation may need to be further evaluated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7736807/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2016","publicationDate":"October 2016","accessionNumber":"16448587","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effect of heat-treatment and sample preparation on physical properties of XLPE DC cable insulation material","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of heat-treatment and sample preparation on physical properties of XLPE DC cable insulation material","sourcePdf":"p2508_ghorbani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058491S","chronDate":"October  2016","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7736800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7736800","articleId":"7736807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7736817,"authors":[{"name":"Lipeng Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/7736800/7736817/7736817-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lipeng Zhong was born in Hunan Province, China in January, 1990.

In most cases, alumina of micro range is blended to improve mechanical properties as well as reduce expenses, etc. However, apart from benefits, the incorporation of micro-particles could alter surface electric behaviors due to the change in material structures and the surface trap distribution under operating condition. Therefore, the surface charge behavior under dc is changed as well, which can affect the surface flashover characteristic. Direct fluorination is a method to change surface properties by introducing stable C-F structure to the surface of the dielectric material. The newly formed fluorinated layer could bring changes to electrical characteristics, thus affecting surface electrical properties under dc stress. In this paper, samples are prepared using alumina casted epoxy resin composites. The two parts are blended using the same process used to produce cone-type insulators in gasinsulated substations (GIS) in industrial application. Experiment samples were treated with F2 /N2 mixture containing 12.5% F2 in volume at 50 \u00b0C under 0.1MPa. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to investigate surface physicochemical characteristics. Water and diiodomethane droplet contact angles were measured and surface energies were calculated. The distribution of the surface voltage potential, as well as the surface conductivity and DC flashover voltage were measured. Experiment results confirmed that the fluorination to epoxy resin and alumina composites can change the surface morphology by changing the exposed area of surface alumina particles. It also showed that fluorinated samples have higher DC flashover voltage in both air and SF6 due to the combined effect of the change in the surface morphology and the surface conductivity.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2016.7736871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/7736800/07736871.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2016.7736871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736800","startPage":"3071","endPage":"3077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface morphology and electrical characteristics of direct fluorinated epoxy-resin/alumina composite","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Surface morphology and electrical characteristics of direct fluorinated epoxy-resin/alumina composite","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736871/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2016","accessionNumber":"16448575","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7736871/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface morphology and electrical characteristics of direct fluorinated epoxy-resin/alumina composite","sourcePdf":"p3071_li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063891S","chronDate":"October  2016","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7736800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7736800","articleId":"7736871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7736902,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Galea","affiliation":["Department of Communications & Computer Engineering, University of Malta, Msida, Malta, Europe"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Galea","id":"37076183600"},{"name":"Reuben A.

Liveness Detection Using CNN Features of Random Sample Patches","abstract":"As a result of the growing use of commercial fingerprint authentication systems in mobile devices, detection of fingerprint spoofing has become increasingly important and widely used. This study proposes a fingerprint liveness- detection method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) features extracted from fingerprint patches. Firstly, fingerprints are segmented, and then data augmentation is performed to increase the size of training data. Secondly, on the augmented fingerprint, locations of patches are determined through normal distributions of segmented areas of the fingerprint image. Finally, a voting strategy is applied on all patches to make a decision of live or fake fingerprints. Experimental results show that the proposed method can be applied to fingerprint liveness detection with a 3.42% average classification error rate on a LivDet2009 Identix sensor dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429136","htmlLink":"/document/7736923/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint Liveness Detection Using CNN Features of Random Sample Patches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint Liveness Detection Using CNN Features of Random Sample Patches","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"pid1184220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055943S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736796","isNumber":"7736893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736796","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7736893","articleId":"7736923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Gesellschaft fuer Informatik","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7736924,"authors":[{"name":"Samil Karahan","affiliation":["TUBITAK BILGEM, Gebze, Kocaeli, TURKEY","TUBITAK BILGEM, Gebze, Kocaeli, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Samil","lastName":"Karahan","id":"37061892200"},{"name":"Merve Kilinc Yildirum","affiliation":["Ulusal Elektronik ve Kriptoloji Arastirma Enstitusu, Kocaeli, TR"],"firstName":"Merve","lastName":"Kilinc Yildirum"},{"name":"Kadir Kirtac","affiliation":["TUBITAK BILGEM, Gebze, Kocaeli, TURKEY","TUBITAK BILGEM, Gebze, Kocaeli, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Kadir","lastName":"Kirtac","id":"38109011400"},{"name":"Ferhat Sukru Rende","affiliation":["TUBITAK BILGEM, Gebze, Kocaeli, TURKEY","TUBITAK BILGEM, Gebze, Kocaeli, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Ferhat Sukru","lastName":"Rende","id":"37085892120"},{"name":"Gultekin Butun","affiliation":["TUBITAK BILGEM, Gebze, Kocaeli, TURKEY","TUBITAK BILGEM, Gebze, Kocaeli, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Gultekin","lastName":"Butun","id":"37085896034"},{"name":"Hazim Kemal Ekenel","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Informatics, Dept. of Computer Engineering, Maslak, Istanbul, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Hazim Kemal","lastName":"Ekenel","id":"37546749500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-8857-9654-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0780-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7736924","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":853},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Face recognition","Distortion","Colored noise","Degradation","Face","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep CNN-based face recognition","deep convolutional neural network","in-the-wild dataset","image quality degradation","image motion blur","image noise","image compression artifacts","image color distortions","image occlusion","standard LFW closed-set identification protocol","AlexNet model","VGG-Face model","GoogLeNet model"]}],"abstract":"Face recognition approaches that are based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been dominating the field. The performance improvements they have provided in the so called in-the-wild datasets are significant, however, their performance under image quality degradations have not been assessed, yet. This is particularly important, since in real-world face recognition applications, images may contain various kinds of degradations due to motion blur, noise, compression artifacts, color distortions, and occlusion. In this work, we have addressed this problem and analyzed the influence of these image degradations on the performance of deep CNN-based face recognition approaches using the standard LFW closed-set identification protocol. We have evaluated three popular deep CNN models, namely, the AlexNet, VGG-Face, and GoogLeNet. Results have indicated that blur, noise, and occlusion cause a significant decrease in performance, while deep CNN models are found to be robust to distortions, such as color distortions and change in color balance.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736796/7736893/07736924.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How Image Degradations Affect Deep CNN-Based Face Recognition?","doi":"10.1109/BIOSIG.2016.7736924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOSIG.2016.7736924","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"How Image Degradations Affect Deep CNN-Based Face Recognition?","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429107","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7736924/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How Image Degradations Affect Deep CNN-Based Face Recognition?","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"pid1184256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051563S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736796","isNumber":"7736893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736796","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7736893","articleId":"7736924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Gesellschaft fuer Informatik","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7736925,"authors":[{"name":"Gokhan Ozbulak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gokhan","lastName":"Ozbulak","id":"37085889725"},{"name":"Yusuf Aytar","affiliation":["CSAIL, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Yusuf","lastName":"Aytar","id":"37939439200"},{"name":"Hazim Kemal Ekenel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hazim Kemal","lastName":"Ekenel","id":"37085895087"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-8857-9654-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0780-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7736925","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1029},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7736925","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Estimation","Computational modeling","Support vector machines","Benchmark testing","Convolution","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN-based features","age classification","gender classification","soft biometric traits","face recognition","age estimation","gender estimation","facial images","deep convolutional neural networks based representation","transferability","AlexNet architecture","VGG-face CNN model","Adience dataset","GilNet CNN model"]}],"abstract":"Age and gender are complementary soft biometric traits for face recognition. Successful estimation of age and gender from facial images taken under real-world conditions can contribute improving the identification results in the wild. In this study, in order to achieve robust age and gender classification in the wild, we have benefited from Deep Convolutional Neural Networks based representation. We have explored transferability of existing deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for age and gender classification. The generic AlexNet-like architecture and domain specific VGG-Face CNN model are employed and fine-tuned with the Adience dataset prepared for age and gender classification in uncontrolled environments. In addition, task specific GilNet CNN model has also been utilized and used as a baseline method in order to compare with transferred models. Experimental results show that both transferred deep CNN models outperform the GilNet CNN model, which is the state-of-the-art age and gender classification approach on the Adience dataset, by an absolute increase of 7% and 4.5% in accuracy, respectively. This outcome indicates that transferring a deep CNN model can provide better classification performance than a task specific CNN model, which has a limited number of layers and trained from scratch using a limited amount of data as in the case of GilNet. Domain specific VGG-Face CNN model has been found to be more useful and provided better performance for both age and gender classification tasks, when compared with generic AlexNet-like model, which shows that transfering from a closer domain is more useful.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736796/7736893/07736925.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOSIG.2016.7736925","doi":"10.1109/BIOSIG.2016.7736925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How Transferable Are CNN-Based Features for Age and Gender Classification?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"How Transferable Are CNN-Based Features for Age and Gender Classification?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736925/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7736925/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429104","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How Transferable Are CNN-Based Features for Age and Gender Classification?","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"pid1184268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117313S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736796","isNumber":"7736893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736796","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7736893","articleId":"7736925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Gesellschaft fuer Informatik","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7736936,"authors":[{"name":"Artur Costa-Pazo","affiliation":["GRADIANT - Galician Research & Development Center in Advanced Telecommunications CITEXVI, Spain"],"firstName":"Artur","lastName":"Costa-Pazo","id":"37075598300"},{"name":"Sushil Bhattacharjee","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Centre du Parc, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sushil","lastName":"Bhattacharjee","id":"37085898763"},{"name":"Esteban Vazquez-Fernandez","affiliation":["GRADIANT - Galician Research & Development Center in Advanced Telecommunications CITEXVI, Spain"],"firstName":"Esteban","lastName":"Vazquez-Fernandez","id":"38274372900"},{"name":"Sebastien Marcel","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Centre du Parc, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sebastien","lastName":"Marcel","id":"37270970400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-8857-9654-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0780-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7736936","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":494},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Databases","Face","Cameras","Smart phones","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image texture","mobile handsets","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["replay-mobile face presentation-attack database","face authentication","face presentation-attack detection","face-PAD methods","mobile devices","face-PAD problem","image quality analysis","face texture analysis","face recognition"]}],"abstract":"For face authentication to become widespread on mobile devices, robust countermeasures must be developed for face presentation-attack detection (PAD).

In conventional WPD, each node operates in three different modes, namely, packet transmitting (Tx), data receiving, and sleeping modes. However, since the sleeping nodes neither transmit nor receive data, to make more efficient use of the resources, we consider a scenario where the sleeping nodes harvest energy from the signals radiated by the Tx nodes. First, we analyze the average number of discovered peers (ADP) and the amount of energy harvested per unit area as a function of the node densities. Then, we examine the ADP performance by addressing an ADP maximizing problem under the energy harvesting constraints, which is difficult to solve due to non-convexity. To tackle the problem, we focus on the asymptotic performance in the interference-limited scenario and provide an insightful closed-form solution. Numerical simulations confirm that our solution achieves near-optimal performance over all levels of interference with reduced complexity.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2625782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2625782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7874222/07736971.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Probability Designs for Wireless Peer Discovery With Energy Harvesting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Probability Designs for Wireless Peer Discovery With Energy Harvesting","volume":"21","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7736971/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16723213","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7736971/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korea Government (MSIP)"},{"fundingName":"Korea Government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2014R1A2A1A10049769 and 2015R1C1A1A02036927"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Probability Designs for Wireless Peer Discovery With Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"lcomm-lee-2625782-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067918S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7874222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7874222","articleId":"7736971","onlineDate":"07 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7736982,"authors":[{"name":"Hampei Sasahara","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hampei","lastName":"Sasahara","id":"37085492900"},{"name":"Kazunori Hayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37277906800"},{"name":"Masaaki Nagahara","affiliation":["Institute of Environmental Science and Technology, University of Kitakyushu, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Nagahara","id":"37274787900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7736982","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":454},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a new symbol detection method in faster-than-Nyquist signaling for effective data transmission.

We describe a distributed algorithm in which each transmitter iteratively adapts its complex transmit weight using common aggregate feedback messages broadcast by the targets, and the local knowledge of only its own channel gains to the targets. This knowledge can be obtained using reciprocity without any explicit feedback. The algorithm minimizes the mean square error between the complex signal amplitudes at the targets and their desired values. We prove convergence of the algorithm, present geometric interpretations, characterize initializations that lead to minimum total transmit power, and prescribe designs for such initializations. We show that the convergence speed is nondecreasing in the number of transmitters N if a step size parameter is kept constant. For Rayleigh fading channels, as N goes to infinity: 1) convergence can be made arbitrarily fast and 2) beams and nulls can be achieved with vanishing total transmit power even with noise, both with probability one. These results add up to some remarkable scalability properties: the feedback overhead does not grow with the number of transmitters, and with high probability, the algorithm can be configured to converge arbitrarily fast and use vanishingly small total transmit power.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2625784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless

However, in fluoroscopic images, visualization of the vasculature requires toxic contrast agent. Static vasculature roadmapping, which can reduce the usage of iodine contrast, is hampered by the breathing motion in abdominal catheterization. In this paper, we propose a method to track the catheter tip inside the patient's 3D vessel tree using intra-operative single-plane 2D X-ray image sequences and a peri-operative 3D rotational angiography (3DRA). The method is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) where states of the model are the possible positions of the catheter tip inside the 3D vessel tree. The transitions from state to state model the probabilities for the catheter tip to move from one position to another. The HMM is updated following the observation scores, based on the registration between the 2D catheter centerline extracted from the 2D X-ray image, and the 2D projection of 3D vessel tree centerline extracted from the 3DRA. The method is extensively evaluated on simulated and clinical datasets acquired during liver abdominal catheterization. The evaluations show a median 3D tip tracking error of 2.3 mm with optimal settings in simulated data.

The core modulator architecture is a cascade of two singleloop second-order CT\u03a3\u0394M stages, each of which consists of an integrator-based active-RC loop filter, current-steering feedback digital-to-analog converters, and a 4-b flash quantizer. On-chip RC time constant calibration circuits and high-gain multistage operational amplifiers are realized to mitigate quantization noise leakage due to process variation. Multiple feedforward interstage paths are introduced to: 1) synthesize a fourth-order noise transfer function with dc zeros; 2) simplify the design of NCF; and 3) reduce signal swings at the second-stage integrator outputs. Fully integrated in 40-nm CMOS, the prototype chip achieves 74.4 dB of signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR), 75.8 dB of signal-to-noise ratio, and 76.8 dB of dynamic range in 50.3 MHz of bandwidth (BW) at 1 GHz of sampling frequency with 43 mW of power consumption (P) from 1.1/1.15/2.5-V power supplies.

This paper proposed a complete strategy aims to perform pre- and post- processing for surface crack detection based on ECPT platform. In addition, the quantitative evaluation is involved to objectively evaluate detectability. Specially, a new post-image segmentation algorithm is proposed which based on the idea of grouping histogram and iterative adaption approach that leads to better performance for quantitatively identifying and sizing the defect. Experimental tests on man-made metal and natural defects have been conducted to show the reliability of the proposed strategy.

However, as a pixel-based method, the traditional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection could not work well for the ship target detection problem of multiple ship targets with different sizes in a SAR image, which is referred to as the multiscale situation. Moreover, it needs to use the clustering method on the pixel-level detection results to obtain the accurate target regions, which may merge two or more different targets into a target region. In this letter, a modified CFAR based on object proposals is proposed. We use the object proposal generator to generate a small set of object proposals with different sizes, and then use the proposal-based CFAR detector, where the extracted object proposals are regarded as the guard windows instead of setting fixed guard window, to detect the true positive object proposals. By introducing the object proposals as the variable guard windows in the CFAR detector, the proposed algorithm could gain good detection performance in the multiscale situation, since the missed detection resulting from the big differences between the sizes of the fixed guard window and ship targets can be avoided. Meanwhile, the proposed method can directly obtain the accurate target regions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified using the measured SAR data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7778340/07737020.pdf","startPage":"1925","endPage":"1929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2016.2618604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2016.2618604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified CFAR Algorithm Based on Object Proposals for Ship Target Detection in SAR Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Marine vehicles","Synthetic aperture radar","Object detection","Detectors","Training","Clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","object detection","remote sensing by radar","ships","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clustering method","constant false alarm rate detection","synthetic aperture radar","SAR Images","ship target detection","object proposals","modified CFAR algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm","object proposals","ship target detection","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Modified CFAR Algorithm Based on Object Proposals for Ship Target Detection in SAR Images","volume":"13","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7737020/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16524389","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271024 and 61322103"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for Doctoral Supervisor, China","grantNumber":"20130203110013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2015JZ016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified CFAR Algorithm Based on Object Proposals for Ship Target Detection in SAR Images","sourcePdf":"lgrs-du-2618604-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076571S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7778340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7778340","articleId":"7737020","onlineDate":"07 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7737024,"authors":[{"name":"Ramtin Zand","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/7809217/7737024/zand-2625749-small.gif","p":["Ramtin Zand received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from\n Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran, in 2010 and the M.Sc. degree in digital electronics from the\n Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2012.

However, the performance degradation, limited endurance and immature mass production of ultra-high-density SCM are still the painful points of BSLD. Here we propose a Retention-Aware Hybrid Main Memory (RAHMM) architecture with a big DRAM and a little SCM (BDLS) for the first time. DRAM is refreshed at a much longer interval by using SCM to store the small quantity of leaky tail bits in DRAM.

This contribution proposes a location-aware channel estimation-enhanced massive MIMO system employing time-division duplexing protocol, which is capable of significantly reducing the inter-cell interference caused by PC and, therefore, improving the achievable system performance. Specifically, we present a novel location-aware channel estimation algorithm, which utilizes the property of the steering vector to carry out a fast Fourier transform-based post-processing after the conventional pilot-aided channel estimation for mitigating PC. Our asymptotic analysis proves that this post-processing is capable of removing PC from the interfering users with different angle-of-arrivals (AOAs). Since in practice the AOAs of some users may be similar, we further present a location-aware pilot assignment method to ensure that users utilizing the same pilot have distinguishable AOAs, in order to fully benefit from the location-aware channel estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can dramatically reduce the inter-cell interference caused by the re-use of the pilot sequence and improve the overall system performance significantly, while only imposing a modest extra computational cost, in comparison with the conventional pilot-aided channel estimation.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2625306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07737031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2625306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","startPage":"7828","endPage":"7840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location-Aware Channel Estimation Enhanced TDD Based Massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Location-Aware Channel Estimation Enhanced TDD Based Massive MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2016","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16509351","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7737031/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571267"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005089","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4142027"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Peacock Plan","grantNumber":"1108170036003286"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Subject Arrangements","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160331184124954"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Location-Aware Channel Estimation Enhanced TDD Based Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"access-zhao-2625306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133236S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7737031","onlineDate":"07 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7737032,"authors":[{"name":"Kateryna Zinchenko","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7904755/7737032/zinch-2625818-small.gif","p":["Kateryna Zinchenko (S\u201916) was born in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 1991.\n She received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2013,\n where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science.","Her research interests include surgical robots, swarm robotics, shared control, artificial intelligence, VR.","Ms. Zinchenko's received the Best Student Paper Nomination (CACS 2014, Taiwan), the System and Architecture\n Talent Training Program Award (MOE 2014, Taiwan), and the Best Student Paper Award (ICCAS 2015, Korea)."]},"firstName":"Kateryna","lastName":"Zinchenko","id":"37085754580"},{"name":"Chien-Yu Wu","affiliation":["Industry 4.0 Division, Fair Friend Group, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7904755/7737032/wu-2625818-small.gif","p":["Chien-Yu Wu received the M.S. degree in electrical control\n engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2015.","He had an internship with the Institute of Mechatronic Systems in Leibniz University, Hannover, Germany.

For minimally invasive surgical robotic assistants, this ambiguity arises because the robotic motion is not calibrated to the camera images. This paper presents a design for a speech recognition interface for an HIWIN robotic endoscope holder. A new intentional speech control is proposed to control movement over long distances. To decrease ambiguity, a method is proposed for voice-to-motion calibration that compares the degree of change in the endoscope image for a voice command. A speech recognition algorithm is implemented on Ubuntu OS, using CMU Sphinx. The control signal is sent to the robot controller using serial-port communication through a RS232 cable. The experimental results show that the proposed intentional speech control strategy has a navigation precision of up to 3.1\u00b0 of angular displacement for the endoscope. The overall system processing time, including robotic motion, is 3.22 s for ~1.8-s speech duration. The reference image navigation range is from 2.5 mm for ~0.5-s speech duration up to 6 mm for ~1.8-s speech duration, using a setup with camera tip that is located at a distance of 5 cm from the remote center of motion point.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7904755/07737032.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on Speech Recognition Control for a Surgical Robot","doi":"10.1109/TII.2016.2625818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2016.2625818","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737032/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Study on Speech Recognition Control for a Surgical Robot","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16823947","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7737032/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2221-E-009-185"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on Speech Recognition Control for a Surgical Robot","sourcePdf":"tii-song-2625818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072665S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7904755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7904755","articleId":"7737032","onlineDate":"07 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7737034,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaonan Wang","affiliation":["Changshu Institute of Technology, Changshu, Jiangsu, CN"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaonan Wang, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Xiaonan","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-7827-3170"},{"name":"Xiaojian Zhu","affiliation":["Changshu Institute of Technology, Changshu, Jiangsu, CN"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaojian Zhu, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Xiaojian","lastName":"Zhu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-8184"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-9234"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7816"}],"articleNumber":"7737034","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems Council","url":"http://www.ieeesystemscouncil.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anycast-Based Content-Centric MANET","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737034","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile ad hoc networks","Unicast","IP networks","Routing","Mobile nodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile ad hoc networks","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ACCM","content acquisition success rate","anycast group","consumer","desired contents","nearest anycast member","requested contents","content acquisition failure","content acquisition cost reduction","anycast-based content-centric MANET"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anycast","content-centric","mobile ad hoc network (MANET)","unicast"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an ancyast-based content-centric MANET (ACCM) to reduce the content acquisition cost and to improve the content acquisition success rate.

great potential for the fabrication of three-dimensional (3-D) micro- and nanomechanical elements, for applications ranging from microelectromechanical systems to tissue engineering, by virtue of its high resolution (<;100 nm) and biocompatibility of the photosensitive resists. However, there is a considerable lack of quantitative data on mechanical properties of materials for 2P lithography and of structures obtained through this technique. In this paper, we combined static and dynamic mechanical analysis on purpose-designed microstructures (microbending of pillar-like structures and picometer-sensitive laser Doppler vibrometry of drum-like structures) to viably and nondestructively estimate Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density of materials for 2P lithography. This allowed us to analyze several polymeric photoresists, including acrylates and epoxy-based materials. The experiments reveal that the 2P exposure power is a key parameter to define the stiffness of the realized structures, with hyperelasticity clearly observable for high-power polymerization. In the linear elastic regime, some of the investigated materials are characterized by a quasi-linear dependence of Young's modulus on the used exposure power, a yet unknown behavior that adds a new degree of freedom to engineer complex 3-D micro- and nanomechanical elements.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2016.2625820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2016.2625820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/7809217/07737036.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanical Properties Tunability of Three-Dimensional Polymeric Structures in Two-Photon Lithography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Mechanical Properties Tunability of Three-Dimensional Polymeric Structures in Two-Photon Lithography","volume":"16","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737036/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16597932","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737036/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research"},{"fundingName":"Project entitled Infrastructure Project","grantNumber":"PONa3_00077"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanical Properties Tunability of Three-Dimensional Polymeric Structures in Two-Photon Lithography","sourcePdf":"tnano-lemma-2625820-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127364S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"7809217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7809217","articleId":"7737036","onlineDate":"07 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7737037,"authors":[{"name":"Kejie Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"firstName":"Kejie","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37085375883"},{"name":"Fangyi Zhang","affiliation":["Australian Research Council, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Fangyi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085383676"},{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085398677"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9932"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-223X"}],"articleNumber":"7737037","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1318},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Electron tubes","Signal resolution","Fingerprint recognition","Photonics","Light sources","Localization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","free-space optical communication","light emitting diodes","mobile computing","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian localization","light-signal decomposition","LED lights","modulated light-emitting diode lights","low-cost indoor localization","visible-light beacons","visible light communication","VLC-based localization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Let the Light Guide Us: VLC-Based Localization","doi":"10.1109/MRA.2016.2591833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7786799","endPage":"183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/100/7786799/07737037.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2016.2591833","startPage":"174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737037","abstract":"We propose to use visible-light beacons for low-cost indoor localization.

Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1\u00d7 and 7.8\u00d7 were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18% for lossy and 53% for lossless transmission respectively.

However, previous works on HB are limited to a single user equipment (UE) or a single group of UEs, employing the frequency-flat first-level analog beamforming (AB) that cannot be applied to multiple groups of UEs served in different frequency resources in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. In this paper, a novel HB algorithm with unified AB based on the spatial covariance matrix (SCM) knowledge of all UEs is proposed for a massive MIMO-OFDM system in order to support multiple groups of UEs. The proposed HB method with a much smaller number of RF chains can achieve more than 95% performance of full digital beamforming. In addition, a novel practical subspace construction (SC) algorithm based on partial channel state information is proposed to estimate the required SCM. The proposed SC method can offer more than 97% performance of the perfect SCM case. With the proposed methods, significant cost and power savings can be achieved without large loss in performance. Furthermore, the proposed methods can be applied to massive MIMO-OFDM systems in both time-division duplex and frequency-division duplex.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2625794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2625794","startPage":"594","endPage":"607","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07737056.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Beamforming Algorithm With Unified Analog Beamforming by Subspace Construction Based on Partial CSI for Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Beamforming Algorithm With Unified Analog Beamforming by Subspace Construction Based on Partial CSI for Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16669128","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7737056/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Hybrid Beamforming Algorithm With Unified Analog Beamforming by Subspace Construction Based on Partial CSI for Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-li-2625794-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1399S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7737056","onlineDate":"07 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7737058,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantin D.

The sensor can be fully depleted by means of reverse bias applied to the substrate, and the principle of operation is applicable to very thick sensitive volumes. Additional n-type implants under the in-pixel p-wells have been added to the manufacturing process in order to eliminate the large parasitic substrate current that would otherwise be present in a normal device. The new design shows the same electro-optical performance as the PPD pixel it is based on, and can be fully depleted without significant leakage currents. This development has the potential to greatly increase the quantum efficiency of scientific PPD CIS at near-infrared and soft X-ray wavelengths.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/7802592/07737058.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/LED.2016.2625745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2016.2625745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7802592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully Depleted Pinned Photodiode CMOS Image Sensor With Reverse Substrate Bias","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Implants","Electric potential","Leakage currents","Dark current","Photodiodes","CMOS image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","leakage currents","photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully depleted pinned photodiode CMOS image sensor","reverse substrate bias","manufacturing process","leakage currents","near-infrared wavelengths","soft X-ray wavelengths","size 180 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS image sensor (CIS)","pinned photodiode (PPD)","full depletion","reverse bias"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fully Depleted Pinned Photodiode CMOS Image Sensor With Reverse Substrate Bias","volume":"38","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7737058/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16581327","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.K. Space Agency","grantNumber":"RP10G0348A01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Depleted Pinned Photodiode CMOS Image Sensor With Reverse Substrate Bias","sourcePdf":"led-stefanov-2625745-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071853S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"7802592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7802592","articleId":"7737058","onlineDate":"07 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7737064,"authors":[{"name":"Hanbing Yao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7737064/yao-2622299-small.gif","p":["Hanbing Yao received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2006.

In order to protect data privacy, the sensitive data have to be encrypted, which increases the heavy computational overhead and brings great challenges to resource-constraint devices. In this paper, we propose secure index based on counting Bloom filter (CBF) for ranked multiple keywords search. In the proposed scheme, several algorithms are designed to maintain and lookup CBF, while a pruning algorithm is used to delete the repeated items for saving the space. Besides, the relevance scores are encrypted by the Paillier cryptosystem. It ensures that the same relevance scores are encrypted into different bits, which can resist the statistical analyses on the ciphertext of the relevance scores. Moreover, since the Paillier cryptosystem supports the homomorphic addition of ciphertext without the knowledge of the private key, the major computing work in ranking could be moved from user side to the cloud server side. Therefore, the proposed scheme has huge potentials in resource-constraint mobile devices such as 5G mobile terminals. Security analyses prove that the proposed scheme can prevent the information leakage. Experiment results guarantee that computation overhead of the proposed scheme in user side is low.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2622299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2622299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07737064.pdf","startPage":"9119","endPage":"9128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"Secure Index for Resource-Constraint Mobile Devices in Cloud Computing","volume":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16606840","htmlLink":"/document/7737064/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601337"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015III015-B04 and 2015IVA034"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Key Project of Nature Science Foundation of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"ZRZ2015000393"},{"fundingName":"National Key Technology Support Program of China","grantNumber":"2012BAH45B01"},{"fundingName":"Science & Technology Pillar Program of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2014BAA146"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Key Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China","grantNumber":"2015CFA069"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Secure Index for Resource-Constraint Mobile Devices in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"access-zhou-2622299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106732S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7737064","onlineDate":"07 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7737065,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Radmanesh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Sattari Aeronautical University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7737065/radma-2626152-small.gif","p":["Hamid Radmanesh was born in 1981.

Some modules were optimized in terms of FPGA resources used inside the chip. Meanwhile the ratio between the clock rate obtained for each component and the maximum frequency allowed by the FPGA was improved. We also introduce a multi-cycle pipeline implementation for SAD-based image matching, which facilitates a trade-off between chip area usage and operating speed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728979/7737101/07737151.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCP.2016.7737151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCP.2016.7737151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based stereo vision hardware for generating dense disparity maps","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Pipelines","Hardware","Image matching","Computer architecture","Aggregates","Stereo vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image matching","real-time systems","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","dense disparity map generation","stereo vision hardware","image matching","multicycle pipeline implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stereovision","image matching","FPGA","digital design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based stereo vision hardware for generating dense disparity maps","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737151/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16450419","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based stereo vision hardware for generating dense disparity maps","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"ICCP2016_225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05585S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728979","isNumber":"7737101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7728979","xplore-issue":"7737101","articleId":"7737151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737167,"authors":[{"name":"Mircea Paul Muresan","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Mircea Paul","lastName":"Muresan","id":"37085562830"},{"name":"Sergiu Nedevschi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Sergiu","lastName":"Nedevschi","id":"37283407700"},{"name":"Radu Danescu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Danescu","id":"37283406700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3899-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3898-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3900-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737167","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hamming distance","Cameras","Shape","Estimation","Transforms","Memory management","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image matching","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patch warping","local constraints","block matching stereo correspondence","depth estimation","stereoscopic camera","computer vision","slanted surfaces","fronto-parallel surfaces","binary masks","winning disparity generation","KITTI stereo benchmark dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stereo correspondence","block matching","3D reconstruction","local stereo"]}],"abstract":"Depth estimation of the surrounding environment using a stereoscopic camera setup is an important and fundamental research topic in computer vision. Due to its running time and quality performance in real situations the semi global matching algorithm is often used. The biggest disadvantage of the semi global approach is its large memory footprint. On the other hand, block matching stereo is leaner when it comes to memory consumption and therefore it is commonly used in applications where we do not have many resources, in order to obtain coarse depth information of the environment. The poor quality performance of such algorithms make them impractical for many real life applications. In this paper we focus on improving the quality of the classical block matching (BM) stereo method by proposing a novel approach which tackles the problem of stereo matching for slanted and fronto-parallel surfaces by using different types of binary masks on the matching window. Another improvement consists in the usage of different types of local constraints in the generation of the winning disparity for a specific position, such that possible outliers are eliminated from the start. The validation of our results has been done on the KITTI stereo benchmark dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICCP.2016.7737167","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728979/7737101/07737167.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCP.2016.7737167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737101","startPage":"321","endPage":"327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Patch warping and local constraints for improved block matching stereo correspondence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Patch warping and local constraints for improved block matching stereo correspondence","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737167/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16450425","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7737167/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Patch warping and local constraints for improved block matching stereo correspondence","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"ICCP2016_321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058735S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728979","isNumber":"7737101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7728979","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7737101","articleId":"7737167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737173,"authors":[{"name":"Vlad Ioan Nistorica","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Vlad Ioan","lastName":"Nistorica","id":"37085884629"},{"name":"Cristian Chilipirea","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Chilipirea","id":"38667160200"},{"name":"Ciprian Dobre","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Ciprian","lastName":"Dobre","id":"37322102100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3899-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3898-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3900-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737173","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"abstract":"Environmental scientists, city planners, park administrators, and similar others, need to base their decisions on up-to-date, accurate and high resolution measurement data. However, acquiring such data by hand or by deploying sensor networks is expensive and time consuming. People without proper scientific training want to take part in the scientific process and assist with the needs of their respective communities. Crowdsensing is a technology-driven area where ICT platforms are being developed which permit anyone to participate in processes that help expand our understanding and improve our surroundings. Crowdsensing refers to the process in which crowds (large number of people) measure specific features and share the resulting data or send it to a central location in which it can be used by the people that need it. There have been many crowdsensing applications. Since the increase in popularity of smartphones, which are now ubiquitous, crowdsensing is more popular than ever. Smartphones have all the basic requirements for the deployment of a crowdsensing application: a vast number of sensors, WiFi and LTE connectivity to transfer the data, and powerful, easy to program processors, as well as Bluetooth which permits the addition of specialized sensors. A lot of people can now participate to crowdsensing but we still don't know how many are needed for a crowdsensing campaign to be successful. In order to answer this question, we built a simulator that mimics the characteristics of a crowdsensing campaign. We showcase three different scenarios in which we estimate the required number of participants and offer a discussion on the plausibility of having that many participants by taking into account factors such as accessibility to the area of interest (the area from which the measurements are needed).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Smart phones","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Urban areas","Pollution measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart phones","social sciences computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowdsensing campaign","high resolution measurement data","scientific training","ICT platforms","smartphones","crowdsensing application","sensors","WiFi","LTE connectivity","data transfer","Bluetooth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crowdsensing","Smartphone","pedestrian density","incentives"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCP.2016.7737173","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728979/7737101/07737173.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCP.2016.7737173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How many people are needed for a crowdsensing campaign?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"How many people are needed for a crowdsensing campaign?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737173/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737173/","accessionNumber":"16450432","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How many people are needed for a crowdsensing campaign?","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"ICCP2016_353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059165S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728979","isNumber":"7737101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7728979","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7737101","articleId":"7737173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7737195,"authors":[{"name":"Wafa Werda","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Wafa","lastName":"Werda","id":"37085724918"},{"name":"Bo Gu","affiliation":["Global Information and Telecommunication Institute, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan","Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Gu","id":"38242725300"},{"name":"Kyoko Yamori","affiliation":["Global Information and Telecommunication Institute, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan","Department of Management Information, Asahi University, Mizuho-shi, Gifu, Japan"],"firstName":"Kyoko","lastName":"Yamori","id":"37085885752"},{"name":"Yoshiaki Tanaka","affiliation":["Global Information and Telecommunication Institute, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiaki","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37085415989"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-304-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9057-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737195","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Optimization","Economics","Heterogeneous networks","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","financial management","optimisation","pricing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pricing optimization strategy","revenue optimization strategy","macro-femto heterogeneous networks","mobile devices capabilities","wireless traffic demand","femtocell technology","wireless service provider"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["macrocell","femtocell","user's utility","pricing","revenue optimization"]}],"abstract":"The ongoing enhancement of mobile devices capabilities and advanced technologies has largely contributed to the huge increase of wireless traffic demand. Mobile network operators around the world are struggling to manage this new era of higher generation networks by finding new means and strategies to implement in order to meet the explosion in traffic demand. One of the current and most efficient strategies to handle this issue is the femtocell technology, which now has drawn the interest of main concerned actors as for manufacturers, operators, and researchers. In this paper, our main motivation was to address the macro-femto heterogeneous networks deployment issue from the economic side. Thus, we aimed to propose a pricing strategy for macro-femto networks with a user centric vision where users would have the choice to access one of the networks based on the proposed service price when he/she is accessing it. Based on our strategy, a wireless service provider's (WSP's) revenue optimization is then performed and evaluated in order to show the efficiency of our proposed pricing scheme.","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737195","publicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7689684/7737185/07737195.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pricing and revenue optimization strategy in macro-femto heterogeneous networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737195/","displayDocTitle":"Pricing and revenue optimization strategy in macro-femto heterogeneous networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16463570","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737195/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pricing and revenue optimization strategy in macro-femto heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"A_TS1-03_156416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099685S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7689684","isNumber":"7737185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7689684","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7737185","articleId":"7737195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737202,"authors":[{"name":"Hua-Jun Hong","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hua-Jun","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085358687"},{"name":"Pei-Hsuan Tsai","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Hsuan","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37085902089"},{"name":"Cheng-Hsin Hsu","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Cheng-Hsin","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37308458100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-304-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9057-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737202","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1406},"abstract":"Several applications, such as smart cities, smart homes and smart hospitals adopt Internet of Things (IoT) networks to collect data from IoT devices. The incredible growing speed of the number of IoT devices congests the networks and the large amount of data, which are streamed to data centers for further analysis, overload the data centers. In this paper, we implement a fog computing platform that leverages end devices, edge networks, and data centers to serve the IoT applications. In this paper, we focus on implementing a fog computing platform, which dynamically pushes programs to the devices. The programs pushed to the devices pre-process the data before transmitting them over the Internet, which reduces the network traffic and the load of data centers. We survey the existing platforms and virtualization technologies, and leverage them to implement the fog computing platform. Moreover, we formulate a deployment problem of the programs. We propose an efficient heuristic deployment algorithm to solve the problem. We also implement an optimal algorithm for comparisons. We conduct experiments with a real testbed to evaluate our algorithms and fog computing platform. The proposed algorithm shows near-optimal performance, which only deviates from optimal algorithm by at most 2% in terms of satisfied requests. Moreover, the proposed algorithm runs in real-time, and is scalable. More precisely, it computes 1000 requests with 500 devices in <; 2 seconds. Last, the implemented fog computing platform results in real-time deployment speed: it deploys 20 requests <; 10 seconds.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7689684/7737185/07737202.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic module deployment in a fog computing platform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Edge computing","Servers","Internet of Things","Containers","Cloud computing","Virtualization","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","Internet of Things","telecommunication traffic","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic module deployment","fog computing platform","Internet of Things networks","IoT networks","IoT devices","data centers","end devices","edge networks","IoT applications","network traffic reduction","Internet","virtualization technologies","program deployment problem","optimal algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic module deployment in a fog computing platform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737202/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16463659","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic module deployment in a fog computing platform","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"A_TS3-02_159703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058561S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7689684","isNumber":"7737185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7689684","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7737185","articleId":"7737202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737203,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Communications Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37061279100"},{"name":"Bo Gu","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Gu","id":"38242725300"},{"name":"Zhi Liu","affiliation":["Global Information and Telecommunication Institute, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085644371"},{"name":"Kyoko Yamori","affiliation":["Department of Management Information, Asahi University, Mizuho-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kyoko","lastName":"Yamori","id":"37294133900"},{"name":"Yoshiaki Tanaka","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiaki","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37270972500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-304-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9057-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737203","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":780},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Energy consumption","Mobile computing","Heuristic algorithms","Cellular networks","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["costing","dynamic programming","energy consumption","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","mobile radio","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement learning approach","cost-and energy-aware mobile data offloading","mobile network operators","wireless network capacity","WiFi hotspots","mobile traffic","network-centric methods","mobile users","MU","complementary WiFi network","WiFi offloading problem","traffic delay-tolerance","monetary cost","energy consumption","MU mobility pattern availability","finite-horizon discrete-time Markov decision process","FDTMDP","dynamic programming based offloading algorithm","reinforcement learning based offloading algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WiFi","mobile data offloading","reinforcement learning","energy-aware"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737203","abstract":"With rapid increases in demand for mobile data, mobile network operators are trying to expand wireless network capacity by deploying WiFi hotspots to offload their mobile traffic.

In this paper, we study the WiFi offloading problem from MU's perspective by considering delay-tolerance of traffic, monetary cost, energy consumption as well as the availability of MU's mobility pattern. We first formulate the WiFi offloading problem as a finite-horizon discrete-time Markov decision process (FDTMDP) with known MU's mobility pattern and propose a dynamic programming based offloading algorithm. Since MU's mobility pattern may not be known in advance, we then propose a reinforcement learning based offloading algorithm, which can work well with unknown MU's mobility pattern.

At last, comparing to basic heuristic algorithms, the proposed algorithm can perform better in term of throughput while satisfying the reliability of real time services.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PSO-based wireless network virtual mapping algorithm in smart grid","publicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737205","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7689684/7737185/07737205.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A PSO-based wireless network virtual mapping algorithm in smart grid","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737205/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16463581","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PSO-based wireless network virtual mapping algorithm in smart grid","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"A_TS4-01_157555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064295S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7689684","isNumber":"7737185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7689684","xplore-issue":"7737185","articleId":"7737205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737227,"authors":[{"name":"Pan Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Pan Zhang","id":"37087252340"},{"name":"Lanlan Rui","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lanlan Rui","id":"37087421889"},{"name":"Xuesong Qiu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xuesong Qiu","id":"37087195132"},{"name":"Ruichang Shi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ruichang Shi","id":"37088046354"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-304-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9057-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737227","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737227","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Data models","Real-time systems","Data integration","State estimation","Predictive models","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","regression analysis","sensor fusion","state estimation","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time urban traffic state estimation","multisource traffic data fusion","new fusion structure model","spatial fusion","temporal fusion","power average operator","temporal correlation based data compression","segment linear regression","TCDC algorithm","SLR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fusion structure model","real-time urban traffic state estimation","TCDC algorithm","power average operator"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737227","pdfPath":"/iel7/7689684/7737185/07737227.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new fusion structure model for real-time urban traffic state estimation by multisource traffic data fusion","abstract":"In order to meet the requirements of traffic data fusion for real-time urban traffic state estimation, a new kind of fusion structure model is proposed.

The interplay and cooperation between the edge (fog) and the core (cloud) has recently received considerable attention. In this paper, we consider task scheduling in a cloud-fog computing system, where a fog provider can exploit the collaboration between its own fog nodes and the rented cloud nodes for efficiently executing users' large-scale offloading applications. We first formulate the task scheduling problem in such cloud-fog environment and then propose a heuristic-based algorithm, whose major objective is achieving the balance between the makespan and the monetary cost of cloud resources. The numerical results show that our proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff value than other existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737240","publicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7689684/7737185/07737240.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards task scheduling in a cloud-fog computing system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737240/","displayDocTitle":"Towards task scheduling in a cloud-fog computing system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16463591","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737240/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards task scheduling in a cloud-fog computing system","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"B_P1-12_158858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037293S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7689684","isNumber":"7737185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7689684","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7737185","articleId":"7737240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737244,"authors":[{"name":"Ru-Yu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ru-Yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085890509"},{"name":"Yi-Ta Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ta","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37401811400"},{"name":"Chih-Wei Yi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Wei","lastName":"Yi","id":"37269745000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-304-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9057-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737244","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Vehicles","Safety","Standards","Vibrations","Servers","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","maintenance engineering","pattern classification","public transport","road safety","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowdsourcing-based road anomaly classification system","road networks","public transportation","pavement maintenance","safety related anomalies","speed bumps","rumble strips","dangerous anomalies","potholes","smart probe car crowds","SPC-crowd","anomaly data source","cloud servers","application services","underdamped oscillation model","UOM","supervised learning classification model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart probe car","crowdsourcing","data mining","support vector machine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737244","abstract":"Road networks are the most important facility to the public transportation in modern cities.

In this paper, we proposed a crowdsourcing solution to categorize road anomalies into safety related anomalies such as speed bumps and rumble strips, and dangerous anomalies such as bumps and potholes. The proposed system is composed of three parts: a smart probe car crowds (SPC-crowd) that serve as the anomaly data source; cloud servers that are the core for the anomaly classification; and application services that provide various innovative applications to facilitate the pavement maintenance. To support the crowdsourcing procedure, in the SPC-crowd side, we proposed cross-SPC techniques by adopting the underdamped oscillation model (UOM). In the cloud side, a supervised learning classification model was adopted on the anomaly data generated from the SPC-crowd. To validate the proposed system, extensive field trial was performed. The experimental results shown that our system can facilitate the pavement maintenance through the crowdsourcing solution.","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737244","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737185","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7689684/7737185/07737244.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A crowdsourcing-based road anomaly classification system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737244/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A crowdsourcing-based road anomaly classification system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737244/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16463575","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A crowdsourcing-based road anomaly classification system","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"B_P1-16_157322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057937S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7689684","isNumber":"7737185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7689684","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7737185","articleId":"7737244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7737247,"authors":[{"name":"Tai Manh Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea"],"lastName":"Tai Manh Ho","id":"37085348490"},{"name":"Nguyen H.

Furthermore, our problem imposes crucial constraints of both cross-tier interference for macrocell base station and quality of service for femtocell user. The joint problem is shown to be mix-integer nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard. To solve this problem efficiently, we employ a scheme consisting of two distributed algorithms.

The meritocracy of FPGAs depends on Fast real time Impulse Response (FIR) filtering algorithms and applications added in the rapid adoption and integration of FPGAs for Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) signal processing. The state of FPGA technologies underpin the migration from Large Scale Integration (VLSI) chips in radar signal processing to the reconfigurable technologies. Various FPGA devices and underlying technologies were investigated in this paper with a specialized bias on the ability to implement them on the underlying hardware with a broad base for flexibility and reconfiguration. The results show that parallel signal processing provides better signal processing compared with serial processing because of the flexibility in linear-systolic design placements, use of shift registers and real time memory retrieval capabilities, and use of two banks of coefficients to avoid using constant coefficients. However, there is need for further research on how to design chips with higher processing powers that can accommodate new versions of hardware and software.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility of mapping a pulsed RADAR system to FPGA-ASIC and hybrid architectures","doi":"10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737316","startPage":"85","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737292","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Innovative Business Practices for the Transformation of Societies (EmergiTech)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Innovative Business Practices for the Transformation of Societies (EmergiTech)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728913/7737292/07737316.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility of mapping a pulsed RADAR system to FPGA-ASIC and hybrid architectures","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737316/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16450355","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility of mapping a pulsed RADAR system to FPGA-ASIC and hybrid architectures","confLoc":"Balaclava, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"p85-aseeri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046087S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728913","isNumber":"7737292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7728913","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7737292","articleId":"7737316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737353,"authors":[{"name":"Likewin Thomas","affiliation":["Department of CSE, NITK, India"],"firstName":"Likewin","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37086227967"},{"name":"Manoj Kumar M V","affiliation":["Department of CSE, NITK, India"],"lastName":"Manoj Kumar M V","id":"37085901229"},{"name":"Annappa B","affiliation":["Department of CSE, NITK, India"],"lastName":"Annappa B","id":"37591245900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0706-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0707-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737353","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":760},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Mathematical model","Biological neural networks","Cost function","Brain modeling","Conferences","Business"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","gradient methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal neurons","hidden layers","feed-forward neural network","multi layered artificial neural network","self organizing neural network model","gradient decent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self-organizing neural network: cognitron","Feed-forward neural network","Neurons","Hidden layers","ADALINE","Gradient decent","Master-slave model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737353","abstract":"Identifying the number of neurons in each hidden layers and number of hidden layers in a multi layered Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a challenge based on the input data. A new hypothesis is proposed for organizing the synapse from x to y neuron. The synapse of number of neurons to fire between the hidden layer is identified. By the introduction of this hypothesis, an effective number of neurons in multilayered Artificial Neural Network can be identified and self organizing neural network model is developed which is referred as cognitron. The normal brain model has 3 layered perceptron; but the proposed model organizes the number of layers optimal for identifying an effective model. Our result proved that the proposed model constructs a neural model directly by identifying the optimal weights of each neurons and number of neurons in each dynamically identified hidden layers. This optimized model is self organized with different range of neurons on different layer of hidden layer, and by comparing the performance based on computational time and error at each iteration. An efficient number of neurons are organized using gradient decent. The proposed model thus train large model to perform the classification task by inserting optimal layers and neurons.","doi":"10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737353","startPage":"286","endPage":"291","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Innovative Business Practices for the Transformation of Societies (EmergiTech)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737292","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Innovative Business Practices for the Transformation of Societies (EmergiTech)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728913/7737292/07737353.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovery of optimal neurons and hidden layers in feed-forward Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737353/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Discovery of optimal neurons and hidden layers in feed-forward Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737353/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16450388","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovery of optimal neurons and hidden layers in feed-forward Neural Network","confLoc":"Balaclava, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"p286-thomas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098016S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728913","isNumber":"7737292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7728913","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7737292","articleId":"7737353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7737385,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Jingliang","affiliation":["School of Computer, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Jingliang","id":"37545482500"},{"name":"Ming Zhe","affiliation":["School of Computer, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhe","id":"37532191700"},{"name":"Su Jun","affiliation":["School of Computer, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Jun","id":"38245214200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1354-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1353-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1355-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737385","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer bugs","Classification algorithms","Correlation","Bayes methods","Support vector machines","Software","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","probability","program debugging","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven approach","latent Dirichlet allocation","LDA","duplicate bug identification","software development","software maintenance","software evolution","knowledge discovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["topic knowledge","classification","clustering","machine learning","bug report"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737385","abstract":"Marking duplicate bugs from bug report data has the significance to reduce effort and costs of software development, maintenance and evolution.

The considered arrhythmias include; right bundle branch block (RBBB), left bundle branch block (LBBB), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), and Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) which accompanied with normal signal are investigated. Two levels of feature extraction are totally used for arrhythmia recognition and after each level, the features are sent to neural network (NN) for classification. At first level of feature extraction, ECG signal is compressed using principal component analysis (PCA) which yields feature vectors. Then feature vector is sent to NN as the input. The results showed that this strategy could appropriately identify three species of arrhythmia with high accuracy but had remarkable errors in classifying SVT and RBBB. To overcome this failure, the linear features of heart rate variation plot (HRV) are extracted and used for training a second NN which acts as second classifier for SVT and RBBB. By applying this hybrid technique a precision of one hundred percent is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/IS.2016.7737390","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600987/7737379/07737390.pdf","startPage":"715","endPage":"722","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IS.2016.7737390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heart arrhythmias classification via a sequential classifier using neural network, principal component analysis and heart rate variation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Heart arrhythmias classification via a sequential classifier using neural network, principal component analysis and heart rate variation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16449011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7737390/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heart arrhythmias classification via a sequential classifier using neural network, principal component analysis and heart rate variation","confLoc":"Sofia, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"107_15z2PID4477815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066673S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600987","isNumber":"7737379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600987","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7737379","articleId":"7737390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737391,"authors":[{"name":"Nikodim Lazarov","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Nikodim","lastName":"Lazarov","id":"37085895565"},{"name":"Zlatoliliya Ilcheva","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Zlatoliliya","lastName":"Ilcheva","id":"37887710600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1354-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1353-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1355-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737391","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Cats","Chaotic communication","Integrated circuits","Forgery","Boats"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","feature extraction","image coding","image watermarking","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image watermarking algorithm","image tamper detection","chaotic map","data security","Arnold cat map","Tent map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fragile watermarking","tamper detection","chaotic maps","Arnold's cat map","Tent map"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737391","doi":"10.1109/IS.2016.7737391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IS.2016.7737391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737379","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600987/7737379/07737391.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fragile watermarking algorithm for image tamper detection based on chaotic maps","abstract":"Detection of tamper attempts on digital media is an important area in data security, providing valuable improvements over data integrity.

von neumann, John Atanasoff and ABC to Neuromorphic computation and the NeuCube spatio-temporal data machine","abstract":"During the 1940s John Atanasoff with the help of one of his students Clifford E. Berry, in Iowa State College, created the ABC (Atanasoff-Berry Computer) that was the first electronic digital computer. The ABC computer was not a general-purpose one, but still, it was the first to implement three of the most important ideas used in computers nowadays: binary data representation; using electronics instead of mechanical switches and wheels; using a Von Neumann architecture, where the memory and the computations are separated. A new computational paradigm, named as Neuromorphic, utilises the above two principles, but instead of the Von Neumann principle, it integrates the memory and the computation in a single module a spiking neural network (SNN) structure. The paper first reviews the need for neuromorphic systems and describes the principle differences from the traditional von Neumann architecture and then presents the NeuCube neuromorphic evolving spatio-temporal data machine for learning, recognising and understanding of spatio and spectro-temporal data using neuromorphic principles. This is the one of its kind artificial intelligence system that can be directly ported on the neuromorphic hardware chips. A limited version of the NeuCube software implementation is available from http://www.kedri.aut.ac.nz/neucube/.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737434/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16448910","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737434/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"From von neumann, John Atanasoff and ABC to Neuromorphic computation and the NeuCube spatio-temporal data machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From von neumann, John Atanasoff and ABC to Neuromorphic computation and the NeuCube spatio-temporal data machine","confLoc":"Sofia, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"3_196z2PID4397159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091425S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600987","isNumber":"7737379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600987","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7737379","articleId":"7737434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7737438,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Rubio-Solis","affiliation":["Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Rubio-Solis","id":"37085334554"},{"name":"George Panoutsos","affiliation":["Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Panoutsos","id":"37297289700"},{"name":"Steve Thornton","affiliation":["Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Thornton","id":"37886225100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1354-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1353-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1355-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737438","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rails","Steel","Data models","Pragmatics","Casting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","fuzzy neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","product quality","production engineering computing","radial basis function networks","rails","railway industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven fuzzy modelling framework","imbalanced data classification","DDFM framework","industrial-manufacturing data learning","machine learning methodology","rail quality","granular computing","RBF neural networks","radial basis function networks","GrC","RBF-NN","feature selection","FS","fast correlation-based filter","FCBF","iterative granulation concept","fuzzy constraints","neural fuzzy model","NFM","fuzzy set parameters","two-fold bootstrapping strategy","fuzzy linguistic rules","TATA Steel","UK","United Kingdom"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Granular Computing (GrC)","Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs)","Neural Fuzzy System (NFM)","RBF Neural Networks","Feature Selection (FS)","Imbalanced data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737438","abstract":"The design and implementation of Data-Driven Fuzzy Models (DDFMs) to learn balanced industrial/manufacturing data has demonstrated to be a popular machine learning methodology. However, DDFMs have also proven to perform poorly when it comes to learn from heavily imbalanced data. In this study we propose a DDFM to tackle the challenge of a two-class imbalanced case study for rail quality. We integrate a number of machine learning methods, namely: Granular Computing (GrC), RBF Neural Networks (RBF-NN), Feature Selection (FS) to create a DDFM framework which is sensitive to imbalanced data. The rationale behind the DDFM framework can be described into three main stages: in the first stage, a Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF) is employed to select the most representative features. Subsequently, the concept of iterative granulation is applied to group (cluster) the rail data set. Granulation provides a number of information granules which can be viewed as fuzzy constraints. In the second stage, an RBF-NN is used as a Neural Fuzzy Model (NFM) whose initial parameters are the parameters of the fuzzy sets created during the granulation process. Finally, a twofold bootstrapping strategy is performed. On the one hand, bootstrapping is used to balance the rate between the majority and minority class. On the other hand, bootstrapping estimates the appropriate number of fuzzy linguistic rules in the NFM. The proposed modelling framework is tested against a manufacturing case study provided by TATA Steel, UK.","doi":"10.1109/IS.2016.7737438","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600987/7737379/07737438.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"307","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IS.2016.7737438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-driven fuzzy modelling framework for the classification of imbalanced data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Data-driven fuzzy modelling framework for the classification of imbalanced data","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16448939","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7737438/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-driven fuzzy modelling framework for the classification of imbalanced data","confLoc":"Sofia, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"43_11z2PID4401739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088468S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600987","isNumber":"7737379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600987","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7737379","articleId":"7737438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7737446,"authors":[{"name":"Miroljub Mladenov","affiliation":["Dept. of Automatics and Mechatronics, University of Ruse, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Miroljub","lastName":"Mladenov","id":"38490825800"},{"name":"Martin Dejanov","affiliation":["Dept. of Automatics and Mechatronics, University of Ruse, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Dejanov","id":"37085906262"},{"name":"Stanislav Penchev","affiliation":["Dept. of Automatics and Mechatronics, University of Ruse, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Stanislav","lastName":"Penchev","id":"38468418100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1354-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1353-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1355-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737446","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dairy products","Predictive models","Neural networks","Network architecture","Hyperspectral imaging","Kernel","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","food products","hyperspectral imaging","neural nets","principal component analysis","product quality","regression analysis","spectrophotometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["food products freshness","neural networks","comparative analysis","white brined cheese","yellow cheese","meat","bacon","storage time","regression predictive models","product quality","quality features","feature extraction","spectrophotometer","frequency band","hyperspectral characteristics","principal components","separation accuracy","spectral data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dairy and meat products","freshness assessment","predictive models","neural networks","separation accuracy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737446","abstract":"The paper presents a comparative analysis of possibilities for assessment of the freshness of widespread foodstuffs like white brined cheese, yellow cheese, meat and bacon. The freshness is represented by the time of storage in specific conditions (dark room with temperature of 20\u00b0C). The time of storage is assessed using regression predictive models of features, related to the freshness product and through neural networks, which represent the product quality by set of features. The quality features are extracted from the spectral characteristics obtained from the overall measuring range of the spectrophotometer and from the selected frequency band of the hyperspectral characteristics. They are represented by the first three Principal Components. The possibility for distinct assessment of the time of storage is evaluated by the separation accuracy of the spectral data for different days of storage. It is found that the error of separation of spectral data decreases nearly two orders of magnitude when we use spectral data from selected frequency bands, instead of data obtained from the overall measuring range.","doi":"10.1109/IS.2016.7737446","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600987/7737379/07737446.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"369","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IS.2016.7737446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of the freshness of food products by predictive models and neural networks - a comparative analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the freshness of food products by predictive models and neural networks - a comparative analysis","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16448931","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7737446/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the freshness of food products by predictive models and neural networks - a comparative analysis","confLoc":"Sofia, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"50_24z2PID4477435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075702S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600987","isNumber":"7737379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600987","xplore-issue":"7737379","articleId":"7737446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737478,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Occlusion is dealt with separating shapes into parts through high curvature points, tangent angle signatures for each part and continuous wavelet transform for signatures. A hidden Markov model is created for each probable class in an ensemble trained with database objects from each class example. A strategy for search space sorting and stopping criterion are introduced to enhance retrieval performance of hypotheses from the database. The influence of sorting with proposed method is analysed to reduce recognition time on MPEG-7 and CMU KO datasets. Results showed the method not only was capable of identifying highly occluded shapes but also has relevant advantages over typical non-sorting approaches, reducing significantly the search for best hypotheses while keeping high recognition rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600987/7737379/07737478.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","doi":"10.1109/IS.2016.7737478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IS.2016.7737478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Search-space sorting with hidden Markov models for occluded object recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Hidden Markov models","Search problems","Sorting","Object recognition","Continuous wavelet transforms","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","image recognition","image retrieval","object recognition","search problems","visual databases","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["search space sorting","hidden Markov models","occluded object recognition","high curvature points","tangent angle signatures","continuous wavelet transform","criterion stopping","retrieval performance enhancement","recognition time reduction","MPEG-7 dataset","CMU KO dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Search Space Retrieval","Hidden Markov Models","Occluded Object Recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Search-space sorting with hidden Markov models for occluded object recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737478/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16448907","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Search-space sorting with hidden Markov models for occluded object recognition","confLoc":"Sofia, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"7_141z2PID4400915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064319S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600987","isNumber":"7737379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600987","xplore-issue":"7737379","articleId":"7737478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737484,"authors":[{"name":"Todor Petkov","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer science and technologies, University Prof. Asen Zlatarov, Burgas, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Todor","lastName":"Petkov","id":"37085832346"},{"name":"Evdokia Sotirova","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer science and technologies, University Prof. Asen Zlatarov, Burgas, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Evdokia","lastName":"Sotirova","id":"37267855400"},{"name":"Semran Ahmed","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer science and technologies, University Prof. Asen Zlatarov, Burgas, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Semran","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37085899300"},{"name":"Sotir Sotirov","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer science and technologies, University Prof. Asen Zlatarov, Burgas, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Sotir","lastName":"Sotirov","id":"37541716000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1354-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1353-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1355-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737484","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","cryptography","message authentication","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sound message encryption","self organizing map","SOM","artificial neural network","ANN","generalized net","random sound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["encryption","generalized net","neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737484","abstract":"This paper describes the process of encrypting message in a sound using artificial neural network.

Then a neotype parametric fault diagnosis approach for memristive networks is presented using the doublet generator, sensitivity method and fuzzy math method, which offers huge benefits in terms of accuracy and time consumption.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy-based parametric fault diagnosis approach for multiple memristor circuits","doi":"10.1109/CONTROL.2016.7737525","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONTROL.2016.7737525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737501","publicationTitle":"2016 UKACC 11th International Conference on Control (CONTROL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 UKACC 11th International Conference on Control (CONTROL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7602794/7737501/07737525.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy-based parametric fault diagnosis approach for multiple memristor circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737525/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449125","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy-based parametric fault diagnosis approach for multiple memristor circuits","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"CONTROL2016paper113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119468S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7602794","isNumber":"7737501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602794","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7737501","articleId":"7737525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737548,"authors":[{"name":"Teng D Chollom","affiliation":["Department of Engineeering, Air Force Research and Development Centre"],"firstName":"Teng D","lastName":"Chollom","id":"37085904776"},{"name":"Nkemdilim Ofodile","affiliation":["Department of Engineeering, Air Force Research and Development Centre"],"firstName":"Nkemdilim","lastName":"Ofodile","id":"37085579483"},{"name":"Osichinaka Ubadike","affiliation":["Air Force Research and Development Centre, Kaduna, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Osichinaka","lastName":"Ubadike","id":"37085526338"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9891-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9892-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737548","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737548","abstract":"A flight controller system is essential for any unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to efficiently execute a flight mission with or without disturbance.

The system is a five-layered network, which features coalescence between Takagi-Sugeno-kang fuzzy architecture and dissymmetrical Gaussian functions as membership functions. The partitioning made by the dissymmetrical Gaussian functions introduces the dissymmetry to the left and right widths of the input space to increase the flexibility of the design, thus resulting in a parsimonious fuzzy neural network with higher performance under online learning. We apply two criteria for rule generation, namely system error and \u03b5-completeness, reflecting both the performance and sample coverage of an existing rule base. During the parameters estimation phase, we adjust the Gaussian centers according to the adjustment of the widths. Parameters in the premise and the consequents are adjusted online based on the \u03b5-completeness of the fuzzy rules and Kalman Filter (KF) approach, respectively. The error reduction ratio (ERR) method is used as the pruning strategy.

Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal adaptive compensation control for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems with actuator failures","publicationTitle":"2016 UKACC 11th International Conference on Control (CONTROL)","doi":"10.1109/CONTROL.2016.7737628","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 UKACC 11th International Conference on Control (CONTROL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7602794/7737501/07737628.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONTROL.2016.7737628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal adaptive compensation control for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems with actuator failures","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737628/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449109","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal adaptive compensation control for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems with actuator failures","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"CONTROL2016paper65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092522S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7602794","isNumber":"7737501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602794","xplore-issue":"7737501","articleId":"7737628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737668,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Sielly Jales Costa","affiliation":["Campus Natal - Zona Norte, Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte - IFRN, Brazil"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Sielly Jales Costa","id":"37087705773"},{"name":"Clauber Gomes Bezerra","affiliation":["Campus EaD, Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte - IFRN, Natal, Brazil"],"firstName":"Clauber Gomes","lastName":"Bezerra","id":"38247187600"},{"name":"Luiz Affonso Guedes","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - UFRN"],"firstName":"Luiz Affonso","lastName":"Guedes","id":"37295062100"},{"name":"Plamen Parvanov Angelov","affiliation":["Chair of Excellence, Carlos III University, Madrid, Spain","School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Plamen Parvanov","lastName":"Angelov","id":"37271542300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0626-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0625-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0627-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737668","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Electronic mail","Training","Real-time systems","Mathematical model","Heuristic algorithms","Takagi-Sugeno model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","fault diagnosis","fuzzy set theory","knowledge based systems","pattern classification","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised data classification","data streams","eccentricity data analytics","online data classification","statistical analysis","self-evolving fuzzy-rule-basis","fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["classification","data streams","unsupervised","evolving systems","autonomous learning","real-time","TEDA","typicality","eccentricity","clustering","fuzzy classification","soft-labeling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to unsupervised and online data classification. The algorithm is based on the statistical analysis of selected features and development of a self-evolving fuzzy-rule-basis. It starts learning from an empty rule basis and, instead of offline training, it learns \u201con-the-fly\u201d. It is free of parameters and, thus, fuzzy rules, number, size or radius of the classes do not need to be pre-defined. It is very suitable for the classification of online data streams with real-time constraints. The past data do not need to be stored in memory, since that the algorithm is recursive, which makes it memory and computational power efficient. It is able to handle concept-drift and concept-evolution due to its evolving nature, which means that, not only rules/classes can be updated, but new classes can be created as new concepts emerge from the data. It can perform fuzzy classification/soft-labeling, which is preferred over traditional crisp classification in many areas of application. The algorithm was validated with an industrial pilot plant, where online calculated period and amplitude of control signal were used as input to a fault diagnosis application. The approach, however, is generic and can be applied to different problems and with much higher dimensional inputs. The results obtained from the real data are very significant.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised classification of data streams based on Typicality and Eccentricity Data Analytics","doi":"10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737668","startPage":"58","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737658","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7694773/7737658/07737668.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised classification of data streams based on Typicality and Eccentricity Data Analytics","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737668/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16450007","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised classification of data streams based on Typicality and Eccentricity Data Analytics","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-009-F-26058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062165S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7694773","isNumber":"7737658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7694773","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7737658","articleId":"7737668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737669,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Leite","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Federal University of Lavras, BRA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Leite","id":"37643932000"},{"name":"Marcio Santana","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Federal University of Lavras, BRA"],"firstName":"Marcio","lastName":"Santana","id":"37086188498"},{"name":"Ana Borges","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Federal University of Lavras, BRA"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Borges","id":"37086192094"},{"name":"Fernando Gomide","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Automation, University of Campinas, BRA"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Gomide","id":"37271287000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0626-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0625-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0627-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737669","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Fuzzy sets","Biological neural networks","Network topology","Data models","Uncertainty","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","fuzzy set theory","granular computing","neural nets","spatiotemporal phenomena","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy granular neural network","incremental modeling","nonlinear chaotic systems","intelligent systems","online data streams","Rossler chaos","evolving granular neural network","eGNN","fuzzy information granules","network topology","spatiotemporal features"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737669","abstract":"Evolving intelligent systems are useful for processing online data streams.

As a result, the insufficient bidirectional information interaction between exoskeleton and patient, the adaptive collaboration is very much absent. In the shared control situation at the interaction point, it is very important that the deficiency of impaired lower limb at knee joint dynamics (Capturing of the intended action of the patient) is extracted beforehand to estimate as to how much assistance need to be provided by the robotic exoskeleton. The intended action data that can be extracted from EMG signal may include the intended posture, intended torque, intended knee joint angle, intended knee joint torque and impedance parameter. In this paper, an application of Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) has been proposed to identify a proprioceptive feedback system which plays the role of inverse dynamics in the closed loop controlled Robotic Rehabilitation Device. The identified ANFIS inverse dynamic model updates the current status of the interaction force at the patient robotic exoskeleton interaction point.

The proposed model is able to estimate damping and demonstrate decent accuracy in modulating the knee joint dynamics to minimize the interaction force at the Patient Exoskeleton interaction point.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737776","startPage":"844","endPage":"849","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7694773/7737658/07737776.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System identification and damping coefficient estimation from EMG based on ANFIS to optimize human exoskeleton interaction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"System identification and damping coefficient estimation from EMG based on ANFIS to optimize human exoskeleton interaction","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737776/","accessionNumber":"16450264","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737776/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System identification and damping coefficient estimation from EMG based on ANFIS to optimize human exoskeleton interaction","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-117-F-16189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041508S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7694773","isNumber":"7737658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7694773","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7737658","articleId":"7737776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7737791,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Rubio-Solis","affiliation":["Automatic Control and Systems Engineering Department, The University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Rubio-Solis","id":"37085334554"},{"name":"George Panoutsos","affiliation":["Automatic Control and Systems Engineering Department, The University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Panoutsos","id":"37297289700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0626-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0625-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0627-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737791","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737791","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Iterative methods","MIMICs","Indexes","Neural networks","Prototypes","Cognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","granular computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novelty detection","complex datasets","granular compatibility measures","granular computing","granular density","granular volume","two-stage iterative information granulation","granular detectors","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative information granulation","granular detectors","compatibility criterion","information granules","novelty detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737791","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7694773/7737658/07737791.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative information granulation for novelty detection in complex datasets","abstract":"Recognition memory in a number of mammals is usually utilised to identify novel objects that violate model predictions. In humans in particular, the recognition of novel objects is foremost associated to their ability to group objects that are highly compatible/similar. Granular computing not only mimics the human cognition to draw objects together but also mimics the ability to capture associated properties by similarity, proximity or functionality. In this paper, an iterative information granulation approach is presented, for the problem of novelty detection in complex data. Two granular compatibility measures are used, based on principles of Granular Computing, namely the multidimensional distance between the granules, as well as the granular density and volume. A two-stage iterative information granulation is proposed in this work. In the first stage, a predefined number of granular detectors are constructed. The granular detectors capture the relationships (rules) between the input-output data and then use this information in a second granulation stage in order to discriminate new samples as novel. The proposed iterative information granulation approach for novelty detection is then applied to three different benchmark problems in pattern recognition demonstrating very good performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737791/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16450184","publicationDate":"July 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737791/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Iterative information granulation for novelty detection in complex datasets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative information granulation for novelty detection in complex datasets","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-132-F-16345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091129S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7694773","isNumber":"7737658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7694773","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7737658","articleId":"7737791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737792,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Many approaches have been proposed to generate membership functions from data, for example using fuzzy clustering or neural networks, but these generate abstract membership functions with no semantic meaning. Our approach uses word vectors that are extracted from large text corpora, so that semantically similar words have similar word vectors. We use projections of word vectors to (i) generate the peaks of membership functions over one-dimensional domains and use similarities between pairs of word vectors to (ii) compute selected membership values. We present four different alternatives to construct membership functions from (i) and (ii), which produce (a) singleton functions, (b) piecewise linear functions, (c) triangular functions, and (d) normalized triangular functions. In the experimental part we present examples from four different domains where our method successfully generates linguistically meaningful membership functions from word vectors of the 50-dimensional glove.6B.50d data set, and we also present an example that illustrates the limitations of the word vector based approach, when the considered linguistic terms come from different domains or contain ambiguity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737796/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737796/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16450192","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Generation of linguistic membership functions from word vectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of linguistic membership functions from word vectors","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-137-F-16023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076447S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7694773","isNumber":"7737658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7694773","xplore-issue":"7737658","articleId":"7737796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7737802,"authors":[{"name":"Raulc\u00e9zar M.

This task is composed by two phases. First, the robot must detect obstacles in the environment with its sensors. Then, it must choose an appropriate movement to go through the environment without colliding. However, the noise produced during the sensors reading can lead the robot to take wrong decisions. This paper presents the development of an E-Puck mobile robot obstacle avoidance controller using a Hybrid Intelligent System (HIS) based on Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The FL treats the data of infrared sensors and then feeds an ANN that decides which movement the robot must perform. The HIS was compared to another approach in which the data of infrared sensors are used directly in an ANN. The empirical results show that HIS avoids more collisions and improves the smoothness of navigation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737802/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16450270","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737802/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Obstacle avoidance for mobile robots: A Hybrid Intelligent System based on Fuzzy Logic and Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle avoidance for mobile robots: A Hybrid Intelligent System based on Fuzzy Logic and Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-143-F-16571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052524S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7694773","isNumber":"7737658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7694773","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7737658","articleId":"7737802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7737832,"authors":[{"name":"Tiefeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electric and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Tiefeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533183100"},{"name":"Mingdi Gu","affiliation":["School of Electric and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Mingdi","lastName":"Gu","id":"37085896926"},{"name":"Guangquan Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Guangquan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538429900"},{"name":"Jie Lu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Lu","id":"37536781400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0626-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0625-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0627-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737832","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"abstract":"This paper proposes a fast load pattern extraction approach to solve the time consuming problem in using a traditional k-means clustering method for large volumes of load curves.

Virtual machine (VM) migration is a technique that enables flexible resource allocation and increases the computation power and communication capability within cloud data centers. VM migration helps cloud providers to successfully achieve various resource management objectives such as load balancing, power management, fault tolerance, and system maintenance. However, the VM migration process can affect the performance of applications unless it is supported by smart optimization methods. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model to address this issue. The objectives are to minimize power consumption, maximize resource utilization (or minimize idle resources), and minimize VM transfer time. Fuzzy particle swarm optimization (PSO), which improves the efficiency of conventional PSO by using fuzzy logic systems, is relied upon to solve the optimization problem. The model is implemented in a cloud simulator to investigate its performance, and the results verify the performance improvement of the proposed model.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737833","pdfPath":"/iel7/7694773/7737658/07737833.pdf","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1265","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective optimization model for virtual machine mapping in cloud data centres","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective optimization model for virtual machine mapping in cloud data centres","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16450187","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7737833/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective optimization model for virtual machine mapping in cloud data centres","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-174-F-16381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060531S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7694773","isNumber":"7737658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7694773","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7737658","articleId":"7737833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7737868,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Ali Zoghlami","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Tunis El Manar, Ecole Nationale d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Tunis BP. 37, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed Ali","lastName":"Zoghlami","id":"37085608714"},{"name":"Minyar Sassi Hidri","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Tunis El Manar, Ecole Nationale d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Tunis BP. 37, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Minyar Sassi","lastName":"Hidri","id":"38251707400"},{"name":"Rahma Ben Ayed","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Tunis El Manar, Ecole Nationale d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Tunis BP. 37, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Rahma Ben","lastName":"Ayed","id":"38222269300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0626-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0625-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0627-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737868","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Big data","Algorithm design and analysis","Prototypes","Program processors","Handheld computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","fuzzy set theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling-based consensus fuzzy clustering","business processes","machine learning","Big Data clustering algorithms","parallel processing","partial data clustering","PDC","partial data access","split-and-merge fuzzy clustering","consensus clustering problem","optimization clustering","consensus computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Big Data","Fuzzy clustering","Consensus","Sampling","Parallel processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737868","doi":"10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737658","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7694773/7737658/07737868.pdf","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-based consensus fuzzy clustering on Big Data","abstract":"Many companies spend vast amounts of resources to collect, transform and store the massive amounts of data that flows through their business processes. When it comes to doing analysis and machine learning such as clustering on this data, time and compute speed gate determine how much data can be analyzed. Moreover, most Big Data clustering algorithms do not look at a complete, large dataset. Instead, they look at a subsample and work on approximations. However, work on samples can spread useful data that can be sources of value. In this paper, we use sampling combined with consensus strategy to dissemble the whole Big Data into small subsets, then basic partitions are locally generated from them using parallel processing. For the sampling part, we propose a partial data clustering (PDC) according to different nodes to classify the current sub-samples of partial data access (PDA) merged together with optimal prototypes generated from the last PDC and condensed into weighted points. For the consensus part, we apply a split-and-merge fuzzy clustering to equivalently transfer the consensus clustering problem into an optimization clustering one. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the ability to handle massive data and the consensus computing make the proposed classifier promising candidate for Big Data clustering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7737868/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16450075","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-based consensus fuzzy clustering on Big Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-based consensus fuzzy clustering on Big Data","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-209-F-16183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066009S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7694773","isNumber":"7737658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7694773","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7737658","articleId":"7737868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7737871,"authors":[{"name":"Elpiniki I.

The proposed structure optimization genetic algorithm (SOGA) for automatic construction of FCM is used for modeling complexity based on historical time series, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) which are used at the final process for making time series prediction. The suggested SOGA-FCM method is used for selecting the most important nodes (attributes) and interconnections among them which in the next stage are used as the input data to ANN used for time series prediction after training. The FCM with efficient learning algorithms and ANN have been already proved as sufficient methods for making time series forecasting. The performance of the proposed approach is presented through the analysis of real data of daily water demand and the corresponding prediction. The multivariate analysis of historical data is held for nine variables, season, month, day or week, holiday, mean and high temperature, rain average, touristic activity and water demand. The whole approach was implemented in an intelligent software tool initially deployed for FCM prediction. Through the experimental analysis, the usefulness of the new hybrid approach in water demand prediction is demonstrated, by calculating the mean absolute error (as one of the well known prediction measures). The results are promising for future work to this direction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid model for water demand prediction based on fuzzy cognitive maps and artificial neural networks","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","doi":"10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737871","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7694773/7737658/07737871.pdf","startPage":"1523","endPage":"1530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7737658","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7737871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7737871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid model for water demand prediction based on fuzzy cognitive maps and artificial neural networks","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7737871/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16450160","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid model for water demand prediction based on fuzzy cognitive maps and artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-212-F-16409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07142S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7694773","isNumber":"7737658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7694773","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7737658","articleId":"7737871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7737880,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Sakalli","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Sakalli","id":"37075908600"},{"name":"Aykut Beke","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Aykut","lastName":"Beke","id":"37085743925"},{"name":"Tufan Kumbasar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tufan","lastName":"Kumbasar","id":"37944959200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0626-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0625-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0627-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7737880","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulation","Kalman filters","Context","Uncertainty","Tuning","Steady-state","Fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","gradient methods","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters","robust control","self-adjusting systems","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-tuning structure","gradient descent method","extended Kalman filter estimation","EKF estimation","control performances","interval type-2 fuzzy PID controllers","footprint of the uncertainty parameters","GD based self-tuning IT2 FPID controller","EKF based STIT2- FPID controller structures","FOU design parameter","IT2 fuzzy sets","hybrid controller","type-1 FPID controller","GD-STIT2-FPID controller","EKF-STIT2-FPID controller","reference tracking","disturbance rejection performances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interval type-2 fuzzy PID controllers","Self-tuning controllers","Footprint of uncertainty"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we will present two novel self-tuning structure based on the Gradient Descent (GD) method and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) estimation to improve the control performances of Interval Type-2 (IT2) Fuzzy PID (FPID) controllers.

Moreover, the balance of the active power between the PV panel and the grid-connected inverter during grid faults is controlled by the dc-link bus voltage. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of over-current during LVRT operation, a current limit is predefined for the injection of reactive current.

Prediction of fatigue degrees is a crucial and arduous biomedical issue for driving safety, which has attracted growing attention of the research community in the recent past. Meanwhile, combined with the benefits of measuring EEG signals facilitates, many EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed for use in real-time mental assessment. In the literature, EEG signals are severely blended with stochastic noise; therefore, the performance of BCIs is constrained by low resolution in recognition tasks. For this rationale, independent component analysis (ICA) is usually used to find a source mapping from original data that has been blended with unrelated artificial noise. However, the mechanism of ICA cannot be used in real-time BCI design. To overcome this bottleneck, the proposed system in this paper utilizes a recurrent self-evolving fuzzy neural work (RSEFNN) to increase memory capability for adaptive noise cancellation when assessing drivers' mental states during a car driving task. The experimental results without the use of ICA procedure indicate that the proposed RSEFNN model remains superior performance compared with the state-of-the-arts

We propose a face recognition method based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a manifold-based track comparison strategy for low-resolution video face recognition. The low-resolution domain is addressed by adjusting the network architecture to prevent bottlenecks or significant upscaling of face images. The CNN is trained with a combination of a large-scale self-collected video face dataset and large-scale public image face datasets resulting in about 1.4M training images. To handle large amounts of video data and for effective comparison, the CNN face descriptors are compared efficiently on track level by local patch means. Our setup achieves 80.3 percent accuracy on a 32\u00d732 pixels low-resolution version of the YouTube Faces Database and outperforms local image descriptors as well as the state-of-the-art VGG-Face network [20] in this domain. The superior performance of the proposed method is confirmed on a self-collected in-the-wild surveillance dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449796","htmlLink":"/document/7738017/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-resolution Convolutional Neural Networks for video face recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-resolution Convolutional Neural Networks for video face recognition","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144762S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605056","isNumber":"7738014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605056","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7738014","articleId":"7738017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738054,"authors":[{"name":"Jong Hwan Ko","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jong Hwan","lastName":"Ko","id":"37085676198"},{"name":"Taesik Na","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Taesik","lastName":"Na","id":"37085794534"},{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saibal","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37278557500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3811-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3812-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738054","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738054","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Streaming media","Quantization (signal)","Discrete cosine transforms","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","energy conservation","field programmable gate arrays","video coding","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient wireless video sensor node","region-of-interest based multi-parameter rate controller","moving object surveillance","on-line multi-parameter rate controller","Motion JPEG","on-line rate controller","ROI-based coding","computation energy","CMOS","Virtex-V","FPGA","H.264/AVC","size 130 nm"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a lightweight video sensor node for moving object surveillance using region-of-interest (ROI) based coding and an on-line multi-parameter rate controller. The proposed ROI-based coding scheme determines ROI blocks, pre-processes non-ROI blocks using bit-truncation, and encodes all blocks using Motion JPEG. The on-line rate controller modulates the parameters of the ROI-based coding scheme to match the encoded data rate and transmission data rate under the variations in channel bandwidth and input video content. The low-complexity hardware of the ROI-based coding scheme reduces computation energy, and the on-line rate controller minimizes buffer requirement. The sensor node is designed in 130nm CMOS and prototyped in a Virtex-V FPGA.

However, this wild race towards even better performance in extreme conditions has overshadowed an important step i.e. the assessment of the impact of this new methodology on traditional issues on which for years the researchers had worked. This is particularly true for biometrics applications where the evaluation of deep learning has been made directly on newest large and more challencing datasets. This lead to a pure data driven evaluation that makes difficult to analyze the relationships between network configurations, learning process and experienced outcomes.

The spectral analysis suggests that the ego-noise consists of narrowband harmonic noise and broadband noise, whose spectra vary dynamically with the motor rotation speed. The spatial analysis suggests that the ego-noise of a P-rotor MAV can be modeled as P directional noises plus one diffuse noise. Moreover, because of the fixed positions of the microphones and motors, we can assume that the acoustic mixing network of the ego-noise is stationary. We validate the proposed noise model and the stationary mixing assumption by applying blind source separation to multi-channel recordings from both a static and a moving MAV and quantify the signal-to-noise ratio improvement.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a new dataset called GENDER-FERET with 474 training and 472 test samples and achieve an accuracy rate of 93.7%. It also outperforms an approach that relies on handcrafted features and an ensemble of classifiers. Furthermore, we perform another experiment by using the images of the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset to train our classifier and the test images of the GENDER-FERET dataset for evaluation. This experiment demonstrates the generalization ability of the proposed approach and it also outperforms two commercial libraries, namely Face++ and Luxand.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2016.7738068","publicationTitle":"2016 13th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605056/7738014/07738068.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"241","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2016.7738068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gender recognition from face images with trainable COSFIRE filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Gender recognition from face images with trainable COSFIRE filters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449781","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738068/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gender recognition from face images with trainable COSFIRE filters","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061338S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605056","isNumber":"7738014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605056","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7738014","articleId":"7738068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7738076,"authors":[{"name":"Fouad Bousetouane","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, USA"],"firstName":"Fouad","lastName":"Bousetouane","id":"37074586400"},{"name":"Brendan Morris","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, USA"],"firstName":"Brendan","lastName":"Morris","id":"37391430100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3811-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3812-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738076","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":598},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast CNN surveillance pipeline for fine-grained vessel classification and detection in maritime scenarios","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605056/7738014/07738076.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"248","publicationTitle":"2016 13th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2016.7738076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738014","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2016.7738076","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surveillance","Feature extraction","Pipelines","Proposals","Object detection","Detectors","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","neural nets","object detection","pipelines","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast CNN surveillance pipeline","fine-grained vessel classification","fine-grained vessel detection","maritime scenarios","deep convolutional neural networks","maritime video","GPU","fast-R-CNN","VGG16 network","feed-forward pass","support vector machine classifier","linear kernel","object verification","Annapolis maritime surveillance dataset"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738076","abstract":"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven very effective for many vision benchmarks in object detection and classification tasks.

The proposed pipeline is build upon the GPU implementation of Fast-R-CNN with three main steps:(1) Vessel filtering and regions proposal using low-cost weak object detectors based on hand-engineered features. (2) Deep CNN features of the candidates regions are computed with one feed-forward pass from the high-level layer of a fine-tuned VGG16 network. (3) Fine-grained classification is performed using CNN features and a support vector machine classifier with linear kernel for object verification. The performance of the proposed pipeline is compared with other popular CNN architectures with respect to detection accuracy and evaluation speed.

An equivalent two-port circuit is derived for the receiver noise figure. Compared to the actual LNAs, the equivalent IAA is shown to have the same noise-match admittance but generally larger minimum noise figure and coefficient of source mismatch. The increased parameters are shown to be Lange constants, invariant under lossless transformations at the inputs of the actual IAAs. The increase in the l.ange constants is found to be closely determined by the power in the orthogonal response of the array when excited by a source aligned with the vector of beamforming coefficients. The representation provides a basis for comparing the performance of various array designs with differential beamforming or other beamforming eonstraints.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2016.7738171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738091","startPage":"256","endPage":"259","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7604848/7738091/07738171.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalent two-port for receiver noise figure of connected array antennas with constrained beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738171/","displayDocTitle":"Equivalent two-port for receiver noise figure of connected array antennas with constrained beamforming","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449614","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent two-port for receiver noise figure of connected array antennas with constrained beamforming","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044825S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7604848","isNumber":"7738091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7604848","xplore-issue":"7738091","articleId":"7738171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7738182,"authors":[{"name":"M I Khalil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"M I","lastName":"Khalil","id":"37085511975"},{"name":"S M.

However, the lack of equivalent advancement in downlink technology has resulted in the development of an onboard data bottleneck. This bottleneck must be alleviated in order for EO satellites to continue to efficiently provide high quality and increasing quantities of payload data. This research explores the selection and implementation of state-of-the-art multidimensional image compression algorithms and proposes a new onboard data processing architecture, to help alleviate the bottleneck and increase the data throughput of the platform. The proposed new system is based upon a backplane architecture to provide scalability with different satellite platform sizes and varying mission's objectives. The heterogeneous nature of the architecture allows benefits of both Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) hardware to be leveraged for maximised data processing throughput.","doi":"10.1109/IST.2016.7738208","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7604853/7738183/07738208.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IST.2016.7738208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive multispectral GPU accelerated architecture for Earth Observation satellites","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738208","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xploreNote":"As originally published there was an error in this document.

A melanoma animal model was developed in order to monitor the process of melanoma development. Reference spectra were collected from normal skin areas, which were compared with the spectra obtained from the lesions using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm. A pseoudocolor map was created with different colors representing various degrees of similarity between test and reference spectra. The system's predictions ware validated with biopsy/histology. Both sensitivity and specificity were found to be 77%, highlighting the potential of the method to improve diagnostic and screening accuracies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral imaging and spectral classification for assisting in vivo diagnosis of melanoma precursors: preliminary results obtained from mice","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST)","doi":"10.1109/IST.2016.7738255","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7604853/7738183/07738255.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IST.2016.7738255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738255","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral imaging and spectral classification for assisting in vivo diagnosis of melanoma precursors: preliminary results obtained from mice","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738255/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449713","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral imaging and spectral classification for assisting in vivo diagnosis of melanoma precursors: preliminary results obtained from mice","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570288807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061199S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7604853","isNumber":"7738183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7604853","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7738183","articleId":"7738255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738329,"authors":[{"name":"Hongfeng Tao","affiliation":["Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Hongfeng","lastName":"Tao"},{"name":"Dapeng Chen","affiliation":["Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Dapeng","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Huizhong Yang","affiliation":["Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Huizhong","lastName":"Yang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-9266"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-9274"}],"articleNumber":"7738329","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738329","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Iterative algorithms","Fault detection","Actuators","Observers","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous systems","delays","fault diagnosis","iterative learning control","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative learning fault diagnosis algorithm","nonuniform output sampling hybrid system","integral mean value theorem","continuous systems","time-varying delay","output delay method","iterative learning regulation algorithm","electro-mechanical control system model"]}],"abstract":"For a class of non-uniform output sampling hybrid system with actuator faults and bounded disturbances, an iterative learning fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed.

Afterwards, an observer-based fault diagnosis filter with virtual fault is designed to estimate the equivalent fault, and the iterative learning regulation algorithm is chosen to update the virtual fault repeatedly to make it approximate the actual equivalent fault after some iterative learning trials, so the algorithm can detect and estimate the system faults adaptively.

An iterative prediction-update framework is adopted in the algorithm to simultaneously estimate the target state as well as the sensor state. At the prediction stage, a deterministic sampling approach is used to adjust the measurement covariance with sensor location uncertainty. Then a two-step grid-search technique is proposed to optimize the log-likelihood ratio, combined with a gradient-based search method. At the update stage, the operational sensor states are updated with target state estimates and measurements in corresponding validation gates. The updated sensor states are used to establish a more accurate log-likelihood ratio in the next iteration, which leads to better parameter estimation. In addition, the effects of the sensor location uncertainty on the track acceptance test and the posterior Cra\u1e3fer-Rao lower bound are also analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed method provides a computationally efficient way to improve track initialization performance in heavy clutter with sensor location uncertainty. The proposed work has applications in sonar tracking, geolocation, electronic support measures, and infrared search and tracking systems.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2016.140820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2016.140820","startPage":"1536","endPage":"1554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7738330/07738336.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive tracking in heavy clutter with sensor location uncertainty","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2016","displayDocTitle":"Passive tracking in heavy clutter with sensor location uncertainty","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","volume":"52","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738336/","accessionNumber":"16448336","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738336/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive tracking in heavy clutter with sensor location uncertainty","sourcePdf":"03-itae-52-4-1536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088277S","chronDate":"August  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7738330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7738330","articleId":"7738336","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7738341,"authors":[{"name":"Min Wu","affiliation":["Xidian University, National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7738330/7738341/7738341-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Min Wu was born in Hebei Province, China, 1988.

Target description and classification can be improved by incorporating pol-ISAR images. One of the most critical problems in ISAR imaging is accurate motion compensation, specifically for noncooperative targets. Due to the imperfection of coarse motion compensation, phase-adjustment methods are further developed to eliminate the residual phase errors. Unlike taking the contrast or entropy as the measurements in the existing pol-ISAR phase-adjustment algorithms, this paper exploits the sparsity of the scattering centers to correct the phase errors and simultaneously proposes an unambiguous image formation with the sparse aperture signal. The superiority of this algorithm is that the global information of full pol-ISAR images can be properly incorporated to compensate the phase errors and suppress the noise effectively. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7738330/07738341.pdf","startPage":"1592","endPage":"1606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2016.150078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2016.150078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase adjustment for polarimetric ISAR with compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Imaging","Scattering","Radar imaging","Signal resolution","Motion compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","radar imaging","radar polarimetry","radar signal processing","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase adjustment","polarimetric ISAR","compressive sensing","polarimetric inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging","noncooperative targets","sparse aperture signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Phase adjustment for polarimetric ISAR with compressive sensing","volume":"52","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7738341/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2016","accessionNumber":"16448316","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase adjustment for polarimetric ISAR with compressive sensing","sourcePdf":"08-itae-52-4-1592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104676S","chronDate":"August  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7738330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7738330","articleId":"7738341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738343,"authors":[{"name":"Eric B.

The contributions of this study are twofold. First, the OBA method is extended to be able to estimate the gyroscope biases coupled with the attitude based on the construction process of the existing OBA methods. This extension transforms the initial alignment into an attitude estimation problem that can be solved by using the nonlinear filtering algorithms. The second contribution is the comprehensive evaluation of the OBA methods and their extensions with different vector observations construction procedures in terms of convergence speed and steady-state estimate by using field test data collected from different grades of SINS. This study is expected to facilitate the selection of appropriate OBA methods for different grades of SINS.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2016.130824","startPage":"1697","endPage":"1713","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7738330/07738349.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2016.130824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization-based alignment for strapdown inertial navigation system: comparison and extension","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Position measurement","Navigation","Acceleration","Matrix decomposition","Mathematical model","Gyroscopes","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace instrumentation","filtering theory","gyroscopes","inertial navigation","nonlinear filters","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization-based alignment","strapdown inertial navigation system","OBA method","gyroscope","nonlinear filtering algorithms","steady-state estimate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimization-based alignment for strapdown inertial navigation system: comparison and extension","volume":"52","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7738349/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16448339","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization-based alignment for strapdown inertial navigation system: comparison and extension","sourcePdf":"16-itae-52-4-1697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067169S","chronDate":"August  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7738330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7738330","articleId":"7738349","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":7738357,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Kenneth McDonald","affiliation":["DRDC Ottawa, Radar Sensing and Exploitation, Ottawa, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7738330/7738357/7738357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael K.

In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization based waveform design framework is used to improve the features of radar pulses relying on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) structure. Our optimization techniques focus on finding optimal phase code sequences for the OFDM signal. Several optimality criteria are used since we consider two different radar processing solutions which call either for single- or multiple-objective optimizations (MOO). When minimization of the so-called peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) single-objective is tackled, we compare our findings with existing methods and emphasize on the merit of our approach. In the scope of the two-objective optimization, we first address PMEPR and peak-to-sidelobe level ratio (PSLR) and show that our approach based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) provides design solutions with noticeable improvements as opposed to random sets of phase codes. We then look at another case of interest where the objective functions are two measures of the sidelobe level, namely PSLR and the integrated-sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) and propose to modify the NSGA-II to include a constraint on the PMEPR instead. In the last part, we illustrate via a case study how our encoding solution makes it possible to minimize the single objective PMEPR while enabling a target detection enhancement strategy, when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric would be chosen for the detection framework.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2016.140671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7738330/07738365.pdf","startPage":"1953","endPage":"1966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2016.140671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of OFDM radar pulses using genetic algorithm based techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738365/","displayDocTitle":"Design of OFDM radar pulses using genetic algorithm based techniques","volume":"52","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 2016","accessionNumber":"16448342","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738365/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of OFDM radar pulses using genetic algorithm based techniques","sourcePdf":"32-itae-52-4-1953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100903S","chronDate":"August  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7738330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7738330","articleId":"7738365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738370,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume Ginolhac","affiliation":["LISTIC-Polytech Annecy-Chamb\u00e9ry, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Ginolhac","id":"37327308000"},{"name":"Philippe Forster","affiliation":["SATIE-ENS CACHAN, Cachan, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Forster","id":"38526056400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"7738370","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate distribution of the low-rank adaptive normalized matched filter test statistic under the null hypothesis","abstract":"In this paper, we propose to derive an approximate theoretical distribution under the null hypothesis of the low-rank adaptive normalized matched filter (LR-ANMF).

In the LR-ANMF, the estimated covariance matrix is replaced by the estimated orthogonal projector onto the subspace clutter. The method to derive this distribution is based on perturbation analysis and assumes a steering vector far from the clutter and a large clutter-to-noise ratio.

Therefore, in this paper, a fast cross-correlation mitigation algorithm based on the minimum mean-square error criterion is proposed. The algorithm exploits the matched filter outputs; hence, it is applicable to existing DSSS receivers based on direct pseudorandom noise code correlation. Essentially, the proposed scheme is an adaptive filter that optimizes each individual uncertain code phase delay. The algorithm employs both the code sequence information of the desired signal and that of the multiple-access interference signal, which enables it to outperform the standard matched filter, conventional least-mean-squares algorithm, and the pulse compression repair method. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm decreases the computational load compared with the existing multistatic adaptive pulse compression method by reducing the stage-number of the adaptive filter; this results in a slight degradation in performance. Numerical results verify the validity of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738374/","accessionNumber":"16448332","displayDocTitle":"Fast cross-correlation mitigation via minimum mean-square error estimation based on matched filter outputs for consecutive DSSS signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast cross-correlation mitigation via minimum mean-square error estimation based on matched filter outputs for consecutive DSSS signals","sourcePdf":"41-itae-52-4-2044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100023S","chronDate":"August  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7738330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7738330","articleId":"7738374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7738405,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-7084-110X","id":"37085769893"},{"name":"Youngnam Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngnam","lastName":"Han","id":"37280849300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7738405","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3007},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738405","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Resource management","Cellular networks","Three-dimensional displays","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Minimization","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","cellular radio","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous small cell","data-hungry devices","unmanned aerial vehicles","resource utilization","3D network architecture","resource allocation optimization mechanism","mean packet transmission delay","3D cellular network","multi-layer UAV","optimal spectrum allocation","power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Packet transmission delay","queueing theory","resources allocation","unmanned aerial vehicle","voronoi tessellation"]}],"abstract":"Research and development of heterogeneous small cell in cellular network accommodates the proliferation of data-hungry devices and applications. Meanwhile, for challenges in providing high-data-rate transmission in poor coverage area, utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides a promising solution attracting tremendous attention. However, tight integration of UAVs creates an obstruction in existing network to acquire high efficient resource utilization, which needs investigation in 3 D network architecture.

Numerical results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, where optimal spectrum and power allocation can provide minimum packet transmission delay.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2626293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2626293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7874222/07738405.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Packet Delay Minimization in Multi-Layer UAV Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Packet Delay Minimization in Multi-Layer UAV Networks","volume":"21","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738405/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16723222","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738405/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP)"},{"fundingName":"Korea government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"B0717-16-0004"},{"fundingName":"Analysis and Optimal Operation of 3-dimensional Mobile Networks for 5G Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Packet Delay Minimization in Multi-Layer UAV Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-han-2626293-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037135S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7874222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7874222","articleId":"7738405","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738407,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086143424"},{"name":"Bin Liao","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liao","orcid":"0000-0003-4636-4339","id":"37085676037"},{"name":"Lei Huang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0002-3838-1158","id":"37280051800"},{"name":"Chongtao Guo","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Chongtao","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085661878"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7738407","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":629},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738407","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Covariance matrices","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Symmetric matrices","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","interference (signal)","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind beamforming","multipath coherent signal reception","interference-to-signal ratio","composite steering vector estimation","CSV estimation","reduced covariance matrix","covariance matrix","eigendecomposition-based blind beamformer","minimum variance distortionless response beamformer","EBB weight vector","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind beamforming","multipath propagation","coherent signals","eigendecomposition"]}],"abstract":"This letter devises a new approach to blind beamforming for multipath coherent signal reception. It is shown that in the scenarios where the interferences are moderately stronger than the signal, namely, the interference-to-signal ratio is mildly high, the composite steering vector (CSV) of multipath coherent signals can be estimated via the eigendecomposition of a reduced covariance matrix, which subtracts the components of interferences and noise from the array covariance matrix. The proposed eigendecomposition-based blind beamformer (EBB) is thereby obtained by substituting the estimate of CSV into the minimum variance distortionless response beamformer. It is also shown that the proposed EBB weight vector is actually equal to the principal eigenvector of the reduced covariance matrix. The performance of the proposed EBB is demonstrated by numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2626365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2626365","startPage":"322","endPage":"325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07738407.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Eigendecomposition-Based Approach to Blind Beamforming in a Multipath Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"An Eigendecomposition-Based Approach to Blind Beamforming in a Multipath Environment","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668381","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7738407/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401284 and 61601307"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20140418091413566 and JCYJ20160422102022017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Eigendecomposition-Based Approach to Blind Beamforming in a Multipath Environment","sourcePdf":"lcomm-liao-2626365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059341S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7738407","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738408,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7738408/xu-2621010-small.gif","p":["Chen Xu (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2010 and the Ph.D. degree from Peking University in 2015.

Device-to-device (D2D) communication, as a promising solution to overcome wireless spectrum crisis, can enable fast content delivery based on user activities in social networks. In this paper, we address the content delivery problem related to optimization of peer discovery and resource allocation by combining both the social and physical layer information in D2D underlay networks. The social relationship, which is modeled as the probability of selecting similar contents and estimated by using the Bayesian nonparametric models, is used as a weight to characterize the impact of social features on D2D pair formation and content sharing. Next, we propose a 3-D iterative matching algorithm to maximize the sum rate of D2D pairs weighted by the intensity of social relationships while guaranteeing the quality of service requirements of both cellular and D2D links simultaneously. Moreover, we prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stable matching and is weak Pareto optimal, and also provide the theoretical complexity. Simulation results show that the algorithm is able to achieve more than 90% of the optimum performance with a computation complexity 1000 times lower than the exhaustive matching algorithm. It is also demonstrated that the satisfaction performance of D2D receivers can be increased significantly by incorporating social relationships into the resource allocation design.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07738408.pdf","startPage":"924","endPage":"937","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social Network-Based Content Delivery in Device-to-Device Underlay Cellular Networks Using Matching Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","Resource management","Receivers","Cellular networks","Transmitters","Quality of service","Social network services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","data communication","quality of service","resource allocation","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social network-based content delivery","device-to-device underlay cellular networks","matching theory","mobile data traffic","device-to-device communication","wireless spectrum crisis","D2D links","computation complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Social network","device-to-device communication","content delivery","Bayesian nonparametric models","matching theory"]}],"topic":"Recent Advances in Socially-aware Mobile Networking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Social Network-Based Content Delivery in Device-to-Device Underlay Cellular Networks Using Matching Theory","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7738408/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16720308","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601180 and 61601181"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014MS08 and 2016MS17"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2015AA01A706"},{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"284748 and 297642"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Social Network-Based Content Delivery in Device-to-Device Underlay Cellular Networks Using Matching Theory","sourcePdf":"access-chang-2621010-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118336S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Recent Advances in Socially-aware Mobile Networking"],"articleId":"7738408","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738409,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Network, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7738409/liu-2626369-small.gif","p":["Wei Liu (SM\u201914) received the B.S. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 1999, the M.S. degree from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Southampton, U.K., in 2007.

At first, a novel spectrum-aware clustering mechanism is introduced. The proposed clustering mechanism divides node into clusters based on three values: spectrum availability, power level of node, and node stability. Therefore, clusters are formed with the highest stability to avoid frequent reclustering. Later, a routing algorithm is introduced to minimize the delay while achieving acceptable delivery ratio. In this paper, routing is defined as a multi-objective optimization problem to combine different individual routing metrics to form a global metric. Simulation results show that our proposed routing algorithm can guarantee a lower delay and a higher packet delivery ratio than conventional routing protocols for cognitive radio ad hoc networks. Due to our routing design specification, such as power consideration and low delay, it can be suitable to be adopted for Internet of Things applications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2626721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","startPage":"8294","endPage":"8302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07738411.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Demand Hybrid Routing for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Network","topic":"Future Networks: Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738411/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On-Demand Hybrid Routing for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Network","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16568328","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of Malaya under UMRG","grantNumber":"RG325-15AFR"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002383","fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this Prolific Research Group","grantNumber":"PRG-1436-16"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On-Demand Hybrid Routing for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Network","sourcePdf":"access-anisi-2626721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081936S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Future Networks: Architectures"],"articleId":"7738411","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":7738414,"authors":[{"name":"Min Tan","affiliation":["School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","The Kong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7845730/7738414/tan-2611513-small.gif","p":["Min Tan (S\u201912\u2013M\u201916) received the B.E. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2005, the M.Phil. degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2015.","From 2008 to 2011, he was a Circuit Design Engineer with the Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Chongqing, China.

By sensing the ripple current, a ripple current sensor (RCS) is able to overcome the bandwidth limitation of an absolute current sensor. By leveraging the RCS, we propose a large-signal PWM control method for HSMs. This method has an intrinsically fast switching loop, and thus eliminates the need for the feed-forward path used in many previous designs. The possibility of generating high-order harmonics in PWM-controlled HSMs is pointed out for the first time, and design recommendations to avoid them are presented. A very-high-frequency triangular wave generator that is robust to both process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations and device mismatches is proposed. A proof-of-concept prototype was fabricated in CMOS 130 nm technology. Switching at 100 MHz, this HSM is able to track a 0.8 V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pp</sub>\n sinusoidal waveform up to 13 MHz with high fidelity.

Motivated by the observation that Wi-Fi signals in a 2.4 GHz ISM band can be sensed by a WPAN radio over the frequency range of the corresponding Wi-Fi channel, Width- Sense exploits the temporally correlated fluctuations in multiple narrowband WPAN-channels.

Power quality is an important aspect of renewable energy integration. The major power quality concerns are: 1) Voltage and frequency fluctuations, which are caused by noncontrollable variability of renewable energy resources. The intermittent nature of renewable energy resources due to ever-changing weather conditions leads to voltage and frequency fluctuations at the interconnected power grid. 2) Harmonics, which are introduced by power electronic devices utilized in renewable energy generation. When penetration level of renewable energy is high, the influence of harmonics could be significant. In this paper, an extensive literature review is conducted on emerging power quality challenges due to renewable energy integration. This paper consists of two sections: 1) Power quality problem definition. Wind turbines and solar photovoltaic systems and their power quality issues are summarized. 2) Existing approaches to improve power quality. Various methods are reviewed, and the control-technology-based power quality improvement is the major focus of this paper. The future research directions for emerging power quality challenges for renewable energy integration are recommended.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2017","volume":"53","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16756525","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2017","publicationDate":"March-April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7738432/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Emerging Power Quality Challenges Due to Integration of Renewable Energy Sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emerging Power Quality Challenges Due to Integration of Renewable Energy Sources","sourcePdf":"tia-liang-2626253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118818S","chronDate":"March-April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7880726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"330","xplore-issue":"7880726","articleId":"7738432","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7738433,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew N.

This paper builds on a previous effort by the authors, in which an empirical performance evaluation was performed using a reduced-scale variant of the medium-voltage direct current (MVDC)-rated SiC MOSFET module. In this paper, full-scale module samples are used, which are capable of continuous operation at 120 A. Thus, the evaluation provided here offers improved relevance to the category of full-scale MVDC applications of which future naval shipboard power systems are expected to be a part. The evaluation effort described here considers both the static and dynamic performances of the considered 10-kV SiC MOSFET module, along with the identification of integration considerations that will be of use to designers of future applications based on this technology. Specific contributions of this paper that belong to this category include the presentation of a custom gate-drive circuit designed to operate the modules under consideration and the presentation of a detailed behavioral simulation model created to predict the performance of the same. The output of this model is compared with experimental waveforms captured during pulsed switching experiments at a bus voltage of 2 kV and a load current of 100 A. The simulation output is demonstrated to offer good agreement with the experimental waveforms during both turn-on and turn-off transitions. The availability of such a model is important because it makes possible the execution of a wide range of feasibility and trade studies for future applications by researchers without physical access to this technology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization and Modeling of 10-kV Silicon Carbide Modules for Naval Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2016.2626305","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/7837735/07738433.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2016.2626305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7837735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738433/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Characterization and Modeling of 10-kV Silicon Carbide Modules for Naval Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7738433/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16638926","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization and Modeling of 10-kV Silicon Carbide Modules for Naval Applications","sourcePdf":"jestpe-lemmon-2626305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079722S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"7837735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7837735","articleId":"7738433","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738440,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Fan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Microelectronics and Solid-State Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Fan","orcid":"0000-0002-5521-6082","id":"37085521672"},{"name":"Franco Maloberti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Maloberti","id":"37269864600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7738440","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3610},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Redundancy","Linearity","Signal to noise ratio","Calibration","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","mean square error methods","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-resolution SAR ADC","digital-to-analog converter switching techniques","binary-weighted capacitor array","successive approximation register","analog-to-digital converter","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","spurious free dynamic range","SFDR","static linearity improvement","Monte Carlo runs","redundancy scheme","root-mean-square","integral nonlinearity","word length 14 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","capacitive digital-to-analog converter (DAC)","differential nonlinearity (DNL)","integral nonlinearity (INL)","successive approximation register (SAR) ADC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738440","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8048686/07738440.pdf","startPage":"1142","endPage":"1146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2626300","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2626300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Resolution SAR ADC With Enhanced Linearity","abstract":"This brief proposes two digital-to-analog converter switching techniques for binary-weighted capacitor array successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC), rotating&averaging without redundancy technique and rotating&averaging with redundancy technique. The rotating&averaging without redundancy technique can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of conventional SAR ADCs by averaging four samples for one input voltage, while the rotating&averaging with redundancy has better static linearity improvement but less SNR improvement than the rotating&averaging without redundancy technique. The application of these two methods to 14-bit SAR ADC is demonstrated by Monte-Carlo runs, results show that with a mismatch error typical of modern technology, the proposed rotating&averaging with redundancy scheme can improve the root-mean-square of integral nonlinearity from 2.08 to 0.57 LSB, and the SFDR is more than 15 dB better. On the other hand, the averaged SNR of 7.7 dB is improved by using the proposed rotating&averaging without redundancy technique for a 14-bit SAR ADC. Furthermore, the schemes proposed require only small additional circuit on a typical SAR ADC configuration, which are more feasible to implement high-resolution SAR ADC compared with the traditional calibration schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738440/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"17205536","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7738440/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Resolution SAR ADC With Enhanced Linearity","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401066"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2014J029"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Resolution SAR ADC With Enhanced Linearity","sourcePdf":"tcsii-fan-2626300-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055831S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8048686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8048686","articleId":"7738440","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738441,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Healthcare big data comprise data from different structured, semi-structured, and unstructured sources. These data sources vary in terms of heterogeneity, volume, variety, velocity, and value that traditional frameworks, algorithms, tools, and techniques are not fully capable of handling. Therefore, a framework is required that facilitates collection, extraction, storage, classification, processing, and modeling of this vast heterogeneous volume of data. This paper proposes a healthcare big data framework using voice pathology assessment (VPA) as a case study. In the proposed VPA system, two robust features, MPEG-7 low-level audio and the interlaced derivative pattern, are used for processing the voice or speech signals. The machine learning algorithms in the form of a support vector machine, an extreme learning machine, and a Gaussian mixture model are used as the classifier. In the experiments, the proposed VPA system shows its efficiency in terms of accuracy and time requirement.","topic":"Healthcare Big Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738441/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","volume":"4","accessionNumber":"16509362","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738441/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Healthcare Big Data Voice Pathology Assessment Framework","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002383","fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through the Research Group Project","grantNumber":"RGP-228"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Healthcare Big Data Voice Pathology Assessment Framework","sourcePdf":"access-hossain-2626316-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065442S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Healthcare Big Data"],"articleId":"7738441","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738444,"authors":[{"name":"Long D.

The first objective is to design cooperative transmit beamformers at the base stations to maximize the network energy efficiency (EE) in terms of bits per joule subject to the users' quality of service (QoS) constraints, which poses a computationally difficult optimization problem. The commonly used Dinkelbach-type algorithms for optimizing a ratio of concave and convex functions are not applicable. This paper develops a path-following algorithm to address the computational solution to this problem, which invokes only a simple convex quadratic program of moderate dimension at each iteration and quickly converges at least to a locally optimal solution. Furthermore, the problem of joint beamformer design and SBS service assignment in the three-objective (EE, QoS, and service loading) optimization is also addressed. Numerical results demonstrate the performance advantage of the proposed solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07738444.pdf","startPage":"7958","endPage":"7966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2626363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2626363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Signalling in QoS Constrained Heterogeneous Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Throughput","Base stations","Optimization","Power demand","Heterogeneous networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","concave programming","convex programming","cooperative communication","energy conservation","quality of service","telecommunication power management","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS constrained heterogeneous network","energy-efficient signalling","small cell base station","SBS","macrobase station","multiple user terminal","cooperative transmit beamformer design","quality of service constraint","Dinkelbach-type algorithm","concave function","convex function","path-following algorithm","convex quadratic program","joint beamformer design problem","SBS service assignment problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous networks","energy efficiency","QoS constraint","service loading","fractional programming","path-following method"]}],"topic":"Deployment and Management of Small Heterogeneous Cells for 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Signalling in QoS Constrained Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7738444/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16509370","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415n14n22"},{"fundingName":"Newton Institutional Link","grantNumber":"172719890"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy-Efficient Signalling in QoS Constrained Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"access-duong-2626363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145102S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Deployment and Management of Small Heterogeneous Cells for 5G"],"articleId":"7738444","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738447,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Li","affiliation":["Philips Lighting Research, Eindhoven, AE, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["Shuai Li, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Li","id":"37075705200"},{"name":"Ashish Pandharipande","affiliation":["Philips Lighting Research, Eindhoven, AE, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["Ashish Pandharipande, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Pandharipande","orcid":"0000-0002-7920-3964","id":"37266388400"},{"name":"Frans M.

The criterion is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system. We adopt the time-sharing concept to allocate each subcarrier to one user, which results in a criterion similar with that of rate maximization. However, this approach does not make it possible to solve the problem for any value of the transmit power. We found that there exist gaps along the direction of total transmit power when the user selection switches for each subcarrier, which leads to a discontinuous EE function, for which quasi-concavity has to be checked. We first show that the sufficient conditions obtained for the subcarrier allocation approach are the optimal ones among all possibilities with the same transmit power. Then, we show that the proposed subcarrier allocation results in a discontinuous and quasi-concave EE function. We also give an upper bound of the EE function when the proposed sufficient conditions are not met. Finally, we propose an algorithm to find the maximal EE and its performance is illustrated by means of numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2626370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2626370","startPage":"136","endPage":"146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07738448.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier Allocation and Precoder Design for Energy Efficient MIMO-OFDMA Downlink Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier Allocation and Precoder Design for Energy Efficient MIMO-OFDMA Downlink Systems","volume":"65","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598316","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7738448/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"BELSPO","grantNumber":"IAP Project Bestcom"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier Allocation and Precoder Design for Energy Efficient MIMO-OFDMA Downlink Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-2626370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105063S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7738448","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738452,"authors":[{"name":"Taehyeun Park","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7738452/park-2615643-small.gif","p":["Taehyeun Park received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from The Cooper Union in 2015.

One of the most promising solutions to address these challenges is via the use of innovative learning frameworks that will enable the IoT devices to operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. However, developing learning mechanisms for the IoT requires coping with unique IoT properties in terms of resource constraints, heterogeneity, and strict quality-of-service requirements. In this paper, a number of emerging learning frameworks suitable for IoT applications are presented. In particular, the advantages, limitations, IoT applications, and key results pertaining to machine learning, sequential learning, and reinforcement learning are studied. For each type of learning, the computational complexity, required information, and learning performance are discussed. Then, to handle the heterogeneity of the IoT, a new framework based on the powerful tools of cognitive hierarchy theory is introduced. This framework is shown to efficiently capture the different IoT device types and varying levels of available resources among the IoT devices. In particular, the different resource capabilities of IoT devices are mapped to different levels of rationality in cognitive hierarchy theory, thus enabling the IoT devices to use different learning frameworks depending on their available resources. Finally, key results on the use of cognitive hierarchy theory in the IoT are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2615643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2615643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07738452.pdf","startPage":"7063","endPage":"7073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning How to Communicate in the Internet of Things: Finite Resources and Heterogeneity","topic":"Optimization for Emerging Wireless Networks: IoT, 5G and Smart Grid Communication Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Learning How to Communicate in the Internet of Things: Finite Resources and Heterogeneity","volume":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738452/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16470585","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738452/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"U.S. Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-15-1-2709"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ACI-1541105"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Learning How to Communicate in the Internet of Things: Finite Resources and Heterogeneity","sourcePdf":"access-park-2615643-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130712S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Optimization for Emerging Wireless Networks: IoT, 5G and Smart Grid Communication Networks"],"articleId":"7738452","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":7738453,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeong Soo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7818052/7738453/kim-2626281-small.gif","p":["Kyeong Soo Kim (S\u201989\u2013M\u201997) received the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, in 1995.

It is this asymmetry that our study focuses on; unlike most existing schemes to save the power of all network nodes, we concentrate on battery-powered sensor nodes in minimizing energy consumption for time synchronization. We present a time synchronization scheme based on asynchronous source clock frequency recovery and reverse two-way message exchanges combined with measurement data report messages, where we minimize the number of message transmissions from sensor nodes while achieving sub-microsecond time synchronization accuracy through propagation delay compensation. We carry out the performance analysis of the estimation of both measurement time and clock frequency with lower bounds for the latter. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperforms the schemes based on conventional two-way message exchanges with and without clock frequency recovery in terms of the accuracy of measurement time estimation and the number of message transmissions and receptions at sensor nodes as an indirect measure of energy efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"65","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16598315","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7738453/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Time Synchronization Based on Asynchronous Source Clock Frequency Recovery and Reverse Two-Way Message Exchanges in Wireless Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University Centre for Smart Grid and Information Convergence (CeSGIC) and Research Development Fund","grantNumber":"RDF-14-01-25"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Time Synchronization Based on Asynchronous Source Clock Frequency Recovery and Reverse Two-Way Message Exchanges in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-kim-2626281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111652S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7738453","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738455,"authors":[{"name":"Huizhen Jenny Qian","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Circuits, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Huizhen Jenny","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085399336"},{"name":"Xun Luo","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Circuits, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Luo","orcid":"0000-0002-1318-9418","id":"37085394858"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7738455","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1257},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance matching","System-on-chip","Wideband","Insertion loss","Silicon germanium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baluns","Ge-Si alloys"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact on-chip balun","enhanced inband balance response","SSC Marchand balun","stacked-spiral coupled Marchand balun","fractional bandwidth","FBW","amplitude balance","phase balance","self-coupled compensation line","center-tapped groundshield","frequency 6.5 GHz to 28.5 GHz","size 0.13 mum","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Balun","deep-trench","self-coupled compensation line","stacked-spiral-coupled (SSC)","wideband"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact 6.5-28.5 GHz On-Chip Balun With Enhanced Inband Balance Responses","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2016.2623255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7745813","endPage":"995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/7745813/07738455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2016.2623255","startPage":"993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738455","abstract":"In this letter, a miniaturized on-chip stacked-spiral-coupled (SSC) Marchand balun is proposed with wideband operation, i.e., fractional bandwidth (FBW) >125%.

It has been widely studied in a generational evolution model, where the environmental selection is performed after generating a whole population of offspring. However, in a steady-state evolution model, where a population is updated right after the generation of a new candidate, the NDS can be extremely time consuming. This is especially severe when the number of objectives and population size become large. In this paper, we propose an efficient NDL update method to reduce the cost for maintaining the NDL structure in steady-state EMO. Instead of performing the NDS from scratch, our method only updates the NDLs of a limited number of solutions by extracting the knowledge from the current NDL structure. Notice that our NDL update method is performed twice at each iteration. One is after the reproduction, the other is after the environmental selection. Extensive experiments fully demonstrate that, comparing to the other five state-of-the-art NDS methods, our proposed method avoids a significant amount of unnecessary comparisons, not only in the synthetic data sets, but also in some real optimization scenarios. Last but not least, we find that our proposed method is also useful for the generational evolution model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738460/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17081457","pubMedId":"27845681","htmlLink":"/document/7738460/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","volume":"47","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Nondomination Level Update Method for Steady-State Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473241"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Nondomination Level Update Method for Steady-State Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcyb-li-2621008-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093631S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8006322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8006322","articleId":"7738460","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738461,"authors":[{"name":"Ata Zadehgol","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Ata","lastName":"Zadehgol","orcid":"0000-0002-1111-704X","id":"37704058500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7738461","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":482},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Computational modeling","Conductivity","Magnetic domains","Antennas","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","computational electromagnetics","electric admittance","electrical conductivity","finite difference time-domain analysis","reduced order systems","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impedance transfer function formulation","reduced-order macromodels","subgridded regions","FDTD","model order reduction","admittance transfer function formulation","electric conductivity","magnetic conductivity","computational electromagnetics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","macromodel","subgridding"]}],"abstract":"Recently, model order reduction was applied to the macromodel of a subgridded region in the method of finite-difference time domain (FDTD), where an admittance transfer function formulation was used to model materials with electric conductivity.

Investigation of the near-field heat transfer is essential to optimize the head disk interface. An equivalent simulation model of the head disk interface for studying the radiative heat transfer is provided in this paper. Both the head shape and the magnetic properties of material are considered in this paper. The dyadic Green's functions along with fluctuational electrodynamics as well as scatter matrix are employed to calculate the heat transfer at the head disk interface. The head is simplified as a nanosphere, while the disk is simplified as a semi-infinite multilayered structures, in which the thickness of all layers is in nanoscale. The results show that the near-field radiative heat transfer between the head and disk in HAMR can exceed the values predicted by the Planck blackbody calculation by a few orders of magnitude. The total power is found to exponentially increase when the distance between the head and disk decreases.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2016.2626390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7857828/07738469.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2016.2626390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7857828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer of Multilayered Structures in Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738469/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer of Multilayered Structures in Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording","volume":"53","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16690001","externalId":"3301106","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738469/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Self Planned Task of State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System HIT","grantNumber":"NO.

The antenna design procedure is outlined and a prototype for WiFi applications was fabricated and measured for impedance matching, radiation pattern, and broadside gain. A simulated parametric analysis was performed on the interdigitated slot geometry to determine how the antenna performance is controlled. Then, based on the parametric analysis, it was further demonstrated that the two operational bands of the antenna element could be independently controlled by changing only the geometrical dimensions of the interdigitated slot, leaving the base of the antenna entirely unaltered. As a result, the lower operating band could be fixed while the upper operating band could be shifted by up to 10%.

The design of the proposed SRAM cell utilizes orders of magnitude difference in the resistance of the insulating and metallic phases of the CM to mitigate the design conflicts. By appropriately controlling the phase transitions in the CM films during SRAM operation through device-circuit codesign, we achieve 30% higher read static noise margin and 36% increase in the write margin over standard SRAM. The proposed design also leads to a 50% reduction in the leakage current due to high insulating state of the CM. This is achieved at 28% read time penalty.

The optimum-damping control is a well-known current control method, and the proposed dynamic-slope generator can achieve frequency compensation to prevent subharmonic oscillation. When the system is disturbed, the proposed dynamic-slope generator can stabilize the circuit in a single cycle. Hence, the dynamic-slope compensation can be used to replace traditional extra slope compensation in the optimum-damping-control circuit. The measured transient time of the load current is 2 \u03bcs from 50 to 500 mA, and 3 \u03bcs from 500 to 50 mA. The optimum-damping-control techniques can rapidly reach desired output voltage in 2-3 switching cycles. The experimental and simulation results confirm that the proposed approach can achieve the slope compensation and accelerate the transient response. The proposed converter has been fabricated with TSMC 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS 1P6M technology. The converter's operating frequency is 1 MHz, the maximum output current is 500 mA, and the peak power efficiency is 89.68% under 300-mA load current.

However, multisensor array systems are able to simultaneously capture several low-resolution images from the same area on different wavelengths, forming a high spatial/spectral resolution image and raising a series of new challenges. In this paper, an open computing language based parallel implementation approach is presented for near real-time enhancement based on Bayesian maximum entropy (BME), as well as an edge-preserving denoising algorithm for remote sensing imagery, which uses the local linear Stein's unbiased risk estimate (LLSURE). BME was selected for its results on synthetic aperture radar image enhancement, whereas LLSURE has shown better noise removal properties than other commonly used methods. Within this context, image processing methods are algorithmically adapted via parallel computing techniques and efficiently implemented using CPUs and commodity graphics processing units (GPUs). Experimental results demonstrate the reduction of computational load of real-world image processing for near real-time GPU adapted implementation.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2617292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7769273/07738518.pdf","startPage":"5482","endPage":"5492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2617292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7769273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancement and Edge-Preserving Denoising: An OpenCL-Based Approach for Remote Sensing Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement and Edge-Preserving Denoising: An OpenCL-Based Approach for Remote Sensing Imagery","volume":"9","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16519100","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738518/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738518/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Conacyt Ciencia B\u00e1sica","grantNumber":"241272"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement and Edge-Preserving Denoising: An OpenCL-Based Approach for Remote Sensing Imagery","sourcePdf":"jstars-ortegonaguilar-2617292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09814S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7769273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7769273","articleId":"7738518","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738524,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Hsin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7811159/7738524/chen-2616357-small.gif","p":["Yu-Hsin Chen (S\u201911) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the focus on the architecture design and hardware implementation for deep learning accelerators.","His current research interests include energy-efficient VLSI system design, computer vision, and digital signal processing.","Mr. Chen was a recipient of the 2015 NVIDIA Graduate Fellowship and the 2015 ADI Outstanding Student Designer Award."]},"firstName":"Yu-Hsin","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-4403-956X","id":"37070897500"},{"name":"Tushar Krishna","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7811159/7738524/krish-2616357-small.gif","p":["Tushar Krishna (S\u201908\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India, in 2007, the M.S.E. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2014.","He was a Researcher with the VSSAD Group, Intel, Hudson, MA, USA, from 2013 to 2015, and a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the MIT SMART-LEES Center in 2015.

It optimizes for the energy efficiency of the entire system, including the accelerator chip and off-chip DRAM, for various CNN shapes by reconfiguring the architecture. CNNs are widely used in modern AI systems but also bring challenges on throughput and energy efficiency to the underlying hardware. This is because its computation requires a large amount of data, creating significant data movement from on-chip and off-chip that is more energy-consuming than computation. Minimizing data movement energy cost for any CNN shape, therefore, is the key to high throughput and energy efficiency. Eyeriss achieves these goals by using a proposed processing dataflow, called row stationary (RS), on a spatial architecture with 168 processing elements. RS dataflow reconfigures the computation mapping of a given shape, which optimizes energy efficiency by maximally reusing data locally to reduce expensive data movement, such as DRAM accesses. Compression and data gating are also applied to further improve energy efficiency. Eyeriss processes the convolutional layers at 35 frames/s and 0.0029 DRAM access/multiply and accumulation (MAC) for AlexNet at 278 mW (batch size N = 4), and 0.7 frames/s and 0.0035 DRAM access/MAC for VGG-16 at 236 mW (N = 3).","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2016.2616357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2016.2616357","startPage":"127","endPage":"138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7811159/07738524.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7811159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eyeriss: An Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Accelerator for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Eyeriss: An Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Accelerator for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","volume":"52","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16597810","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7738524/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eyeriss: An Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Accelerator for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jssc-chen-2616357-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16265S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7811159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"910","xplore-issue":"7811159","articleId":"7738524","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":7738527,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Ni","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Ni","id":"37085802044"},{"name":"Shiwen Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shiwen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37336142200"},{"name":"Yikai Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yikai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407079100"},{"name":"Jixin Guo","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jixin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085377980"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7738527","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":952},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Radar antennas","Interference","MIMO radar","Array signal processing","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","MIMO radar","phased array radar","radar antennas","transmitting antennas","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subarrayed time-modulated arrays","multiple-input-multiple-output radar","transmit antenna","orthogonal waveforms","unidirectional phase center motion time scheme","STM-MIMO radar technique","phased-array","coherent processing gain","waveform diversity gain","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","transmit beam pattern","receive beam pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive beamforming (ABF)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) radar","subarrayed antenna","time modulation"]}],"abstract":"A novel application of time-modulated arrays to multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar is presented and studied.

That is, the error rates of each page are highly dependent on the data content. Consequently, pages with different data will exhibit quite different error rates. However, existing technologies equipped with one uniform error correction code (ECC) scheme for all pages in a flash memory do not take the different error rates of pages into consideration. In this paper, we propose to exploit the asymmetric error rates of flash memory exhibited by the flash pages with different data for performance improvement. Before a page is programmed, its specific error rates, called content-dependent bit error rates (CDBERs), are estimated according to the content of the page. The margin between the CDBER of a page and the maximal error rates correctable by the uniform ECC code is exploited for performance improvement. On one hand, a faster and suitable write operation is selected to speed up the progress of programming while the increased speed induced CDBER does not exceed the maximal correctable error rates. On the other hand, a light-weight ECC scheme can be chosen for a faster read operation since the page decoding process of a light-weight ECC scheme incurs less time overhead. Finally, a state mapping scheme, which further reduces the CDBER through mapping high error rate states to the low error rate states of a page, is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches lead to significant write and read performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2016.2626446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2016.2626446","startPage":"1340","endPage":"1352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design

In order to compensate the impact of such variations and to respect the spectral emission masks, self-calibration systems able to estimate the output power spectral density have to be integrated in ultra-wideband impulse radio transmitters. In this paper, a new power spectral density estimation method for ultra-wideband impulse radio signals is presented. Unlike the discrete Fourier transform classically used to estimate the power spectral density, the proposed method, which is based on the measurement of the time varying envelope and instantaneous frequency of the emitted pulse, preserves a link between the time and the frequency domain thanks to a piece-wise approximation of these waveforms. This time-to-frequency link enables a straightforward pulse shape control by using simple control methods and allows to comply with spectral masks required by ultra-wideband communication regulations and standards such as the IEEE 802.15.4a. Thus, both envelope and instantaneous frequency extraction techniques are introduced for acquisition of these time domain waveforms in ultra-wideband impulse radio domain. The proposed techniques are validated and allow to consider future hardware implementation in order to build on-chip calibration systems for ultra-wideband transmitters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"64","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16706732","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7738533/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Method of Power Spectral Density Estimation for On-Chip IR-UWB Transmitter Self-Calibration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Method of Power Spectral Density Estimation for On-Chip IR-UWB Transmitter Self-Calibration","sourcePdf":"tcsi-goavec-2617887-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116113S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7862955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7862955","articleId":"7738533","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738534,"authors":[{"name":"Bharadwaj Satchidanandan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7828165/7738534/satch-2575064-small.gif","p":["\nBharadwaj Satchidanandan received the master's degree from Indian \nInstitute of Technology Madras, Tamil Nadu, India, in 2015, where he worked on wireless communications.

However, as recent events have shown, such systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Being safety critical, their disruption or misbehavior can cause economic losses or injuries and loss of life. It is therefore important to secure such networked cyber-physical systems against attacks. In the absence of credible security guarantees, there will be resistance to the proliferation of cyber-physical systems, which are much needed to meet global needs in critical infrastructures and services. This paper addresses the problem of secure control of networked cyber-physical systems. This problem is different from the problem of securing the communication network, since cyber-physical systems at their very essence need sensors and actuators that interface with the physical plant, and malicious agents may tamper with sensors or actuators, as recent attacks have shown. We consider physical plants that are being controlled by multiple actuators and sensors communicating over a network, where some sensors could be \u201cmalicious,\u201d meaning that they may not report the measurements that they observe. We address a general technique by which the actuators can detect the actions of malicious sensors in the system and disable closed-loop control based on their information. This technique, called \u201cwatermarking,\u201d employs the technique of actuators injecting private excitation into the system, which will reveal malicious tampering with signals. We show how such an active defense can be used to secure networked systems of sensors and actuators.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2016.2575064","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7828165/07738534.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2016.2575064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Watermarking: Active Defense of Networked Cyber\u2013Physical Systems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5/7828165/7738534-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738534/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Watermarking: Active Defense of Networked Cyber\u2013Physical Systems","volume":"105","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618226","htmlLink":"/document/7738534/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center","grantNumber":"CCF-0939370"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1302182"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-15-1-0279"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA-9550-13-1-0008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Dynamic Watermarking: Active Defense of Networked Cyber\u2013Physical Systems","sourcePdf":"jproc-satchidanandan-2575064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114661S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7828165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"7828165","articleId":"7738534","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7738535,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085461181"},{"name":"Soummya Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"Soummya","lastName":"Kar","id":"37295115000"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 M.

The highly conductive two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of AlGaN and GaN serves as both a sensor and a heater (via Joule heating). Microfabricated AlGaN/GaN-on-Si ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (suspended and unsuspended) were exposed to UV (365 nm) for 60 s and the transient responses were measured under various in situ heating conditions. The measured transient response showed a decay time of ~39 h when the photodetector was not heated and 24 s for a suspended photodetector with in situ 2DEG heating (270\u00b0C with a power of 75 mW). This remarkable suppression of the PPC in AlGaN/GaN UV photodetectors can be attributed to the novel device architecture and in situ heating capability, which enables acceleration of the carrier capture rate during operation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7802592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2016.2626388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/7802592/07738536.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"59","doi":"10.1109/LED.2016.2626388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppression of Persistent Photoconductivity in AlGaN/GaN Ultraviolet Photodetectors Using <i>In Situ</i> Heating","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Suppression of Persistent Photoconductivity in AlGaN/GaN Ultraviolet Photodetectors Using <i>In Situ</i> Heating","volume":"38","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7738536/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16581319","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression of Persistent Photoconductivity in AlGaN/GaN Ultraviolet Photodetectors Using <italic>In Situ</italic> Heating","sourcePdf":"led-hou-2626388-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071185S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"7802592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7802592","articleId":"7738536","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7738538,"authors":[{"name":"Shivam Prakash Gautam","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology, Raipur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7849237/7738538/gauta-2626368-small.gif","p":["Shivam Prakash Gautam (S\u201915) was born in Raipur, India, in\n 1989.

Thus, in this paper, a novel topology of multilevel inverter is proposed that can tolerate both open and short-circuit faults on its switches. The proposed topology also reduces dc sources and capacitors as compared to the conventional and recently proposed fault-tolerant topologies. Two types of solutions are provided in order to make the proposed topology fault tolerant; first provides a partial solution to fault, while the second provides a complete solution to fault. In addition, a novel switching strategy is proposed to reduce the amount of capacitor voltage ripples under normal and postfault conditions. Also, the proposed switching scheme offers an additional advantage of self-voltage balancing of its capacitor voltage both under normal as well as postfault conditions. To validate the proposed concepts, simulation and experimental analysis are carried out and different results are presented to show the viability of the proposed topology under normal operation, during fault and postfault conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738538/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668350","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7738538/","displayDocTitle":"A Single-Phase Five-Level Inverter Topology With Switch Fault-Tolerance Capabilities","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004541","fundingName":"Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Single-Phase Five-Level Inverter Topology With Switch Fault-Tolerance Capabilities","sourcePdf":"tie-gautam-2626368-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084851S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7849237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7849237","articleId":"7738538","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7738543,"authors":[{"name":"Li Feng","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Feng","orcid":"0000-0002-6404-1130","id":"38541658800"},{"name":"Qinghai Yang","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Qinghai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37288952900"},{"name":"Jinglei Li","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jinglei","lastName":"Li","id":"37598900000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7738543","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":312},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic scheduling","Resource management","Wireless networks","Waste materials","Energy consumption","Throughput","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov methods","queueing theory","radio networks","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying selfish wireless networks","virtual forwarding selfishness queue","v-FSQ","virtual receiving selfishness queue","v-RSQ","residual energy","data queue state information","Lyapunov optimization theory","dynamic rate allocation","SeWNs throughput","time-average network utility","stochastic optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Incentive mechanism","virtual selfishness queue","rate allocation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738543","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07738543.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2626294","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2626294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Selfishness Queue and Its Application","abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the node's dynamic selfishness and the rate allocation in time-varying selfish wireless networks (SeWNs).

While conventional precoding approaches aim to minimize the multi-user interference (MUI) with a total sum-power constraint at the transmitter, in the proposed scheme we consider MUI as a source of additional energy to increase the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio at the receiver. In our studies, we focus on two different CEP approaches: a first technique, where the power at each antenna is fixed to a specific value, and a two-step approach, where we first relax the power constraints to be lower than a defined parameter and then enforce CEP transmission. The algorithms are studied in terms of computational costs, with a detailed comparison between the proposed approach and the classical interference suppression schemes from the literature. Moreover, we analytically derive a robust optimization region to counteract the effects of channel-state estimation errors. The presented schemes are evaluated in terms of achievable symbol error rate in a perfect and imperfect channel-state information scenario for different modulation orders. Our results show that the proposed techniques further extend the benefits of classical CEP by judiciously relaxing the optimization region.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2626279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07738555.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2626279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant Envelope Precoding by Interference Exploitation in Phase Shift Keying-Modulated Multiuser Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Constant Envelope Precoding by Interference Exploitation in Phase Shift Keying-Modulated Multiuser Transmission","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738555/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16618434","htmlLink":"/document/7738555/","volume":"16","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"Royal Academy of Engineering, U.K."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council project","grantNumber":"EP/M014150/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Constant Envelope Precoding by Interference Exploitation in Phase Shift Keying-Modulated Multiuser Transmission","sourcePdf":"twc-amadori-2626279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091321S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7738555","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738559,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Aizu, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7927510/7738559/li-2626285-small.gif","p":["Peng Li (S\u201910-M\u201912) received the BS degree from Huazhong\n University of Science and Technology, China, in 2007, and the MS and PhD degrees from the University of Aizu, Japan,\n in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

As the fast growth of various global services, there is an increasing need for big data analytics across multiple data centers (DCs) located in different countries or regions. It asks for the support of a cross-DC data processing platform optimized for the geo-distributed computing environment. Although some recent efforts have been made for geo-distributed big data analytics, they cannot guarantee predictable job completion time, and would incur excessive traffic overthe inter-DC network that is a scarce resource shared by many applications. In this paper, we study to minimize the inter-DC traffic generated by MapReduce jobs targeting on geo-distributed big data, while providing predicted job completion time. To achieve this goal, we formulate an optimization problem by jointly considering input data movement and task placement. Furthermore, we guarantee predictable job completion time by applying the chance-constrained optimization technique, such that the MapReduce job can finish within a predefined job completion time with high probability. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we conduct extensive simulations using real traces generated by a set of queries on Hive. The results show that our proposal can reduce 55 percent inter-DC traffic compared with centralized processing by aggregating all data to a single data center.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2016.2626285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7927510/07738559.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2016.2626285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7927510","startPage":"1785","endPage":"1796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic-Aware Geo-Distributed Big Data Analytics with Predictable Job Completion Time","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738559","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/71/7927510/7738559-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Traffic-Aware Geo-Distributed Big Data Analytics with Predictable Job Completion Time","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"6","publicationDate":"1 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16880880","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7738559/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000646","fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"16K16038"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61572262"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20141427"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery","grantNumber":"A7921"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Traffic-Aware Geo-Distributed Big Data Analytics with Predictable Job Completion Time","sourcePdf":"tpds-li-2626285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09633S","chronDate":"June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7927510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7927510","articleId":"7738559","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738560,"authors":[{"name":"Gi Seok Park","affiliation":["Division of IT Convergence Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Nam-gu, Pohang-si, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/8000754/7738560/park-2626434-small.gif","p":["Gi Seok Park received the BS (summa cum laude)\n degree in electrical engineering from Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea, in 2010, and the MS degree in IT convergence\n engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Korea, in 2013.

In the proposed system, the main functionalities of the content centric networking (CCN) technology are deployed for efficient and fast cached content management at the base stations and in the devices. First, a logical overlay Chord-like network is constructed among the smart base stations for effectively handling significant numbers of the distributed contents. Then, content management protocols over the Chord-like network are implemented for rapidly finding the D2D server that contains the cached content requested by the D2D client. A two-stage PID-based LTE traffic controller is proposed to determine the amount of traffic to be offloaded to the D2D network among the cellular operator, the D2D servers, and the D2D clients. The proposed system is fully implemented using a CCNx open source and C/C++. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance improvement of the proposed system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile

transmitter antenna and multiple receiver antennas [single-input multiple-output (SIMO)]. The hexagonal constellation has a densely packed 2-D \u201choneycomb\u201d structure and is more energy efficient than the commonly used cross quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. By using the hexagonal lattice formed from the Eisenstein integers and the recently developed concept of the uniquely factorable constellation (UFC) for the QAM constellation, an algorithm is developed to effectively and efficiently construct constant norm hexagonal UFCs of various sizes. In addition, an optimal energy scale is found to maximize the coding gain for the constant norm training hexagonal UFC schemes subject to a transmission bit rate constraint. Computer simulations show that the hexagonal unitary UFC proposed in this paper has the best error performance in comparison to the current literature results for the noncoherent SIMO system.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2626245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07738563.pdf","startPage":"5495","endPage":"5501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2626245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uniquely Factorable Hexagonal Constellation Designs for Noncoherent SIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738563/","displayDocTitle":"Uniquely Factorable Hexagonal Constellation Designs for Noncoherent SIMO Systems","volume":"66","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965015","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738563/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniquely Factorable Hexagonal Constellation Designs for Noncoherent SIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2626245-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079987S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7738563","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738572,"authors":[{"name":"Marwa Ben Sa\u00efd-Romdhane","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Syst\u00e8mes Electriques, Ecole Nationale d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Tunis, Tunis le Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, Tunisie"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7909058/7738572/romdh-2626290-small.gif","p":["Marwa Ben Sa\u00efd-Romdhane was born in 1987 in Tunisia.

Active damping methods, without power losses, are preferred to passive ones for solving the resonance problems of LCL-filter-based GcCs ( LCL-GcCs). However, large changes in the grid inductance (typically under weak grid conditions and in rural areas) may compromise the system stability. Moreover, the delay of digital controllers will change system phase-frequency characteristics and consequently will affect the system stability. In view of this, this paper proposes a systematic design procedure for the active damping of voltage-oriented PI control for LCL- GcCs. The procedure considers active damping methods based on capacitor current feedback and is aimed to ensure stable operation under severe grid inductance variations while taking into account the influence of digital control delay and LCL filter parameters changes on the system stability. Simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed in order to validate the proposed design procedure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738572/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"16838248","volume":"32","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Active Damping Methods for LCL Filter-Based Grid-Connected Converters","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Tunisian Ministry of High Education and Research","grantNumber":"LSE-ENIT-LR11ES15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Active Damping Methods for LCL Filter-Based Grid-Connected Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-bensaidromdhane-2626290-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119188S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7909058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7909058","articleId":"7738572","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7738573,"authors":[{"name":"Weicong Kong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7738573/kong-2626389-small.gif","p":["Weicong Kong (S\u201914) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K., in 2009.

Energy disaggregation could be one of the potential approaches to exploit the massive amount of smart meter data to fulfill the task. Proper individual home appliance modeling is critical to the performance of NILM. In this paper, a hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) framework to model home appliances is proposed. This model aims to provide better representation for those appliances that have multiple built-in modes with distinct power consumption profiles, such as washing machines and dishwashers. The dynamic Bayesian network representation of such an appliance model is built. A forward-backward algorithm, which is based on the framework of expectation maximization, is formalized for the HHMM fitting process. Tests on publically available data show that the HHMM and proposed algorithm can effectively handle the modeling of appliances with multiple functional modes, as well as better representing a general type of appliances. A disaggregation test also demonstrates that the fitted HHMM can be easily applied to a general inference solver to outperform conventional hidden Markov model in the estimation of energy disaggregation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07738573.pdf","startPage":"3079","endPage":"3090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2626389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2626389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model Framework for Home Appliance Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Home appliances","Fitting","Load modeling","Smart meters","Power demand","Bayes methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","distribution networks","domestic appliances","expectation-maximisation algorithm","hidden Markov models","load management","smart meters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy disaggregation","load characteristics","distribution network operators","hierarchical hidden Markov model","home appliance modeling","distinct power consumption","HHMM fitting process","forward-backward algorithm","dynamic Bayesian network representation","smart meter data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hierarchical hidden Markov model","energy disaggregation","residential load modelling","expectation maximization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model Framework for Home Appliance Modeling","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7738573/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857452","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Education Australia through Endeavour Postgraduate Scholarship scheme"},{"fundingName":"Sydney University Bridge Grant and the Faculty Research Cluster Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005311","fundingName":"China Southern Power Grid Company","grantNumber":"WYKJ00000027"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001774","fundingName":"Early Career Research Development Scheme of Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Sydney, Australia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model Framework for Home Appliance Modeling","sourcePdf":"tsg-dong-2626389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08006S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7738573","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738576,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Haghighi Ardakani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7738576/ardak-2626438-small.gif","p":["Maryam Haghighi Ardakani received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2016.

In comparison to infrared counterparts, UV links are subject to relatively higher path loss as well as intersymbol interference resulting from frequency selective nature of the channel. In this paper, we propose the powerful combination of relay-assisted transmission and multi-carrier architecture based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Specifically, we consider a cooperative diversity system with orthogonal cooperation protocol and use DC-biased optical OFDM as the underlying physical layer. We consider both amplify-and-forward (AF) and detect-and-forward (DF) relaying. We investigate the error rate performance of the proposed relay-assisted OFDM UV system under consideration and demonstrate performance gains over point-to-point OFDM UV systems. We further determine optimal power allocation schemes to improve the performance. We also propose a variable-rate UV OFDM system and improve system throughput via bit loading.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay-Assisted OFDM for Ultraviolet Communications: Performance Analysis and Optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2626438","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07738576.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2626438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738576/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Relay-Assisted OFDM for Ultraviolet Communications: Performance Analysis and Optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7738576/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618438","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay-Assisted OFDM for Ultraviolet Communications: Performance Analysis and Optimization","sourcePdf":"twc-haghighiardakani-2626438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093538S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7738576","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738578,"authors":[{"name":"Israfil Bahceci","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7738578/bahce-2626291-small.gif","p":["Israfil Bahceci (S\u201901\u2013M\u201906) received the B.S. degree from Bilkent University, Turkey, in 1999, the M.S. degree from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2005, all in electrical engineering.

However, in coherent communication systems, using MR-MIMO antennas with a large number of operational modes may incur prohibitive complexity due to the need for channel state estimation for each mode. To address this issue, we derive an explicit relation among the radiation patterns for the antenna modes and the resulting channel gains. We propose a joint channel estimation/prediction scheme where only a subset of all the antenna modes is trained for estimation, and then, the channels associated with the modes that are not trained are predicted using the correlations among the different antenna modes. We propose various training mechanisms with reduced overhead and improved estimation performance, and study the impact of channel estimation error and training overhead on the MR-MIMO system performance. We demonstrate that one can achieve significantly improved data rates and lower error probabilities utilizing the proposed approaches. For instance, under practical settings, we observe about 25% throughput increase or about 3-dB signal-to-noise ratio improvement under the same training overhead with respect to non-reconfigurable antenna systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Channel Estimation for Reconfigurable MIMO Antennas: Training Techniques and Performance Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2626291","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07738578.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2626291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738578/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Channel Estimation for Reconfigurable MIMO Antennas: Training Techniques and Performance Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7738578/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618444","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"AFOSR","grantNumber":"FA 9550-15-1-0040 DEF"},{"fundingName":"EC Marie Curie Career Integration","grantNumber":"PCIG12-GA-2012-334213"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Channel Estimation for Reconfigurable MIMO Antennas: Training Techniques and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"twc-bahceci-2626291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098293S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7738578","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738579,"authors":[{"name":"Mianzhi Wang","affiliation":["Preston M.

By exploiting the coarray structure, an augmented sample covariance matrix can be constructed and MUtiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) can be applied to identify more sources than the number of sensors. While such a MUSIC algorithm works quite well, its performance has not been theoretically analyzed. In this paper, we derive a simplified asymptotic mean square error (MSE) expression for the MUSIC algorithm applied to the coarray model, which is applicable even if the source number exceeds the sensor number. We show that the directly augmented sample covariance matrix and the spatial smoothed sample covariance matrix yield the same asymptotic MSE for MUSIC. We also show that when there are more sources than the number of sensors, the MSE converges to a positive value instead of zero when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to infinity.

The proposed controller can achieve prescribed transient and steady-state performance, despite uncertain time delays and output constraints as well as actuation faults. By combining a tangent barrier Lyapunov-Krasovskii function with the dynamic surface control technique, the neural network unit in the developed control scheme is able to take its action from the very beginning and play its learning/approximating role safely during the entire system operational envelope, leading to enhanced control performance without the danger of violating compact set precondition. Furthermore, prescribed transient performance and output constraints are strictly ensured in the presence of nonaffine uncertainties, external disturbances, and undetectable actuation faults. The control strategy is also validated by numerical simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2619914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8262690/07738580.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2619914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8262690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuroadaptive Fault-Tolerant Control of Nonlinear Systems Under Output Constraints and Actuation Faults","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738580/","displayDocTitle":"Neuroadaptive Fault-Tolerant Control of Nonlinear Systems Under Output Constraints and Actuation Faults","volume":"29","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17519484","pubMedId":"27845679","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738580/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Major State Basic Research Development Program 973","grantNumber":"2012CB215202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61134001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuroadaptive Fault-Tolerant Control of Nonlinear Systems Under Output Constraints and Actuation Faults","sourcePdf":"tnnls-song-2619914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115765S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8262690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8262690","articleId":"7738580","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738585,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Global Big Data Technologies Centre, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7738585/yang-2626360-small.gif","p":["Tao Yang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201910) received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Beihang University), Beijing, China, in 2003, and the master\u2019s by research and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, NSW, Australia, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.

The CU is connected to the BSs via K independent rate-constrained fronthaul (FH) links. The distributed BSs collectively serve the users through the air. We propose a new network coding based distributed MIMO broadcasting scheme, using reverse compute-and-forward and signal-space alignment. At the CU, a network coding generator matrix is employed for pre network coding of the users' messages. The network coded messages are forwarded to the BSs, where the FH rate-constraint determines the actual number of network-coded messages forwarded to the BSs. At the BSs, linear precoding matrices are designed to create a number of bins, each containing a bunch of spatial streams with aligned signal-spaces. At each user, post physical-layer network coding is employed to compute linear combinations over the NC messages with respect to the bins, which reverses the prenetwork coding and recovers the desired messages. We derive an achievable rate of the proposed scheme based on the existence of NC generator matrix, signal-space alignment precoding matrices, and nested lattice codes. Improved rate and degrees of freedom over existing interference alignment and compress-and-forward schemes are shown. Numerical results demonstrate the performance improvement, e.g., by as much as 70% increase in throughput over benchmark schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2626360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07738585.pdf","startPage":"581","endPage":"593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2626360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed MIMO Broadcasting: Reverse Compute-and-Forward and Signal-Space Alignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738585/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed MIMO Broadcasting: Reverse Compute-and-Forward and Signal-Space Alignment","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618456","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738585/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award","grantNumber":"DE150100636"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed MIMO Broadcasting: Reverse Compute-and-Forward and Signal-Space Alignment","sourcePdf":"twc-yang-2626360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100559S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7738585","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738586,"authors":[{"name":"I-Hsin Chung","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

DNNs are the state-of-the-art models used in image recognition, object detection, classification and tracking, and speech and language processing applications. The biggest drawback to DNNs has been the enormous cost in computation and time taken to train the parameters of the networks-often a tenfold increase relative to conventional technologies. Such training time costs can be mitigated by the application of parallel computing algorithms and architectures. However, these algorithms often run into difficulties because of the cost of inter-processor communication bottlenecks. In this paper, we describe how to enable Parallel Deep Neural Network Training on the IBM Blue Gene/Q (BG/Q) computer system. Specifically, we explore DNN training using the data-parallel Hessian-free 2nd order optimization algorithm. Such an algorithm is particularly well-suited to parallelization across a large set of loosely coupled processors. BG/Q, with its excellent inter-processor communication characteristics, is an ideal match for this type of algorithm. The paper discusses how issues regarding programming model and data-dependent imbalances are addressed. Results on large-scale speech tasks show that the performance on BG/Q scales linearly up to 4,096 processes with no loss in accuracy. This allows us to train neural networks using billions of training examples in a few hours.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7927510/07738586.pdf","startPage":"1703","endPage":"1714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Deep Neural Network Training for Big Data on Blue Gene/Q","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2016.2626289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7927510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2016.2626289","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Deep Neural Network Training for Big Data on Blue Gene/Q","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16880881","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7738586/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Deep Neural Network Training for Big Data on Blue Gene/Q","sourcePdf":"tpds-chung-2626289-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121529S","chronDate":"June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7927510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7927510","articleId":"7738586","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738592,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Determe","affiliation":["OPERA Wireless Communications Group, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium","ICTEAM Department, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7765219/7738592/deter-2626244-small.gif","p":["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Determe (S\u201914) received the Electrical Engineering degree (Master en ing\u00e9nieur civil \u00e9lectricien) from the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Bruxelles, Belgium, in 2013.

Each sparse signal is acquired using the same noisy linear measurement process, which returns fewer observations than the dimension of the sparse signals. The measurement noise is assumed additive, Gaussian, and admits different variances for each sparse signal that is measured. Using the theory of compressed sensing, the performance of simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) is analyzed for the envisioned signal model. The cornerstone of this paper is a novel analysis method upper bounding the probability that SOMP recovers at least one incorrect entry of the joint support during a prescribed number of iterations. Furthermore, the probability of SOMP failing is investigated whenever the number of sparse signals being recovered simultaneously increases and tends to infinity. In particular, convincing observations and theoretical results suggest that SOMP committing no mistake in the noiseless case does not guarantee the absence of error in the noisy case whenever the number of acquired sparse signals scales to infinity. Finally, simulation results confirm the validity of the theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2626244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7765219/07738592.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2626244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Noise Robustness of Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738592","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7765219/7738592-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738592/","displayDocTitle":"On the Noise Robustness of Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit","volume":"65","issue":"4","publicationDate":"15 Feb.1,  2017","accessionNumber":"16518860","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738592/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Belgian National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"On the Noise Robustness of Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit","sourcePdf":"tsp-determe-2626244-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107555S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7765219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7765219","articleId":"7738592","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7738598,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Zappone","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7765219/7738598/zappo-2626249-small.gif","p":["Alessio Zappone (S\u201908\u2013M\u201911\u2013SM\u201916)\n received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy.

After observing that such a scenario models both cognitive radio and D2D communications, we formulate the problem as the maximization of the secondary energy efficiency subject to a minimum rate requirement for the primary user. This leads to challenging nonconvex, fractional problems. In the underlay scenario, we obtain the global solution by means of a suitable reformulation. In the overlay scenario, two algorithms are proposed. The first one yields a resource allocation fulfilling the first-order optimality conditions of the resource allocation problem, by solving a sequence of easier fractional programs. The second one enjoys a weaker optimality claim, but an even lower computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithms both in terms of energy-efficient performance and complexity, also showing that the two proposed algorithms for the overlay scenario perform very similarly, despite the different complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2626249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7765219/07738598.pdf","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2626249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency in MIMO Underlay and Overlay Device-to-Device Communications and Cognitive Radio Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738598/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency in MIMO Underlay and Overlay Device-to-Device Communications and Cognitive Radio Systems","volume":"65","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16518871","htmlLink":"/document/7738598/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG)","grantNumber":"ZA 747/1-3"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"German Research Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency in MIMO Underlay and Overlay Device-to-Device Communications and Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-zappone-2626249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122457S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7765219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7765219","articleId":"7738598","onlineDate":"08 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7738673,"authors":[{"name":"Takuya Okuyama","affiliation":["Research & Development Group, Hitachi, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Okuyama","id":"37085500335"},{"name":"Chihiro Yoshimura","affiliation":["Research & Development Group, Hitachi, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Chihiro","lastName":"Yoshimura","id":"38086029400"},{"name":"Masato Hayashi","affiliation":["Research & Development Group, Hitachi, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37085671101"},{"name":"Masanao Yamaoka","affiliation":["Research & Development Group, Hitachi, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanao","lastName":"Yamaoka","id":"37275972800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1370-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1371-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738673","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":463},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","combinatorial mathematics","computer architecture","electronic engineering computing","Ising model","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computing architecture","approximated simulated annealing","Ising models","combinatorial optimization problems","von Neumann architecture","semiconductor scaling","ground state search","circuit operations","CMOS circuits","majority function","Glauber dynamics","power-efficient architecture"]}],"abstract":"In the near future, the techniques to solve combinatorial optimization problems will become important in various fields and require large computing power. However, the performance growth of von Neumann architecture will slow down due to the end of semiconductor scaling. To resolve this problem, a computing architecture is proposed that maps the optimization problems to the ground state search of Ising models. The authors implemented the architecture, which finds the ground state by circuit operations inspired by SA, in CMOS circuits. The architecture adopts a modified algorithm using a majority function to simplify circuits. Though the power efficiency can be estimated to be 1800 times higher than that of a CPU, the modification deteriorates solution quality because it breaks the detailed balance condition. This paper presents a computing architecture that performs SA for Ising models approximately. The architecture satisfies the condition by utilizing the fact that the output of the majority voter circuit with stochastically processed inputs approximately behaves in accordance with the Glauber dynamics. Simulations demonstrate that solution quality of the proposed architecture is as good as that of SA.

In this paper, we demonstrate that multiple approximation techniques can be applied to applications in these domains and can be further combined together to compound their benefits. In assessing the potential of approximation in these applications, we took the liberty of changing multiple layers of the system stack: architecture, programming model, and algorithms. Across a set of applications spanning the domains of DSP, robotics, and machine learning, we show that hot loops in the applications can be perforated by an average of 50% with proportional reduction in execution time, while still producing acceptable quality of results. In addition, the width of the data used in the computation can be reduced to 10-16 bits from the currently common 32/64 bits with potential for significant performance and energy benefits. For parallel applications we reduced execution time by 50% using relaxed synchronization mechanisms. Finally, our results also demonstrate that benefits compounded when these techniques are applied concurrently. Our results across different applications demonstrate that approximate computing is a widely applicable paradigm with potential for compounded benefits from applying multiple techniques across the system stack. In order to exploit these benefits it is essential to re-think multiple layers of the system stack to embrace approximations ground-up and to design tightly integrated approximate accelerators. Doing so will enable moving the applications into a world in which the architecture, programming model, and even the algorithms used to implement the application are all fundamentally designed for approximate computing.","doi":"10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738674","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733896/7738669/07738674.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate computing: Challenges and opportunities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Approximate computing: Challenges and opportunities","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738674/","accessionNumber":"16450531","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate computing: Challenges and opportunities","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087853S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738675,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen P.

Adiabatic reversible logic was examined in the 1980s and 1990s but in that era power dissipation was a secondary concern, and the trade-off of reduced computational speed for reduced power was deemed unacceptable. Now, power dissipation and the associated heat are the major obstacles limiting progress in integrated circuits, particularly processors. In modern processors trading performance for reduced power dissipation is already done using techniques such as multi-core and dark silicon, so adiabatic logic may now be an attractive approach. To evaluate the adiabatic approach, this paper uses the figure of merit of the product of switching energy, delay time, and area (EDA). Using this figure of merit, adiabatic logic is shown to be advantageous when additional constraints are considered, such as maximum allowed power density. As a proof of concept circuit, a simplified MIPS microprocessor was designed using adiabatic logic based on split-rail charge recovery logic and Bennett clocking. New design and verification tools were developed using structural Verilog and extensions of ModelSim to provide needed capabilities are not available in commercial packages. The design is implemented using a standard cell design.","doi":"10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738678","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733896/7738669/07738678.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mini-MIPS microprocessor for adiabatic computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738678/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Mini-MIPS microprocessor for adiabatic computing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16450538","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738678/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mini-MIPS microprocessor for adiabatic computing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079386S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738680,"authors":[{"name":"Jennifer Hasler","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Hasler","id":"37071711000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1370-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1371-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738680","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":603},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable analog arrays","Computational modeling","Turing machines","Computers","Neuromorphics","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue computers","power aware computing","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog realization","digital computation","analog computation","programmable physical computing systems","configurable physical computing systems","ultralow power physical computing systems","energy efficient computation","analog numerical analysis","unified analog-computing framework","quantum computing"]}],"abstract":"In the past, discussions on the capability of analog or physical computing were only of theoretical interest.

Brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) explores the emulation of cognition by computing with hypervectors as an alternative to computing with numbers. Hypervectors are high-dimensional, holographic, and (pseudo)random with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) components. These features provide an opportunity for energy-efficient computing applied to cyberbiological and cybernetic systems.

Our algorithm encodes a stream of analog EMG signals that are simultaneously generated from four channels to a single hypervector. The proposed encoding effectively captures spatial and temporal relations across and within the channels to represent a gesture. This HDC encoder achieves a high level of classification accuracy (97.8%) with only 1/3 the training data required by state-of-the-art SVM on the same task. HDC exhibits fast and accurate learning explicitly allowing online and continuous learning. We further enhance the encoder to adaptively mitigate the effect of gesture-timing uncertainties across different subjects endogenously; further, the encoder inherently maintains the same accuracy when there is up to 30% overlapping between two consecutive gestures in a classification window.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738683/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16450565","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738683/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hyperdimensional biosignal processing: A case study for EMG-based hand gesture recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperdimensional biosignal processing: A case study for EMG-based hand gesture recognition","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104742S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7738684,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Fumarola","affiliation":["IBM Research-Almaden, San Jose, CA","EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Fumarola","id":"37085880874"},{"name":"Pritish Narayanan","affiliation":["IBM Research-Almaden, San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Pritish","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"37543543700"},{"name":"Lucas L.

The solution proposed in this paper is taking advantage of the fantastic features of stochastic computing methods. Stochastic computing is a type of data representation and processing technique, which uses a binary bit stream to represent a probability number (by counting the number of ones in this bit stream). In the stochastic computing area, some key arithmetic operations such as additions or multiplications can be implemented with very simple components like AND gates or multiplexers, respectively. Thus it provides an immense design space for integrating a large amount of neurons and enabling fully parallel and scalable hardware implementations of large-scale deep learning systems. In this paper, we present a reconfigurable large-scale deep learning system based on stochastic computing technologies, including the design of the neuron, the convolution function, the back-propagation function and some other basic operations. And the network-on-chip technique is also proposed in this paper to achieve the goal of implementing a large-scale hardware system. Our experiments validate the functionality of reconfigurable deep learning systems using stochastic computing, and demonstrate that when the bit streams are set to be 8192 bits, classification of MNIST digits by stochastic computing can perform as low error rate as that by normal arithmetic operations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733896/7738669/07738685.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","doi":"10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing reconfigurable large-scale deep learning systems using stochastic computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Neurons","Hardware","Stochastic processes","Biological neural networks","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","data structures","learning (artificial intelligence)","network-on-chip","neural nets","parallel architectures","probability","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable large-scale deep learning systems","stochastic computing","machine learning","neural network","high-performance server clusters","mobile devices","personal devices","data representation","data processing","probability number","key arithmetic operations","AND gates","multiplexers","parallel scalable hardware implementations","backpropagation function","network-on-chip","large-scale hardware system","MNIST digit classification","normal arithmetic operations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stochastic computing","deep learning","neuron","reconfigurable","large-scale"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Designing reconfigurable large-scale deep learning systems using stochastic computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738685/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16450544","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing reconfigurable large-scale deep learning systems using stochastic computing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092806S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738687,"authors":[{"name":"Anvesh Polepalli","affiliation":["Nanocomputing Research Lab, Rochester Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Anvesh","lastName":"Polepalli","id":"37085901122"},{"name":"Nicholas Soures","affiliation":["Nanocomputing Research Lab, Rochester Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Soures","id":"37085886119"},{"name":"Dhireesha Kudithipudi","affiliation":["Nanocomputing Research Lab, Rochester Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Dhireesha","lastName":"Kudithipudi","id":"37282444800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1370-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1371-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738687","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Liquids","Hardware","Brain models","Training","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital neuromorphic design","liquid state machine","LSM","reservoir computing","spatio-temporal data processing","information extraction","feature extraction","spatio-temporal applications","EEG seizure detection","electroencephalography","user identification","walking pattern"]}],"abstract":"The Liquid State Machine (LSM) is a form of reservoir computing which emulates the brains capability of processing spatio-temporal data.

However, their wider use is still hindered by the lack of algorithms that can harness the strengths of such architectures. While neuromorphic adaptations of representation learning algorithms are now emerging, the efficient processing of temporal sequences or variable length-inputs remains difficult, partly due to challenges in representing and configuring the dynamics of spiking neural networks. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used in machine learning to solve a variety of sequence learning tasks. In this work we present a train-and-constrain methodology that enables the mapping of machine learned (Elman) RNNs on a substrate of spiking neurons, while being compatible with the capabilities of current and near-future neuromorphic systems. This \u201ctrain-and-constrain\u201d method consists of first training RNNs using backpropagation through time, then discretizing the weights and finally converting them to spiking RNNs by matching the responses of artificial neurons with those of the spiking neurons. We demonstrate our approach by mapping a natural language processing task (question classification), where we demonstrate the entire mapping process of the recurrent layer of the network on IBM's Neurosynaptic System TrueNorth, a spike-based digital neuromorphic hardware architecture. TrueNorth imposes specific constraints on connectivity, neural and synaptic parameters. To satisfy these constraints, it was necessary to discretize the synaptic weights to 16 levels, discretize the neural activities to 16 levels, and to limit fan-in to 64 inputs. Surprisingly, we find that short synaptic delays are sufficient to implement the dynamic (temporal) aspect of the RNN in the question classification task. Furthermore we observed that the discretization of the neural activities is beneficial to our train-and-constrain approach. The hardware-constrained model achieved 74% accuracy in question classification while using less than 0.025% of the cores on one TrueNorth chip, resulting in an estimated power consumption of \u2248 17\u03bcW.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738691/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16450528","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738691/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Conversion of artificial recurrent neural networks to spiking neural networks for low-power neuromorphic hardware","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conversion of artificial recurrent neural networks to spiking neural networks for low-power neuromorphic hardware","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108999S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7738692,"authors":[{"name":"Craig M.

In particular, there is a need for a richer understanding of the role of adaptivity in neural learning to provide a foundation upon which architectures and devices may be built. Modern machine learning algorithms lack adaptive learning, in that they are dominated by a costly training phase after which they no longer learn. The brain on the other hand is continuously learning and provides a basis for which new mathematical theories may be developed to greatly enrich the computational capabilities of learning systems. Game theory provides one alternative mathematical perspective analyzing strategic interactions and as such is well suited to learning theory.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733896/7738669/07738692.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738692","doi":"10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overcoming the Static Learning Bottleneck - the need for adaptive neural learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Overcoming the Static Learning Bottleneck - the need for adaptive neural learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738692/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738692/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16450530","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overcoming the Static Learning Bottleneck - the need for adaptive neural learning","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03572S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738693,"authors":[{"name":"Chenchen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Chenchen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085379662"},{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085860029"},{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Li","id":"37085382591"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1370-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1371-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738693","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Arrays","Neuromorphics","Engines","Image recognition","Hardware","Digital images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue storage","matrix algebra","memristors","network synthesis","neural nets","program processors","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural processor design","matrix-vector multiplication","computing operation","memristor crossbar","analog storage states","integration density","parallel execution","spiking-based design","levelbased design","digital image recognition","heuristic flow","device modeling","circuit design","nanoscale memristor technology","spiking neuromorphic engine","resistive device imperfection","level-based computing engine"]}],"abstract":"Matrix-vector multiplication is a key computing operation in neural processor design and hence greatly affects the execution efficiency. Memristor crossbar is highly attractive for the implementation of matrix-vector multiplication for its analog storage states, high integration density, and built-in parallel execution. The current deign schemes can be generally divided into two different approaches - \u201cspiking-based\u201d design and \u201clevelbased\u201d design. The performance and robustness of the proposed neural process designs are also evaluated by using the application of digital image recognition. In this work, a heuristic flow including device modeling, circuit design, architecture, and algorithm is studied. The proposed neural processor designs that leverages nano-scale memristor technology are summarize and compared. This work indicates that the spiking neuromorphic engine has a good tolerance in resistive device imperfection, but more vulnerable to the fluctuations in output spike generation. The improved level-based computing engine has a higher computation accuracy with better stability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural processor design enabled by memristor technology","doi":"10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738693","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738669","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733896/7738669/07738693.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Neural processor design enabled by memristor technology","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738693/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16450563","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural processor design enabled by memristor technology","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048792S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738694,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey M.

Most interest in ANNs targets acceleration of deep multi-layered ANNs that can require days of offline training to converge on a desired network behavior. Interest has grown in ANNs capable of supporting unsupervised training, where networks can learn new information from unlabeled data dynamically without the need for offline training. These ANNs require large memories with bandwidths much higher than supported in modern GPGPUs. Custom hardware acceleration and memory co-design holds the potential to provide real-time performance in cases where the performance requirements cannot be met by modern GPGPUs. This work presents a custom processor solution to accelerate two hetero-associative memories (Sparsey and HTM) capable of unsupervised and one-hot learning. This custom processor is implemented as an expandable ASIP built upon a configurable SIMD engine for exploiting parallelism. Functional specialization is implemented utilizing processor-in-memory techniques, which results in up to a 20\u00d7 speedup and a 2000\u00d7 reduction in energy per frame compared to a software implementation operating on a dataset for recognition of human actions.","doi":"10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738697","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733896/7738669/07738697.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processor-in-memory support for artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Processor-in-memory support for artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16450564","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738697/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processor-in-memory support for artificial neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072731S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7738698,"authors":[{"name":"Kaya Can Akyel","affiliation":["CEA, Univ.

Representing bits by molecular configuration, rather than a current switch, yields the limits of functional density and low power dissipation. Matching a new computational element to a new architectural framework could enable general purpose computing to evolve along a new roadmap.","doi":"10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738699","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733896/7738669/07738699.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738699","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Molecular cellular networks: A non von Neumann architecture for molecular electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Molecular cellular networks: A non von Neumann architecture for molecular electronics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738699/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738699/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16463826","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Molecular cellular networks: A non von Neumann architecture for molecular electronics","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.164304S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7738700,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Riente","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Electronics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Riente","id":"38489902200"},{"name":"Grazvydas Ziemys","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Electronics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Grazvydas","lastName":"Ziemys","id":"37085465231"},{"name":"Giovanna Turvani","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Electronics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Giovanna","lastName":"Turvani","id":"38490415700"},{"name":"Doris Schmitt-Landsiedel","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Electronics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Doris","lastName":"Schmitt-Landsiedel","id":"38270167300"},{"name":"Stephan Breitkreutz-v.

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of a monolithic 3D pNML circuit, which is capable of integrating both memory and logic onto the same device on different layers by exploiting the novel Logic-In-Memory (LIM) concept. The LIM can be exploited by placing magnetic memory elements (registers) in a memory layer, which is located monolithically just below the performing logic plane and interconnected by pure-magnetic vias. In particular, the nonvolatile magnetization state of the bistable, nanoscaled magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is exploited to build a magnetic D flip-flop. This basic memory element is then used to build a more compact and a more power efficient N-bit parallel-in parallel-out register. Indeed, the presented magnetic flip-flop implementation is two orders of magnitude more compact when compared to the 32nm CMOS version. The approach has been studied by considering the implementation of an accumulator (adder plus memory) as case study. Moreover, we compare the occupied area of a N-bit accumulator with the 45nm and 28nm CMOS technology nodes. This novel concept enables the storage of information locally on the computing chip, saving area and employing the strengths of pNML for next-generation, memory-intensive computing tasks.","doi":"10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738700","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733896/7738669/07738700.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738669","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Logic-In-Memory circuits using 3D-integrated Nanomagnetic logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Logic-In-Memory circuits using 3D-integrated Nanomagnetic logic","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738700/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16463831","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738700/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Logic-In-Memory circuits using 3D-integrated Nanomagnetic logic","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123552S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738703,"authors":[{"name":"Eyob A.

Among them, the use of memristive devices for neuromorphic computing is one of the most promising applications. Here, we present an especially for neuromorphic computing attractive quantum mechanical memristive device which offers the benefits of an intrinsic current compliance, a gradual resistance change, and no need for an initial electric forming procedure. Our findings indicate that a homogenous interfacial effect is responsible for the observed memristive I-V curves rather than locally confined filaments.

For this purpose the important issues of the respective energy barriers and ultra-thin memristive layers are investigated. Experimental findings are supported by an equivalent circuit model which furthermore provides a better understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms and allows the identification of essential fabrication parameters. Electrical characteristics are investigated and discussed in the framework of their capability to emulate synaptic functionality. Finally, the pros and cons of the double-barrier devices are discussed with respect to their possible applications in novel neuromorphic circuits.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric measurements","Neuromorphics","Thickness measurement","Gold","Artificial intelligence","Niobium","Atmosphere"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","memristors","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double barrier memristive devices","neuromorphic computing","memory applications","attractive quantum mechanical memristive device","gradual resistance change","electric forming procedure","homogenous interfacial effect","memristive I-V curves","tunnel barrier","probability","electron tunneling","energy barriers","ultra-thin memristive layers","equivalent circuit model","synaptic functionality","neuromorphic circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memristive devices","non-volatile memory","neuromorphic computing","electron tunneling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738713","doi":"10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738713","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733896/7738669/07738713.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738713/","displayDocTitle":"Double barrier memristive devices for neuromorphic computing","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16450536","htmlLink":"/document/7738713/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double barrier memristive devices for neuromorphic computing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109279S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738716,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Policarpo Duarte","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Instituto Superior Tecnico Universidade Tecnica de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui Policarpo","lastName":"Duarte","id":"38186138500"},{"name":"Hor\u00e1cio Neto","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Instituto Superior Tecnico Universidade Tecnica de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Hor\u00e1cio","lastName":"Neto","id":"37300331900"},{"name":"M\u00e1rio V\u00e9stias","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Instituto Politecnico de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"M\u00e1rio","lastName":"V\u00e9stias","id":"37300332700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1370-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1371-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738716","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738716","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Pulse width modulation","Clocks","Computer architecture","Adders","Radiation detectors","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyber-physical systems","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XtokaxtikoX","autonomous cyber-physical system","data-path","stochastic computing systems","stochastic bitstreams","stochastic arithmetic units","Cyclone IV FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stochastic computing","FPGA","cyber-physical reconfigurable system","fault tolerance"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents XtokaxtikoX, a fully autonomous cyber-physical system employing only stochastic arithmetic to perform computations on its data-path. Traditional implementations of stochastic computing systems benefit from fast and compact implementation of arithmetic operators, and high tolerance to errors, but depend heavily on the conversion between stochastic bitstreams and binary to implement many parts of the system. Furthermore, if a system requires any interaction with analog electronic components it must have additional ADC/DAC conversion circuitry, which further increases the complexity of the system. Conversely, the proposed work is able to directly translate analog signals into stochastic bitstreams, process the stochastic bitstreams and finally control analog actuators relying only on the information on the stochastic bitstreams. Details on the architectures to accomplish such functionality are presented as well as other stochastic arithmetic units. This paper also presents a small stochastic computing-based autonomous cyberphysical system implemented on a Cyclone IV FPGA to carry out a proof-of-concept.","doi":"10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738716","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733896/7738669/07738716.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"XtokaxtikoX: A stochastic computing-based autonomous cyber-physical system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"XtokaxtikoX: A stochastic computing-based autonomous cyber-physical system","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738716/","accessionNumber":"16450535","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"XtokaxtikoX: A stochastic computing-based autonomous cyber-physical system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079007S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7733896","isNumber":"7738669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7733896","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7738669","articleId":"7738716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7738731,"authors":[{"name":"Jaros\u0142aw Jajczyk","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Jaros\u0142aw","lastName":"Jajczyk","id":"37085901542"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2800-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2801-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738731","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738731","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Computers","Genetic algorithms","Conductors","Multicore processing","Insulation","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","mathematics computing","microcomputers","multiprocessing systems","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal computer","multicore processor","optimization","genetic algorithm","busduct","parallel computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optimisation","genetic algorithm","parallel computing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CPEE.2016.7738731","pdfPath":"/iel7/7733773/7738718/07738731.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 17th International Conference Computational Problems of Electrical Engineering (CPEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 17th International Conference Computational Problems of Electrical Engineering (CPEE)","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPEE.2016.7738731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of personal computers with multi-core processors for optimisation using the genetic algorithm method","abstract":"In the study the possibilities of using personal computers equipped with multi-core processors for optimisation calculations of complex technical objects were analysed.

This progress is attributed to the shift from designing features and subsequent individual sub-systems towards learning features and recognition systems end to end from nearly unprocessed data. For speaker clustering, however, it is still common to use handcrafted processing chains such as MFCC features and GMM-based models. In this paper, we use simple spectrograms as input to a CNN and study the optimal design of those networks for speaker identification and clustering. Furthermore, we elaborate on the question how to transfer a network, trained for speaker identification, to speaker clustering. We demonstrate our approach on the well known TIMIT dataset, achieving results comparable with the state of the art-without the need for handcrafted features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449884","htmlLink":"/document/7738816/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speaker identification and clustering using convolutional neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker identification and clustering using convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"final109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073318S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605057","isNumber":"7738802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605057","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7738802","articleId":"7738816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738817,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Vesperini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Vesperini","id":"37085507716"},{"name":"Paolo Vecchiotti","affiliation":["Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Marche, IT"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Vecchiotti"},{"name":"Emanuele Principi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Principi","id":"37429920600"},{"name":"Stefano Squartini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Squartini","id":"37269339100"},{"name":"Francesco Piazza","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Piazza","id":"37269338600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0746-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0747-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738817","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":862},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738817","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Neural networks","Signal processing algorithms","Microphone arrays","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","mean square error methods","microphones","neural nets","optimisation","speaker recognition","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","speaker localization","multiroom environment","multiroom domestic scenarios","GCC-PHAT patterns","generalized cross correlation phase transform patterns","acoustic scene","DIRHA dataset","wall microphone signals","ceiling microphone signals","Oracle multiroom voice activity detector","VAD","optimization","time difference of arrival","TDOA","RMSE"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738817","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605057/7738802/07738817.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network based algorithm for speaker localization in a multi-room environment","abstract":"A Speaker Localization algorithm based on Neural Networks for multi-room domestic scenarios is proposed in this paper. The approach is fully data-driven and employs a Neural Network fed by GCC-PHAT (Generalized Cross Correlation Phase Transform) Patterns, calculated by means of the microphone signals, to determine the speaker position in the room under analysis. In particular, we deal with a multi-room case study, in which the acoustic scene of each room is influenced by sounds emitted in the other rooms. The algorithm is tested against the home recorded DIRHA dataset, characterized by multiple wall and ceiling microphone signals for each room. In particular, we focused on the speaker localization problem in two distinct neighbouring rooms. We assumed the presence of an Oracle multi-room Voice Activity Detector (VAD) in our experiments. A three-stage optimization procedure has been adopted to find the best network configuration and GCC-PHAT Patterns combination. Moreover, an algorithm based on Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), recently proposed in literature for the addressed applicative context, has been considered as term of comparison. As result, the proposed algorithm outperforms the reference one, providing an average localization error, expressed in terms of RMSE, equal to 525 mm against 1465 mm. Concluding, we also assessed the algorithm performance when a real VAD, recently proposed by some of the authors, is used. Even though a degradation of localization capability is registered (an average RMSE equal to 770 mm), still a remarkable improvement with respect to the state of the art performance is obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738817/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16449827","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738817/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A neural network based algorithm for speaker localization in a multi-room environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based algorithm for speaker localization in a multi-room environment","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"final110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081067S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605057","isNumber":"7738802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605057","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7738802","articleId":"7738817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7738824,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Antoniades","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Antoniades","id":"37085897727"},{"name":"Loukianos Spyrou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Loukianos","lastName":"Spyrou","id":"37424571700"},{"name":"Clive Cheong Took","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Clive Cheong","lastName":"Took","id":"37392028300"},{"name":"Saeid Sanei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Sanei","id":"37285025800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0746-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0747-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738824","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1639},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738824","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Convolution","Machine learning","Kernel","Brain modeling","Neural networks","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning","electroencephalography data","EEG data","interictal epileptic discharge detection","IED detection","feature representation","optimal classification performance","automatic feature generation","convolutional neural networks","CNNs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EEG","Deep Learning","Epilepsy","Convolutional Neural Networks"]}],"abstract":"Detection algorithms for electroencephalography (EEG) data typically employ handcrafted features that take advantage of the signal's specific properties. In the field of interictal epileptic discharge (IED) detection, the feature representation that provides optimal classification performance is still an unresolved issue. In this paper, we consider deep learning for automatic feature generation from epileptic intracranial EEG data in the time domain. Specifically, we consider convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a subject independent fashion and demonstrate that meaningful features, representing IEDs are automatically learned. The resulting model achieves state of the art classification performance, provides insights for the different types of IEDs within the group, and is invariant to time differences between the IEDs. This study suggests that automatic feature generation via deep learning is suitable for IEDs and EEG in general.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738824","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605057/7738802/07738824.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning for epileptic intracranial EEG data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning for epileptic intracranial EEG data","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7738824/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449858","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738824/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning for epileptic intracranial EEG data","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"final127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07868S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605057","isNumber":"7738802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605057","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7738802","articleId":"7738824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7738830,"authors":[{"name":"Steffen Limmer","affiliation":["Network Information Theory Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Limmer","id":"37887300100"},{"name":"Slawomir Stanczak","affiliation":["Network Information Theory Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin","Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Slawomir","lastName":"Stanczak","id":"37300829200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0746-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0747-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738830","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayes methods","Estimation","Probabilistic logic","Stochastic processes","Hardware","Standards","Higher order statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","compressed sensing","higher order statistics","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","mean square error methods","neural nets","nonlinear estimation","optimisation","stochastic processes","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","convex optimization","iterative method","nonlinear mappings","linear operators","neural networks","LUTs","look-up tables","linear estimator","MSE","Bayesian mean square error","lp-balls","sparse stochastic signals","probabilistic approach","machine learning","higher-order statistics","sparse recovery","optimal nonlinearities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Probabilistic geometry","lp-balls","compressive sensing","nonlinear estimation","Bayesian MMSE"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards optimal nonlinearities for sparse recovery using higher-order statistics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738830","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738830","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605057/7738802/07738830.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738802","abstract":"We consider machine learning techniques to develop low-latency approximate solutions for a class of inverse problems.

By construction, the complexity of the proposed nonlinear estimator is comparable to that of its linear counterpart since the nonlinear mapping can be implemented efficiently in hardware by means of look-up tables (LUTs). The proposed structure lends itself to neural networks and iterative shrinkage/thresholding-type algorithms restricted to a single iteration (e.g. due to imposed hardware or latency constraints). By resorting to an alternating minimization technique, we obtain a sequence of optimized linear operators and nonlinear mappings that converge in the MSE objective. The result is attractive for real-time applications where general iterative and convex optimization methods are infeasible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738830/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738830/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449820","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Towards optimal nonlinearities for sparse recovery using higher-order statistics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards optimal nonlinearities for sparse recovery using higher-order statistics","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"final136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079352S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605057","isNumber":"7738802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605057","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7738802","articleId":"7738830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7738832,"authors":[{"name":"Oren Barkan","affiliation":["Tel Aviv University"],"firstName":"Oren","lastName":"Barkan","id":"38469686400"},{"name":"Jonathan Weill","affiliation":["Tel Aviv University"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Weill","id":"37075963700"},{"name":"Amir Averbuch","affiliation":["Tel Aviv University"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Averbuch","id":"37268904600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0746-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0747-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738832","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"abstract":"Manifold learning methods are useful for high dimensional data analysis. Many of the existing methods produce a low dimensional representation that attempts to describe the intrinsic geometric structure of the original data. Typically, this process is computationally expensive and the produced embedding is limited to the training data. In many real life scenarios, the ability to produce embedding of unseen samples is essential. In this paper we propose a Bayesian non-parametric approach for out-of-sample extension. The method is based on Gaussian Process Regression and independent of the manifold learning algorithm. Additionally, the method naturally provides a measure for the degree of abnormality for a newly arrived data point that did not participate in the training process. We derive the mathematical connection between the proposed method and the Nystrom extension and show that the latter is a special case of the former. We present extensive experimental results that demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare it to other existing out-of-sample extension methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manifolds","Ground penetrating radar","Training","Kernel","Training data","Gaussian processes","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","data analysis","data structures","Gaussian processes","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian process regression","out-of-sample extension","manifold learning methods","high dimensional data analysis","low dimensional representation","intrinsic geometric structure","Bayesian nonparametric approach","manifold learning algorithm","training process","mathematical connection","Nystrom extension"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738832","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605057/7738802/07738832.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian process regression for out-of-sample extension","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian process regression for out-of-sample extension","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738832/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738832/","accessionNumber":"16449886","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian process regression for out-of-sample extension","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"final14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057165S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605057","isNumber":"7738802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605057","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7738802","articleId":"7738832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7738835,"authors":[{"name":"Pavel Merinov","affiliation":["Institute for Information Transmission Problems (Kharkevich Institute), Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Merinov","id":"37085649944"},{"name":"Mikhail Belyaev","affiliation":["Institute for Information Transmission Problems (Kharkevich Institute), Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Belyaev","id":"37085652971"},{"name":"Egor Krivov","affiliation":["Institute for Information Transmission Problems (Kharkevich Institute), Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Egor","lastName":"Krivov","id":"37085653608"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0746-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0747-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738835","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Optimization","Feature extraction","Band-pass filters","Brain modeling","Neural networks","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","filtering theory","medical signal processing","neural nets","optimisation","parameter estimation","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filter bank extension","neural network","motor imagery classification","common spatial pattern algorithm","feature generation method","linear discriminant analysis classifier","CSP parameter estimation","classification accuracy","filter bank CSP algorithm","linear classifier","single optimization problem","FBCSP-like model","EEG"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738835","abstract":"One of the most successful Motor Imagery classification methods is the Common Spatial Pattern algorithm, which is used as a feature generation method, combined with the Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier.

Many modifications of CSP were proposed, but almost all of them just adjust an objective function in an optimization problem. Another extension is the Filter Bank CSP algorithm, which combines CSP features calculated in different frequency bands. So, parameters of such classification pipelines are estimated in two steps: 1) solving an optimization problem to generate features and 2) create a linear classifier based on these features.

A relative gain of 46.85% is achieved in recognising the Accents of British Isles corpus by applying a baseline DNN model rather than a Gaussian mixture model. However, even for powerful DNN based systems accents remain a challenge. Our study shows that for a `difficult' accent such as Glaswegian the relative word error rate is 78.9% higher than that of the standard southern English accent. In this work we propose four multi-accent learning strategies, and evaluate their effectiveness within the context of DNN based acoustic modelling framework. Using an i-vector based accent identification system with 78% accuracy to label the training data. We present a novel study on the effect of increase in the accent diversity, the `difficulty' and the amount of supplemented training data on the ASR performance. On average a further ASR gain of 27.24 % is achieved using the proposed strategies. Our results show that across all accent regions supplementing the training set with a small amount of data from the most `difficult' accent (2.25 hours of Glaswegian accent) leads to a similar gain in performance as using a large amount of accent diverse data (8.96 hours from 14 accent regions). Although the ideas presented are focused on DNN based analysis with limited amount of multi-accented data, they are applicable for training all classifiers with multi-conditional limited resources.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738854","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605057/7738802/07738854.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving speech recognition using limited accent diverse British English training data with deep neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738854/","displayDocTitle":"Improving speech recognition using limited accent diverse British English training data with deep neural networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738854/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449807","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving speech recognition using limited accent diverse British English training data with deep neural networks","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"final168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084502S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605057","isNumber":"7738802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605057","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7738802","articleId":"7738854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738862,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Tyagi","affiliation":["TCS Research, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Tyagi","id":"37284897600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0746-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0747-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7738862","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid context dependent CD-DNN-HMM Keyword Spotting (KWS) in speech conversations","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605057/7738802/07738862.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738802","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738862","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech","Context","Speech recognition","Training","Lattices","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","mixture models","neural nets","speech coding","speech recognition","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid context dependent CD-DNN-HMM acoustic model","keyword spotting","speech conversations","phoneme recognition performance","context dependent tied-state triphone","Gaussian mixture model","hidden Markov model","context dependent deep neural network","WSJ speech corpus","bigram phoneme language model","Viterbi decoding","KWS architecture","false alarm rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech Recognition","Deep Neural Networks","Keyword Spotting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738862","abstract":"We present detailed analysis of phoneme recognition performance of a context dependent tied-state triphone Gaussian Mixture Model Hidden Markov Model (CD-GMM-HMM) acoustic model (state-of-the-art large acoustic model (AM)) and a four hidden layer context dependent Deep Neural Network (CD-DNN-HMM) AM on the WSJ speech corpus.

In this work, we leverage this interpretation and draw from recent results in the field of online adaptation to derive new tight performance expressions for empirical implementations of stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, and importance sampling. The expressions are exact to first order in the step-size parameter and are tighter than existing bounds.

The outline of the method is as follows: first a low dimensional representation of the original data is learnt. Then, a robust density mixture model is estimated in the learnt space. Finally, the likelihood of a data point given the model parameters is used to apply anomaly detection. An efficient way for adapting the model parameters when the data distribution is changing with time is proposed. We further show how to identify the actual parameters in the original feature space that accounts for the occurrence of the anomaly. We present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605057/7738802/07738885.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust mixture models for anomaly detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Mixture models","Data models","Adaptation models","Estimation","Parameter estimation","Manifolds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","mixture models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","robust density estimation","low dimensional space","low dimensional representation","robust density mixture models","data point","data distribution","feature space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Robust mixture models for anomaly detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738885/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449850","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust mixture models for anomaly detection","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"final60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102753S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605057","isNumber":"7738802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605057","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7738802","articleId":"7738885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738887,"authors":[{"name":"Martino Uccellari","affiliation":["Dept. of Eng.

The framework builds on a distributed convexification technique, while leveraging dynamic consensus to propagate the information over the network. It can be customized to work with different loss and regularization functions, typically used when training NN models, while guaranteeing provable convergence to a stationary solution under mild assumptions. Interestingly, it naturally leads to distributed architectures where agents solve local optimization problems exploiting parallel multi-core processors.

Traditionally, an eGFR time series is interpreted by a human expert labelling it as stable or unstable. While this approach works for individual patients, the time consuming nature of it precludes the quick evaluation of risk in large numbers of patients. However, automating this process poses significant challenges as eGFR measurements are usually recorded at irregular intervals and the series of measurements differs in length between patients. Here we present a two-tier system to automatically classify an eGFR trend. First, we model the time series using Gaussian process regression (GPR) to fill in `gaps' by resampling a fixed size vector of fifty time-dependent observations. Second, we classify the resampled eGFR time series using a K-NN/SVM classifier, and evaluate its performance via 5-fold cross validation. Using this approach we achieved an F-score of 0.90, compared to 0.96 for 5 human experts when scored amongst themselves.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Market research","Ground penetrating radar","Gaussian processes","Standards","Diseases","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","Gaussian processes","kidney","medical computing","pattern classification","regression analysis","support vector machines","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patient estimated glomerular filtration rate","disease progression","kidney function","human expert labelling","eGFR measurements","two-tier system","Gaussian process regression","GPR","fixed size vector resampling","fifty time-dependent observations","K-NN-SVM classifier","irregularly sampled time series","automatic classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["eGFR","Gaussian Process Regression","K-NN","SVM","CKD","AKI"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738901","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605057/7738802/07738901.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic classification of irregularly sampled time series with unequal lengths: A case study on estimated glomerular filtration rate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic classification of irregularly sampled time series with unequal lengths: A case study on estimated glomerular filtration rate","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738901/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738901/","accessionNumber":"16462090","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic classification of irregularly sampled time series with unequal lengths: A case study on estimated glomerular filtration rate","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"final83.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048442S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605057","isNumber":"7738802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605057","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7738802","articleId":"7738901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738952,"authors":[{"name":"Anindya Mukherjee","affiliation":["CEDIC Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Anindya","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"38024191000"},{"name":"Chenye Lin","affiliation":["CEDIC Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Chenye","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085891722"},{"name":"Michael Schr\u00f6ter","affiliation":["ECE Department, UC San Diego, La Jolla, USA","CEDIC Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Schr\u00f6ter","id":"37284000500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0484-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0483-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0485-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-590X"}],"articleNumber":"7738952","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"abstract":"Benchmark circuit are small circuit blocks that resemble the major features of the active and passive devices for a given process technology.

The former transceiver achieves a higher transmit output power as well as receive gain and is meant for applications requiring a high dynamic range, while the latter transceiver allows a higher modulation bandwidth and is meant for high resolution applications. The transceivers include a frequency multiplier that generates the 61 and 122 GHz carrier signals from a single external 30.5 GHz LO signal that is also fed to an output buffer in the transceivers. The proposed architecture enables the cascading of multiple transceivers and allows thus the implementation of a MIMO radar system with 2 different frequency bands. The transceivers are equipped with BPSK modulators as well as an I/Q receiver and can be utilized as a base to build a very flexible software-defined radar platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting (BCTM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731987/7738940/07738954.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"173","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting (BCTM)","doi":"10.1109/BCTM.2016.7738954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BCTM.2016.7738954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738940","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7738954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable sensor platform with multi-purpose fully-differential 61 and 122 GHz transceivers for MIMO radar applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Electronic mail","Radar","Mixers","Frequency synthesizers","Signal generators","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","frequency multipliers","Ge-Si alloys","millimetre wave detectors","millimetre wave frequency convertors","MIMO radar","semiconductor materials","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable sensor platform","multipurpose fully-differential transceivers","silicon-germanium BiCMOS technology","transmit output power","receive gain","modulation bandwidth","frequency multiplier","output buffer","LO signal","multiple transceivers","MIMO radar system","BPSK modulators","I/Q receiver","software-defined radar platform","frequency 61 GHz","frequency 122 GHz","frequency 30.5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radar","transceiver","silicon-germanium technology","scalable MIMO radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7738954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Scalable sensor platform with multi-purpose fully-differential 61 and 122 GHz transceivers for MIMO radar applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7738954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16463805","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable sensor platform with multi-purpose fully-differential 61 and 122 GHz transceivers for MIMO radar applications","confLoc":"New Brunswick, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"0789-000023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060075S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731987","isNumber":"7738940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731987","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7738940","articleId":"7738954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7738957,"authors":[{"name":"Guido Belfiore","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Belfiore","id":"37078512400"},{"name":"Ronny Henker","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Ronny","lastName":"Henker","id":"37319651000"},{"name":"Frank Ellinger","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen, DE"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Ellinger"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0484-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0483-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0485-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-590X"}],"articleNumber":"7738957","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":518},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Adders","Bit error rate","Oscilloscopes","Extraterrestrial measurements","Cathodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","driver circuits","equalisers","integrated optics","optical communication","surface emitting lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strong equalization effect","high-speed VCSEL-based optical communications","VCSEL driver design","BiCMOS technology","bandwidth extension techniques","electrical data-rate","optical eye diagram","common-cathode VCSEL driver","energy-efficiency","output voltage swing","resistance 50 ohm","size 130 nm","frequency 20 GHz","power 188 mW","voltage 2.5 V","voltage 3.4 V","SiGe"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the design of a VCSEL driver with strong equalization is presented.

The driver is designed in 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. Thanks to the various bandwidth extension techniques, the electrical data-rate at which the driver can operate is higher than 50 Gbit/s. A wide open optical eye diagram is measured at 48 Gbit/s with a 20 GHz VCSEL. The driver and the VCSEL consume only 188 mW from a dual voltage supply of 2.5 and 3.4 V. To the best of the authors knowledge 3.9 mW/(Gbit/s) is the highest reported energy-efficiency for a common-cathode VCSEL driver with data-rate higher than 40 Gbit/s. Moreover an open eye at 48 Gbit/s is the fastest reported for a common cathode VCSEL driver without pre-emphasis in the receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of strong equalization in

In this paper, we studied the validity of the Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of the EMI filter for predicting the shielding performance before a trial manufacture. First, we created models of capacitors and common mode choke coils which can simulate their impedance characteristics. Next, using these component models, the assembled EMI filter model was created. We compared the measured and simulated results to verify the model. The shielding performance was evaluated using a loop coil as an external near field source. Consequently, the simulated results agreed with the measured results well.","doi":"10.1109/EMCEurope.2016.7739152","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility - EMC EUROPE","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility - EMC EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel7/7602833/7739138/07739152.pdf","startPage":"716","endPage":"721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMCEurope.2016.7739152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of shielding performance against near field coupling to EMI filter for power electronic converter using FEM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7739152","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7739152/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of shielding performance against near field coupling to EMI filter for power electronic converter using FEM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449326","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7739152/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of shielding performance against near field coupling to EMI filter for power electronic converter using FEM","confLoc":"Wroclaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"EMC201600105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091912S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7602833","isNumber":"7739138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602833","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7739138","articleId":"7739152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7739161,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaotian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York"],"firstName":"Xiaotian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085693325"},{"name":"Martin P.

The averaged ACS is very important in many EMC research areas such as indoor wireless channel modelling and human safety exposure study. The measurement of averaged ACS in a reverberation chamber can be achieved by measuring the rate of power loss in the time domain, however this technique requires dense frequency sampling for taking the inverse Fourier transform, which is very time consuming. A new scenario which accelerates the measurement speed is presented in this paper. It combines the technique of non-linear curve fitting to the power delay profile, segmented frequency sweeping and continuous mode stirring. The scenario was validated by measuring the averaged ACS of a hollow plastic sphere filled with deionized water in an EMC reverberation chamber.

Both amplitude and phase of the FDTD calculation are simultaneously calculated and traced for evaluation of the convergence and for decision of terminating the computation. Validity of the approach has been demonstrated via numerical dosimetry of a homogeneous dielectric sphere in comparison with Mie's analytical results. Induced SAR in a dielectric sphere calculated by using the proposed approach are in good agreement with Mie's results, having differences in the whole-body average SAR for less than 4% at 1 MHz. It has been also demonstrated that the proposed technique is efficient and generally applicable to numerical dosimetry in which only the solution is needed to be determined at a single frequency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility - EMC EUROPE","pdfPath":"/iel7/7602833/7739138/07739232.pdf","startPage":"807","endPage":"811","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility - EMC EUROPE","doi":"10.1109/EMCEurope.2016.7739232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMCEurope.2016.7739232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7739232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel FDTD approach for numerical dosimetry at a single frequency","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Convergence","Dielectrics","Dosimetry","Electric fields","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dosimetry","finite difference time-domain analysis","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD approach","numerical dosimetry","time-series convergence","finite-difference time-domain","homogeneous dielectric sphere"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain method","single frequency","numerical dosimetry","steady-state analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7739232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel FDTD approach for numerical dosimetry at a single frequency","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7739232/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16449406","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel FDTD approach for numerical dosimetry at a single frequency","confLoc":"Wroclaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"EMC201600219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085782S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7602833","isNumber":"7739138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602833","xplore-issue":"7739138","articleId":"7739232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7739239,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Audone","affiliation":["EMC Consultant, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Audone","id":"37349451200"},{"name":"Roberto Colombo","affiliation":["IMQ S.p.A., Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Colombo","id":"38228029400"},{"name":"Ilario Marziali","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Ilario","lastName":"Marziali","id":"38108796200"},{"name":"Onofrio Losito","affiliation":["ITEL Telecomunicazioni S.r.l., Ruvo di Puglia (BA), Italy"],"firstName":"Onofrio","lastName":"Losito","id":"37318707700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1416-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1415-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1417-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0364"}],"articleNumber":"7739239","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"abstract":"Spectrograms are useful diagnostic tools because they allow to improve our understanding of unwanted transient disturbances and in general of the so called sophisticated signals which include frequency-modulated pulses, coded groups, phase-modulated signals, etc. Unlike the limits specified by EMC standards which usually make reference to graphs of amplitude versus time or amplitude versus frequency, spectrograms allow users to analyze the behavior of disturbance signals in the time and frequency domains in the same diagram with the advantage of improving our knowledge of interference sources.

Different types of DC Circuit Breakers (DCCBs) assisted with arrester banks/damping resistors such as solid-state CBs and hybrid DCCBs can be used to interrupt the DC fault current. Arrester banks are used to block any overvoltage after interrupting the fault current and in turn to demagnetize the circuit inductors. The main disadvantage of the arresters is that they forcibly break apart when they are overloaded. In this work, an arrester-less DC fault current limiter is proposed for HBMMC configuration. The proposed DC fault current limiter has two pre-charged capacitors in series with transmission poles. These pre-charged capacitors are bypassed during normal conditions, while they are inserted in the DC current path during DC side fault to limit the grid current contribution into the dc fault. The proposed protection scheme is assessed using a simulation study.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Half-bridge modular multilevel-based HVDC converters with external pre-charged capacitors for dc fault current suppression capability","doi":"10.1049/cp.2016.0186","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2016.0186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7475410","publicationTitle":"8th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2016)","displayPublicationTitle":"8th IET International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2016)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7475409/7475410/07739374.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7739374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7739374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"Half-bridge modular multilevel-based HVDC converters with external pre-charged capacitors for dc fault current suppression capability","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15970167","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Half-bridge modular multilevel-based HVDC converters with external pre-charged capacitors for dc fault current suppression capability","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"20160186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029337S","chronDate":"19-21 April 2016","isNumber":"7475410","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7475409","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7739374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7739445,"authors":[{"name":"T Feehally","affiliation":["The University of Manchester, Manchester, Manchester, GB"],"firstName":"T","lastName":"Feehally"},{"name":"A J Forsyth","affiliation":["The University of Manchester, Manchester, Manchester, GB"],"firstName":"A J","lastName":"Forsyth"},{"name":"R Todd","affiliation":["The University of Manchester, Manchester, Manchester, GB"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Todd"},{"name":"M P Foster","affiliation":["The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, Sheffield, GB"],"firstName":"M P","lastName":"Foster"},{"name":"D Gladwin","affiliation":["The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, Sheffield, GB"],"firstName":"D","lastName":"Gladwin"},{"name":"D A Stone","affiliation":["The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, Sheffield, GB"],"firstName":"D","lastName":"A Stone"},{"name":"D Strickland","affiliation":["Aston University, Birmingham, Birmingham, GB"],"firstName":"D","lastName":"Strickland"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-188-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-78561-189-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7739445","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery storage plants","distribution networks","power grids","power system stability","renewable energy sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution network","University of Sheffield","University of Manchester","grid support service","UK electricity grid","renewable generation penetration","power network stability improvement","grid-connected battery energy storage system","UK research facility","voltage 400 V","voltage 11 kV","apparent power 236 kVA","apparent power 2 MVA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["grid-scale","battery","energy storage","hardware"]}],"abstract":"Grid-connected battery energy storage systems with fast acting control are a key technology for improving power network stability and increasing the penetration of renewable generation.

First, it facilitates bottom-up analysis, i.e., the detection of trends and patterns whose shapes are not known beforehand. Second, it integrates data mining algorithms to explain such patterns in terms of the time series' metadata attributes - an extremely difficult task if the space of attribute-value combinations is large. To accomplish these aims, Gatherminer automatically rearranges the data to visually expose patterns and clusters, whereupon users can select those groups they deem `interesting.'

Initially, a team of robots is moving in pre-defined formation configuration. When actuator faults occur in one or more robots, and the faulty robot(s) cannot complete the mission, the rest of robots start reconfiguring the formation to compensate the fault effect on the whole mission. First, the new formation reconfiguration is generated by solving an optimal assignment problem where each healthy robot should be assigned to a unique place. Then, the new formation can be reconfigured by recasting the reconfiguration problem as an optimization problem, while the objective is to minimize the time to achieve the new formation reconfiguration within the constraints of the robots' dynamics and collision avoidance. A hybrid approach of control parametrization and time discretization (CPTD) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to solve the optimization problem. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SYSTOL.2016.7739723","startPage":"21","endPage":"26","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems (SysTol)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYSTOL.2016.7739723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739711","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems (SysTol)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7602795/7739711/07739723.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant cooperative control of WMRs under actuator faults based on particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7739723/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant cooperative control of WMRs under actuator faults based on particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7739723/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16449188","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant cooperative control of WMRs under actuator faults based on particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0004WeA204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073264S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7602795","isNumber":"7739711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602795","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7739711","articleId":"7739723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7739729,"authors":[{"name":"Irfan Jaband\u017ei\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Irfan","lastName":"Jaband\u017ei\u0107","id":"37085895159"},{"name":"Jasmin Velagi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Jasmin","lastName":"Velagi\u0107","id":"37426260600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0658-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0657-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1209"}],"articleNumber":"7739729","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Navigation","Robot sensing systems","Robot kinematics","Standards","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","collision avoidance","mobile robots","navigation","particle swarm optimisation","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","unstructured static environments","time-varying environments","mobile robot navigation","PSO","fitness function","subfunctions","robot obstacle","robot position","local minima problem avoidance","obstacles detection","collision free path","adaptive control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7739729","abstract":"The paper considers a problem of the mobile robot navigation in unstructured environments based on an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. It introduces a new fitness function divided into sub-functions, where each sub-function is responsible for accomplishing given objectives and imposed constraints. The main objectives of proposed sub-functions are to maximize the distance between the robot and a previously detected nearest obstacle, minimize distance from the robot to a global best position of the particles and the local minima problem avoidance. Also, proper constraints are included to prevent the robot from penetrating into restricted (prohibited) areas around detected obstacles or to avoid that particle moves too far away from the mobile robot's current position. The proposed PSO based planner generates a smooth collision free path with a low computational cost and approaches the goal position employing an adaptive control strategy. The adjustment and selection of suitable parameters values of PSO method are based on extensive simulations performed in various environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified with a series of simulations.","doi":"10.1109/SYSTOL.2016.7739729","startPage":"59","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems (SysTol)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYSTOL.2016.7739729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739711","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems (SysTol)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7602795/7739711/07739729.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization-based method for navigation of mobile robot in unstructured static and time-varying environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7739729/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization-based method for navigation of mobile robot in unstructured static and time-varying environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7739729/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16449164","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization-based method for navigation of mobile robot in unstructured static and time-varying environments","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0010WeA305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068993S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7602795","isNumber":"7739711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602795","xplore-issue":"7739711","articleId":"7739729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7739747,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Jung","id":"37085460878"},{"name":"Kok Yew Ng","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kok Yew","lastName":"Ng","id":"37963320700"},{"name":"Erik Frisk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Frisk","id":"37658903000"},{"name":"Mattias Krysander","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mattias","lastName":"Krysander","id":"37658897900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0658-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0657-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1209"}],"articleNumber":"7739747","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Training data","System analysis and design","Fault diagnosis","Data models","Atmospheric modeling","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","control system synthesis","fault diagnosis","internal combustion engines","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined diagnosis system design","model-based methods","data-driven methods","hybrid diagnosis system design","fault isolation","support vector machines","air-flow","internal combustion engine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7739747","abstract":"A hybrid diagnosis system design is proposed that combines model-based and data-driven diagnosis methods for fault isolation.

The final part of the paper shows an illustrative example concerning an application of the proposed approach to a multi-tank system benchmark.","doi":"10.1109/SYSTOL.2016.7739767","pdfPath":"/iel7/7602795/7739711/07739767.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"304","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems (SysTol)","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems (SysTol)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYSTOL.2016.7739767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network-based simultaneous state and actuator fault estimation under unknown input decoupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7739767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A neural network-based simultaneous state and actuator fault estimation under unknown input decoupling","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16449280","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7739767/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network-based simultaneous state and actuator fault estimation under unknown input decoupling","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0048WeC404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081034S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7602795","isNumber":"7739711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602795","xplore-issue":"7739711","articleId":"7739767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7739890,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Xu","affiliation":["Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, CN"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Shengxian Zhuang","affiliation":["Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, CN"],"firstName":"Shengxian","lastName":"Zhuang"},{"name":"Yingfeng Zeng","affiliation":["Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, CN"],"firstName":"Yingfeng","lastName":"Zeng"},{"name":"Jian Xiao","affiliation":["Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, CN"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Xiao"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-9266"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-9274"}],"articleNumber":"7739890","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":510},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7739890","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Artificial neural networks","Couplings","Complex networks","Adaptive systems","Laplace equations","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","complex networks","decentralised control","Laplace transforms","Lyapunov methods","mathematical programming","network theory (graphs)","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional-order complex network synchronization","fractional order complex dynamical networks","decentralized adaptive coupling","fractional order decentralized adaptive strategies","quadratic Lyapunov functions","fractional inequality techniques","Mittag-Leffler function","Laplace transform"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JAS.2016.7510142","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570654/7974885/07739890.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","startPage":"543","endPage":"550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JAS.2016.7510142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized adaptive strategies for synchronization of fractional-order complex networks","abstract":"This paper focuses on synchronization of fractional order complex dynamical networks with decentralized adaptive coupling.

To estimate x\u0302, a typical method is to solve a box-constrained integer least squares problem. However, due to its high complexity, the box-constrained Babai integer point x\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BB</sup>\n is commonly used as a suboptimal solution. In this paper, we first derive formulas for the success probability P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BB</sup>\n of x\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BB</sup>\n and the success probability POB of the ordinary Babai integer point x\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OB</sup>\n when x\u0302 is uniformly distributed over the constraint box. Some properties of P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BB</sup>\n and P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OB</sup>\n and the relationship between them are studied. Then, we investigate the effects of some column permutation strategies on P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BB</sup>\n. In addition to V-BLAST and SQRD, we also consider the permutation strategy involved in the LLL lattice reduction, to be referred to as LLL-P. On the one hand, we show that when the noise is relatively small, LLL-P always increases P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BB</sup>\n and argue why both V-BLAST and SQRD often increase P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BB</sup>\n; and on the other hand, we show that when the noise is relatively large, LLL-P always decreases P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BB</sup>\n and argue why both V-BLAST and SQRD often decrease PBB.

Numerical results demonstrate our findings. Finally, we consider a conjecture concerning x\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OB</sup>\n proposed by Ma et al.

Here, we provide the analytical Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) on the target location for a planar HMPAR. Fixing the total number of T/R elements, we create two scenarios, in order to compare the CRLB values of different HMPAR configurations to the MIMO CRLB.

We assume two scenarios for the battery of the EH source. In the first scenario, we assume that the EH source is not equipped with a battery and thereby cannot store energy. As a result, the RF energy harvested during one symbol interval can only be used in the following symbol interval. In the second scenario, we assume that the EH source is equipped with a battery having unlimited storage capacity in which it can store the harvested RF energy. As a result, the RF energy harvested during one symbol interval can be used in any of the following symbol intervals. For both system models, we derive the channel capacity subject to an average power constraint at the relay and an additional energy transmission cost at the EH source. We compare the derived capacities to the achievable rates of several benchmark schemes. Our results show that using the optimal input distributions at both the EH source and the relay is essential for high performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that neglecting the energy transmission cost at the source can result in a severe overestimation of the achievable performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07739988.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2627047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2627047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7739988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of the Two-Hop Relay Channel With Wireless Energy Transfer From Relay to Source and Energy Transmission Cost","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Batteries","Wireless communication","Radio frequency","AWGN channels","Channel models","Energy exchange"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","energy harvesting","error statistics","radiofrequency power transmission","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-hop relay channel","wireless energy transfer","energy transmission cost","energy harvesting source","radio frequency energy","out-of-band full-duplex relay node","destination node","symbol interval","channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel capacity","relay","wireless energy transfer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7739988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of the Two-Hop Relay Channel With Wireless Energy Transfer From Relay to Source and Energy Transmission Cost","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7739988/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618468","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Linkage Project","grantNumber":"LP160100708"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of the Two-Hop Relay Channel With Wireless Energy Transfer From Relay to Source and Energy Transmission Cost","sourcePdf":"twc-zlatanov-2627047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125935S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7739988","onlineDate":"09 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7739990,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Cheng","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Division, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/7879373/7739990/cheng-2621348-small.gif","p":["Xiang Cheng (S\u201915) received his bachelor degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2013.

We find that, in contrast to previous generations of process technologies, total ionizing dose effects can be significant in these devices. For proton irradiation, worst-case bias for transconductance degradation for GaN-on-SiC substrate devices is ON bias, and for devices built on free-standing GaN substrates, the worst-case bias condition is semi-ON bias. Low-frequency noise measurements demonstrate that these differences result from differences in defect types and energy distributions for the different types of devices, both before and after irradiation. These results emphasize the need to test devices under a wide range of conditions during characterization and qualification testing.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2016.2626962","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7869239/07739992.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2016.2626962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7869239","startPage":"218","endPage":"225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Worst-Case Bias for Proton and 10-keV X-Ray Irradiation of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7739992","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/23/7869239/7739992-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Worst-Case Bias for Proton and 10-keV X-Ray Irradiation of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7739992/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16721527","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7739992/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000774","fundingName":"Defense Threat Reduction Agency AFOSR and AFRL through the Hi-REV program","grantNumber":"HDTRA1-11-1-0023"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1508898"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Worst-Case Bias for Proton and 10-keV X-Ray Irradiation of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs","sourcePdf":"tns-jiang-2626962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136651S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7869239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7869239","articleId":"7739992","onlineDate":"09 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7739993,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Rajchl","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, SW7 2AZ, London, U.K"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Rajchl","id":"38233900000"},{"name":"Matthew C.

The steering vector plays an important role in signal reconstruction, which can be constructed by the ambiguity components. The information of the ambiguity components, e.g., number and index, is usually regarded to be constant and known. However, we find that the information of ambiguity components is always a piecewise function of the baseband frequency. This means that the steering vector cannot be preconstructed accurately and it will negatively affect the signal reconstruction. This paper presents an improved signal reconstruction method based on the Doppler spectrum estimation. The proposed method can estimate the variant ambiguity components to form the steering vector exactly by the Capon estimation. As a result, the method is able to restore the Doppler spectrum entirely and performs well on the noise reduction. Moreover, the baseband Doppler centroid and antenna pattern can be obtained in the proposed method. Simulated data and airborne raw data are processed to validate the algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Signal Reconstruction Algorithm for Multichannel SAR Based on the Doppler Spectrum Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2618518","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7885612/07739995.pdf","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2618518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7885612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7739995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7739995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Improved Signal Reconstruction Algorithm for Multichannel SAR Based on the Doppler Spectrum Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7739995/","dateOfInsertion":"23 March 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16773869","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Signal Reconstruction Algorithm for Multichannel SAR Based on the Doppler Spectrum Estimation","sourcePdf":"jstars-sun-2618518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101037S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7885612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7885612","articleId":"7739995","onlineDate":"09 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7739998,"authors":[{"name":"Bangcheng Han","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering","Beijing Engineering Research Center of High-Speed Magnetically Suspended Motor Technology and Application, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7849237/7739998/han-2627021-small.gif","p":["Bangcheng Han (M\u201912) was born in February 1974.

The eight-element chip can be configured for one, two, or four simultaneous beams or as an element-level DBF receiver. This is achieved using reconfigurable input switching and output combining networks with wideband active switches and combiners. The phased array channel results in a 5-b performance at 3-14 GHz (rms error <;5\u00b0) and a 4-b performance at 2-16 GHz (rms error <;8.5\u00b0). Each channel also contains a 3-b variable gain amplifier with 8-dB gain control at 2-16 GHz. The chip results in an 8-12-dB gain at 2-16 GHz (depending on the PPA mode), a noise figure (NF) of 12 dB, and an input P1 dB of -20 dBm per channel when all channels are activated. The chip consumes 250 mW per channel, which is competitive knowing its bandwidth and linearity. The DBF function also results in a wideband response with a gain and an NF of 15-16 and 12-13 dB, respectively, and high linearity (input P1 dB = -16 dBm) at 2-16 GHz. The programmable phased array receiver allows a single chip to be used over S-, C-, X-, and Ku-bands for a variety of applications such as satellite communications and point-to-point links. This results in faster and lower-cost phased array development since the same chip and its field-programmable gate array control can be reused from system to system, but with different antenna and grid spacing. The PPA removes the need to develop a different chip for every application and allows the development of phased arrays at commercial scales.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7776993/07739999.pdf","startPage":"4585","endPage":"4597","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2620144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2620144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7739999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Eight-Element 2\u201316-GHz Programmable Phased Array Receiver With One, Two, or Four Simultaneous Beams in SiGe BiCMOS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Wideband","Gain","Impedance matching","Ports (Computers)","Receivers","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","array signal processing","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Ge-Si alloys","microwave amplifiers","microwave antenna arrays","power combiners","receiving antennas","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eight-element programmable phased array receiver","simultaneous beams","silicon-germaniun BiCMOS","PPA receiver","reconfigurable beam","digital beamforming capability","DBF capability","eight-element chip","element-level DBF receiver","reconfigurable input switching network","output combining network","wideband active switches","combiners","phased array channel","variable gain amplifier","wideband response","S-band","C-band","X-band","Ku-band","satellite communication","point-to-point links","field-programmable gate array control","frequency 2 GHz to 16 GHz","size 0.13 mum","word length 5 bit","word length 4 bit","word length 3 bit","gain 8 dB to 12 dB","power 250 mW","gain 15 dB to 16 dB","noise figure 12 dB to 13 dB","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital beamforming (DBF)","in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) network","phased arrays","phase shifters (PSs)","reconfigurable beamforming network","satellite communications","SiGe BiCMOS","variable gain amplifier (VGA)","vector modulator","wideband balun"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7739999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"An Eight-Element 2\u201316-GHz Programmable Phased Array Receiver With One, Two, or Four Simultaneous Beams in SiGe BiCMOS","volume":"64","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7739999/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519036","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Eight-Element 2\u201316-GHz Programmable Phased Array Receiver With One, Two, or Four Simultaneous Beams in SiGe BiCMOS","sourcePdf":"tmtt-sayginer-2620144-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089961S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7776993","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7776993","articleId":"7739999","onlineDate":"09 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"}]
