Apart from the improved RAM design, these measures are only viable in an asynchronous design.

The data-driven principle underlying the structure of these processors was realized in a super-pipelined implementation, which was in turn based on a self-timed clocking scheme. This design made it possible to realize single chip DDMPs capable of executing tens of billions of signal processing operations per second with power consumption as low as 2 W. In terms of operations per watt, the processors exhibit threefold to tenfold improvement over conventional sequential digital signal processors (DSPs). The structure of this paper is as follows: 1) a brief introduction to the data-driven processing principle; 2) a detailed description of elementary modules for the realization of self-timed pipeline microprocessors; and 3) a description of the DDMP's developed thus far in the research project, which has continued for more than a decade. Also outlined here are the numerous advantages, in terms of both function and power consumption, of the self-timed pipeline over its synchronous counterparts. Commercially available DSP-oriented asynchronous data-driven processors and their practical applications to consumer appliances such as digital TV receivers are discussed; some programming examples are provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6159666","volume":"87","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DDMPs: self-timed super-pipelined data-driven multimedia processors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DDMPs: self-timed super-pipelined data-driven multimedia processors","sourcePdf":"00740021.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087348S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"15977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"31","articleId":"740021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":740022,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

We demonstrate with fabricated chips that asynchronous circuits can be every bit as fast as clocked circuits. We describe two high-speed first-in-first-out (FIFO) circuits that we used to compare the performance of asynchronous FIFOs with that of conventionally clocked shift registers. The first FIFO circuit uses a pulse-like protocol, which we call the Asynchronous Symmetric Persistent Pulse Protocol (asP*), to advance data along a pipeline of conventional latches. Use of this protocol requires careful management of circuit delays. The second FIFO circuit uses a transition signaling protocol and special transition latches to store data. These transition latches are fast, but they are about 50% larger than conventional latches. Measurements obtained from chips fabricated in 0.6 /spl mu/m CMOS and from SPICE simulations show that the throughput of the first FIFO design matches that of a conventionally clocked shift register design, with a maximum throughput of 1.1 Giga data items per second. The throughput of the second design exceeds the performance of the asP* design and achieves a maximum throughput of 1.7 Giga data items per second. We have extensively tested the chips and have found them to operate reliably over a very wide range of conditions.","doi":"10.1109/5.740022","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel4/5/15977/00740022.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.740022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15977","startPage":"297","endPage":"307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two FIFO ring performance experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740022","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two FIFO ring performance experiments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"87","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6159667","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two FIFO ring performance experiments","sourcePdf":"00740022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047348S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"15977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"33","articleId":"740022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":740031,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The present effort is aimed at exploring the benefits of underfilling in DCA configurations. The thermo-structural behavior of an underfilled DCA is evaluated using FEM and employing an axisymmetric model of a typical DCA structure. Numerical simulations are performed for different sets of underfill material properties. The results are used to determine the parametric sensitivity of the thermal strain in the solder joints and the axial and shear stresses in the underfill material and to define the desirable range of underfill material properties. These results together with the Coffin-Manson relation are used to predict the theoretical improvement in cycles to failure. The results suggest that to minimize fatigue failure, the CTE of an underfill material should match that of solder material and its Young's Modulus should be as high as the adhesion strength of the underfill allows.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740050/","volume":"21","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6156252","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coffin-Manson based fatigue analysis of underfilled DCAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coffin-Manson based fatigue analysis of underfilled DCAs","sourcePdf":"577584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04248S","chronDate":"Dec.  1998","isNumber":"15985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"29","articleId":"740050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":740051,"authors":[{"name":"Cher Ming Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Microelectronic Division, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798"],"firstName":"Cher Ming","lastName":"Tan"},{"name":"Eddie Er","affiliation":["Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd., Singapore Science Park, Singapore"],"firstName":"Eddie","lastName":"Er"},{"name":"Younan Hua","affiliation":["Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd., Singapore Science Park, Singapore"],"firstName":"Younan","lastName":"Hua"},{"name":"Vincent Chai","affiliation":["Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd., Singapore Science Park, Singapore"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Chai"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3678"}],"articleNumber":"740051","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology Society","url":"http://www.cpmt.org/index.html"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740051","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Switches","Length measurement","Cathodes","Silver","Electrons","Gain measurement","Loss measurement","DC motors","Lamps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit-breaking arcs","mass transfer","wear","electrical contacts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anodic to cathodic arc transition","break arc lengthening","switch","relay","mass transfer","contact material erosion","electron mean free path","14 V","20 to 80 A","Ag","AgCu","Cu","AgNi","AgCdO","AgSnO/sub 2/"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AFM","bond pad","EDX","failure analysis","FIB","SEM"]}],"doi":"10.1109/95.740051","endPage":"591","startPage":"585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/15985/00740051.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.740051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure analysis of bond pad metal peeling using FIB and AFM","abstract":"Aluminum bond pads on semiconductor chips play an important role in chips functionality and reliability.

This paper presents a statistical method for analyzing the performance of DS/CDMA cellular radio systems employing RAKE receivers and sectorized antennas. Average bit error rates in the system are estimated considering the multipath fading effects of the environment. (The fast fading is assumed to be Rayleigh distributed, and the distance-dependent means of the multipath components have an exponential power delay profile.) The analysis of RAKE receivers quantifies the performance improvement that could be achieved by increasing the number of RAKE fingers. Sectorized antennas improve the system performance by reducing the interference at the receiver. In a perfectly sectorized system, assuming three sectors per cell, the capacity of the system can be improved by a factor of three. However, due to the imperfection in practical antennas, it is not possible to achieve this improvement. The performance of systems employing practical sectorized antennas (with finite front-to-back ratios and overlapping sectors) is compared with the performance of perfectly sectorized systems. The analysis shows that the incremental performance improvement diminishes with each incremental increase in the number of RAKE fingers. Performance degradation due to finite front-to-back ratio is shown to be insignificant for practical values of the front-to-back ratio of sectorized antennas. However, the reliability of mobile reception can be degraded significantly in areas where adjacent sectors overlap.","doi":"10.1109/25.740056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15982/00740056.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.740056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A statistical approach to the analysis of DS/CDMA cellular systems employing RAKE receivers and sectorized antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740056/","displayDocTitle":"A statistical approach to the analysis of DS/CDMA cellular systems employing RAKE receivers and sectorized antennas","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6158023","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical approach to the analysis of DS/CDMA cellular systems employing RAKE receivers and sectorized antennas","sourcePdf":"00740056.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051782S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"15982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","articleId":"740056","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":740058,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The key feature of this development is the specification of a flexible call admission control procedure that details the numbers of mobiles of each class in each cell that the system operator should allow in order to maintain an acceptable quality of service. Effective bandwidth techniques from the analysis of statistical multiplexing at an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) based broadband integrated services digital network (ISDN) link are used to give performance guarantees that overcome the variability in interference levels characteristic of CDMA cellular networks. The result is an admissible region bounded by a finite number of hyperplanes and a simple and efficient call admission policy. The CDMA mobile network, operating within the admissible region described, has a very similar form to a circuit-switched network operating with fixed routing. This similarity allows the existing traffic modeling techniques and network management strategies for general loss networks to be applied to CDMA mobile cellular networks. In particular, with standard assumptions on the call arrival processes and holding times, the stationary state distribution has a product form on the truncated state space defined by the call admission strategy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15982/00740058.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"46","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.740058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.740058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective bandwidth-based admission control for multiservice CDMA cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admission control","Multiaccess communication","Traffic control","Asynchronous transfer mode","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Communication system traffic control","Call admission control","Quality of service","Bandwidth","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cellular radio","radio networks","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic","quality of service","asynchronous transfer mode","ISDN","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective bandwidth-based admission control","multiservice CDMA cellular networks","product form traffic models","code-division multiple-access","multiple-cell CDMA network","single-cell CDMA networks","mobile subscribers","call admission control","system operator","quality of service","statistical multiplexing","asynchronous transfer mode","ATM","broadband integrated services digital network","ISDN","performance guarantees","interference levels","admissible region","hyperplanes","circuit-switched network","fixed routing","traffic modeling","network management","general loss networks","call arrival processes","call holding times","stationary state distribution","truncated state space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Effective bandwidth-based admission control for multiservice CDMA cellular networks","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6158025","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective bandwidth-based admission control for multiservice CDMA cellular networks","sourcePdf":"00740058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053524S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"15982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"119","articleId":"740058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":740059,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Shyr Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jung-Shyr Wu","id":"37350151300"},{"name":"Jen-Kung Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jen-Kung Chung","id":"37349508500"},{"name":"Yu-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["TL, Chunghwa Telecom, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Chuan Yang","id":"37367393600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"740059","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":105},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740059","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microcell networks","Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Power control","Macrocell networks","Radio frequency","Interference","Area measurement","Capacity planning","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","microcellular radio","radio links","telecommunication control","power control","probability","radiofrequency interference","channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blocking probability","microcell hot spot","CDMA macrocell systems","code-division multiple-access","system capacity","hierarchical layer","system design","radio frequency","RF channels","overlayed/underlayed macrocell","homogeneous structure","interference","uplink","downlink","power control","performance measures","C/I","capacity","service hole area","computer simulation","base station"]}],"abstract":"The code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system can provide more capacity than other systems, and the hierarchical layer of cells is required for system design.

Based on a new dimension partitioning technique, the precoder predistorts only the phase of the transmitted signal to keep a constant transmitted signal amplitude and, therefore, to ensure the stability of the precoder even in equalizing a nonminimum-phase channel. Under the constraint of the constant amplitude, the dimension partitioning method is developed to guarantee the possibility of correct detection for all transmitted information symbols and to further improve the transmission accuracy by increasing the size of the decision regions. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that over frequency selective Rayleigh and Rician fading channels, the system using the proposed channel precoder can achieve a bit error rate (BER) comparable with that using a conventional decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The precoder can outperform the DFE in an indoor environment where there is a strong direct propagation path. The main advantage of using the precoder is that the impairment of ISI due to multipath propagation on the transmission performance can be mitigated without increasing the complexity of the portable unit receiver. The proposed technique is especially useful for personal communications, where ISI due to multipath fading channels can severely deteriorate the BER transmission performance and where the simplicity of portable units is a vital characteristic of the system.","doi":"10.1109/25.740067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15982/00740067.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.740067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel precoding for indoor radio communications using dimension partitioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740067/","displayDocTitle":"Channel precoding for indoor radio communications using dimension partitioning","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6158032","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel precoding for indoor radio communications using dimension partitioning","sourcePdf":"00740067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079212S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"15982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","articleId":"740067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":740077,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

In particular, we examine a technique to assess the reverse link traffic capacity and its sensitivity to various propagation and system parameters. We begin by discussing methods of characterizing interference from other users in the network. These methods are extremely important in the development of the traffic models. We begin with a review of several existing approaches to the problem of handling other-cell interference before presenting a novel characterization of the interference in the form of an analytic expression for the interference distribution function in the deterministic propagation environment. We then look at extending the capacity analyses that assume a fixed and equal number of users in every cell to handle the random nature of call arrivals and departures. The simplest way to do this is by modeling each cell of the network as an independent M/G/x/spl infin/ queue. This allows us to replace the deterministic number of users in each cell by an independent Poisson random variable for each cell. The resulting compound Poisson sums have some very nice properties that allow us to calculate an outage probability by analyzing a single random sum. This leads to a very efficient technique for assessing the reverse link traffic capacity of CDMA cellular networks.","doi":"10.1109/25.740079","startPage":"153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15982/00740079.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.740079","endPage":"165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the teletraffic capacity of CDMA cellular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740079/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"On the teletraffic capacity of CDMA cellular networks","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6158036","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the teletraffic capacity of CDMA cellular networks","sourcePdf":"00740079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050789S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"15982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"107","articleId":"740079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":740085,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Although MLSD is an optimal scheme, its computational complexity limits many applications. The ASA algorithm is a detection method whose performance is close to that of MLSD, but with greatly reduced computational complexity. Adaptive state partitioning in the trellis diagram is used in this algorithm by measuring the short-term received signal power. Also, an adaptive threshold for selecting only a few states of the trellis is employed in this algorithm based on the Chernoff distance between the probability density functions (PDFs) of correct and incorrect branch metrics. The ASA-DF, a special case of ASA using decision feedback, shows a very good tradeoff between the performance and computational complexity for selective fading channels. Using ASA with diversity reception not only improves the performance, but also decreases the computational complexity in comparison with the computational complexity of using MLSD with diversity reception.","doi":"10.1109/25.740085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.740085","startPage":"174","endPage":"187","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15982/00740085.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive state allocation algorithm in MLSD receiver for multipath fading channels: structure and strategy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive state allocation algorithm in MLSD receiver for multipath fading channels: structure and strategy","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6158038","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740085/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive state allocation algorithm in MLSD receiver for multipath fading channels: structure and strategy","sourcePdf":"00740085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08181S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"15982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","articleId":"740085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":740086,"authors":[{"name":"R.N.

The received composite signal is first despread by the filters in the bank. The despreading filter outputs are then weighted and combined. The weight vector is adaptively determined and updated so that the average combined signal power is minimized while keeping the combiner's response to the desired signal constant. The proposed algorithm for OMF weight updating requires neither knowledge about other users' spreading sequences nor desired user's signal reference.

Power control is viewed as essential for interference-limited systems. However, the performance of such systems under an imbalance of load among cells, as may occur often in microcells, is largely unknown. Here, we study a typical interference-limited dynamic channel allocation policy. Calls are accepted if a channel can be assigned that will provide a minimum C/I, and power control and intracell handoffs are used to maintain this level. We focus on the relationship between system performance and the amount of imbalance in load among neighboring cells. Previous studies for systems that do not use C/I information have found that dynamic channel allocation (DCA) outperforms fixed channel allocation (FCA) in all but heavily loaded systems with little load imbalance. We present two principal new results. First, we find that with use of C/I information, the difference in performance between FCA and DCA (in terms of throughput or blocking probability) is increasing with load imbalance. DCA was found to be more effective in congestion control at the cost of a slightly lower call quality. Second, we find that use of power control to maintain a minimum C/I results in two equilibrium average power levels for both DCA and FCA, with DCA using a higher average power than FCA, and that while DCA's power is increasing with load imbalance, FCA's average power is decreasing with load imbalance.","doi":"10.1109/25.740097","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15982/00740097.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.740097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"224","endPage":"232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic channel allocation in interference-limited cellular systems with uneven traffic distribution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic channel allocation in interference-limited cellular systems with uneven traffic distribution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740097/","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6158042","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic channel allocation in interference-limited cellular systems with uneven traffic distribution","sourcePdf":"00740097.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045645S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"15982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"34","articleId":"740097","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":740098,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

In direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) cellular systems, this is limited by the interference present in the link. The interference is affected by many environmental factors, and, thus, the link capacity of the systems varies with the environment. Due to the varying link capacity, static channel assignment (SCA) based on fixed link capacity is not fully using the link capacity. This paper proposes a more efficient channel assignment based on the interference received at the base station (BS). In the proposed algorithm, a channel is assigned if the corresponding interference margin is less than the allowed interference, and, thus, channels are assigned adaptively to dynamically varying link capacity. Using the proposed algorithm yields more channels than using SCA in such an environment changes with nonhomogeneous traffic load or varying radio path loss. The algorithm also improves service grade by reserving channels for handoff calls.","doi":"10.1109/25.740098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15982/00740098.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.740098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference-based channel assignment for DS-CDMA cellular systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740098/","displayDocTitle":"Interference-based channel assignment for DS-CDMA cellular systems","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6158043","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference-based channel assignment for DS-CDMA cellular systems","sourcePdf":"00740098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063593S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"15982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"79","articleId":"740098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":740101,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This paper outlines the effect of two-dimensional (2-D) (vertical and lateral) diffraction and compares a Fresnel-Kirchhoff scalar approach to a vectorial geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) approach applied to a four-ray system. The former can be considered as a generalization of conventional knife-edge diffraction theory while the latter (GTD) is useful in the context of ray tracing. A very good agreement between the Fresnel-Kirchhoff and GTD results is found within the limits of validity of both methods. Moreover, it is shown that conventional knife-edge diffraction theory can largely overestimate attenuation (10-15 dB) behind tall buildings in the center of a city environment. Different frequency bands have been tested for the sake of comparison, and emphasis has been put on the radio communications frequency bands used for the global system for mobile communications (GSM) and DCS/DECT systems at 900 and 1800 MHz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study of lateral profile knife-edge diffraction and ray tracing technique using GTD in urban environment","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.740101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15982/00740101.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.740101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740101/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of lateral profile knife-edge diffraction and ray tracing technique using GTD in urban environment","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6158046","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of lateral profile knife-edge diffraction and ray tracing technique using GTD in urban environment","sourcePdf":"00740101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071243S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"15982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"19","articleId":"740101","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":740103,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaodong Wang","id":"37281375000"},{"name":"H.V.

The performance of many multiuser detectors can degrade substantially in the presence of such impulsive ambient noise. We develop robust multiuser detection techniques for combating multiple-access interference and impulsive noise in CDMA communication systems. These techniques are based on the M-estimation method for robust regression. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed robust techniques offer significant performance gain over linear multiuser detectors in impulsive noise, with little attendant increase in computational complexity. We also develop a subspace-based technique for blind adaptive implementation of the robust multiuser detectors, which requires only the signature waveform and the timing of the desired user in order to demodulate that user's signal. The robust multiuser detection technique and its blind adaptive version can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous CDMA channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15981/00740103.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.740103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.740103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15981","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust multiuser detection in non-Gaussian channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Noise robustness","Detectors","Multiaccess communication","Noise measurement","Degradation","Multiple access interference","Performance analysis","Computational modeling","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","adaptive signal detection","impulse noise","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","multiuser channels","parameter estimation","demodulation","spread spectrum communication","digital radio","radio networks","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust multiuser detection","nonGaussian channels","wireless systems","ambient channel noise","nonGaussian noise","multiple-access interference","performance","impulsive ambient noise","CDMA communication systems","M-estimation method","robust regression","simulation results","linear multiuser detectors","computational complexity","subspace-based technique","blind adaptive implementation","signature waveform","timing","demodulation","asynchronous CDMA channel","synchronous CDMA channel","digital DS-CDMA network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Robust multiuser detection in non-Gaussian channels","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6159585","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust multiuser detection in non-Gaussian channels","sourcePdf":"00740103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038534S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"15981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"247","articleId":"740103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":740104,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In classical MUSIC, the array manifold vector is projected onto an estimate of the signal subspace. Errors in the estimate of the signal subspace can make localization of multiple sources difficult. Recursively applied and projected (RAP) MUSIC uses each successively located source to form an intermediate array gain matrix and projects both the array manifold and the signal subspace estimate into its orthogonal complement. The MUSIC projection to find the next source is then performed in this reduced subspace. Special assumptions about the array manifold structure, such as Vandermonde or shift invariance, are not required. Using the metric of principal angles, we describe a general form of the RAP-MUSIC algorithm for the case of diversely polarized sources. Through a uniform linear array simulation with two highly correlated sources, we demonstrate the improved Monte Carlo error performance of RAP-MUSIC relative to MUSIC and two other sequential subspace methods: S and IES-MUSIC. We then demonstrate the more general utility of this algorithm for multidimensional array manifolds in a magnetoencephalography (MEG) source localization simulation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.740118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15981","startPage":"332","endPage":"340","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15981/00740118.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source localization using recursively applied and projected (RAP) MUSIC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Source localization using recursively applied and projected (RAP) MUSIC","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6159588","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source localization using recursively applied and projected (RAP) MUSIC","sourcePdf":"00740118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036494S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"15981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"251","articleId":"740118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":740119,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The class contains combination of a polynomial-phase signal (PPS) and a frequency-modulated (FM) component of the sinusoidal or hyperbolic type.

A novel approach is proposed that allows us to decouple estimation of the FM parameters from those of the PPS, relying on properties of the multilag high-order ambiguity function (ml-HAF). The accuracy achievable by any unbiased estimator of the hybrid FM-PPS parameters is investigated by means of the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs).

The signals are modeled as the output of a single FIR interpolation filter (single band model) or, more generally, as the sum of the outputs of L FIR interpolation filters (multiband model). These nonbandlimited signals are oversampled, and it is therefore reasonable to expect that we can reap the same benefits of well-known efficient A/D techniques that apply only to bandlimited signals. We first show that we can obtain a great reduction in the quantization noise variance due to the oversampled nature of the signals. We can achieve a substantial decrease in bit rate by appropriately decimating the signals and then quantizing them. To further increase the effective quantizer resolution, noise shaping is introduced by optimizing prefilters and postfilters around the quantizer. We start with a scalar time-invariant quantizer and study two important cases of linear time invariant (LTI) filters, namely, the case where the postfilter is the inverse of the prefilter and the more general case where the postfilter is independent from the prefilter. Closed form expressions for the optimum filters and average minimum mean square error are derived in each case for both the single band and multiband models. The class of noise shaping filters and quantizers is then enlarged to include linear periodically time varying (LPTV)/sub M/ filters and periodically time-varying quantizers of period M. We study two special cases in great detail.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.740124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15981/00740124.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"407","doi":"10.1109/78.740124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oversampling PCM techniques and optimum noise shapers for quantizing a class of nonbandlimited signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Oversampling PCM techniques and optimum noise shapers for quantizing a class of nonbandlimited signals","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6159593","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oversampling PCM techniques and optimum noise shapers for quantizing a class of nonbandlimited signals","sourcePdf":"00740124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061742S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"15981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","articleId":"740124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":740127,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

In such cases, the frequency domain is defined as a uniform discrete grid (as in L-point DFT). This offers more freedom in theoretical as well as design aspects. While circular convolution has been the centerpiece of many algorithms in signal processing for decades, such freedom, especially from the viewpoint of linear system theory, has not been studied in the past. In this paper, we introduce the fundamentals of cyclic multirate systems and filter banks, presenting several important differences between the cyclic and noncyclic cases. Cyclic systems with allpass and paraunitary properties are studied. The paraunitary interpolation problem is introduced, and it is shown that the interpolation does not always succeed. State-space descriptions of cyclic LTI systems are introduced, and the notions of reachability and observability of state equations are revisited. It is shown that unlike in traditional linear systems, these two notions are not related to the system minimality in a simple way. Throughout the paper, a number of open problems are pointed out from the perspective of the signal processor as well as the system theorist.","doi":"10.1109/78.740127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.740127","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15981/00740127.pdf","startPage":"433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic LTI systems in digital signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740127/","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic LTI systems in digital signal processing","volume":"47","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6159596","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic LTI systems in digital signal processing","sourcePdf":"00740127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043568S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"15981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","articleId":"740127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":740131,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The procedure is based on an original form of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm especially adapted to the present situation. We show that this detection algorithm is especially useful for noisy signals with multiridge transforms. It is a common practice among practitioners to reconstruct a signal from the skeleton of a transform of the signal (i.e., the restriction of the transform to the ridges).

Due to its low architectural complexity (low overhead with respect to a simple FIR filter), this network can be used to cope with several nonlinear DSP problems at a high symbol rate. In particular, this work addresses the problem of nonlinear channel equalization. In fact, although several authors have already recognized the usefulness of a neural network as a channel equalizer, one problem has not yet been addressed: the high complexity and the very long data sequence needed to train the network.

We then derive a set of necessary and sufficient geometrical constraints for the two direction parameters, azimuth and elevation, to be uncoupled from each other. Ensuring that these parameters are uncoupled minimizes the bound and means they are the natural or \"canonical\" location parameters for the model. We argue that it provides a compelling array design criterion. We also consider a bound on the mean-square angular error and its asymptotic normalization, which are useful measures in three-dimensional bearing estimation problems. We derive an expression for this bound and discuss it in terms of the sensors' locations. We then show that our previously derived geometrical conditions are also sufficient to ensure that this bound is independent of azimuth. Finally, we extend those conditions to obtain a set of geometrical constraints that ensure the optimal performance is isotropic.","doi":"10.1109/48.740154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/48/15983/00740154.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.740154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of sensor placement on acoustic vector-sensor array performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740154/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of sensor placement on acoustic vector-sensor array performance","volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6158207","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of sensor placement on acoustic vector-sensor array performance","sourcePdf":"00740154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0424S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"15983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"75","articleId":"740154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":740162,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Even though it is conceivable that removal of redundant or less important fuzzy rules from the rule base can result in a compact fuzzy model with better generalizing ability, the decision as to which rules are redundant or less important is not an easy exercise. In this paper, we introduce several orthogonal transformation-based methods that provide new or alternative tools for rule selection. These methods include an orthogonal least squares (OLS) method, an eigenvalue decomposition (ED) method, a singular value decomposition and QR with column pivoting (SVD-QR) method, a total least squares (TLS) method, and a direct singular value decomposition (D-SVD) method. A common attribute of these methods is that they all work on a firing strength matrix and employ some measure index to detect the rules that should be retained and eliminated. We show the performance of these methods by applying them to solving a nonlinear plant modeling problem. Our conclusions based on analysis and simulation can be used as a guideline for choosing a proper rule selection method for a specific application.","doi":"10.1109/3477.740162","startPage":"13","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/15986/00740162.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.740162","endPage":"24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplifying fuzzy rule-based models using orthogonal transformation methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Simplifying fuzzy rule-based models using orthogonal transformation methods","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6156995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","pubMedId":"18252276","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplifying fuzzy rule-based models using orthogonal transformation methods","sourcePdf":"00740162.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049344S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"15986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"204","articleId":"740162","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":740163,"authors":[{"name":"Tzu-Ping Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tzu-Ping Wu","id":"37088022276"},{"name":"Shyi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shyi-Ming Chen","id":"37087168230"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"740163","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":103,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":821},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy sets","Fuzzy systems","Data mining","Knowledge based systems","Knowledge acquisition","Expert systems","Input variables","Training data","MATLAB","Iris"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge acquisition","fuzzy systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["membership functions","fuzzy rules","training examples","knowledge acquisition","rule-based system","expert systems","fuzzy learning","/spl alpha/-cuts","equivalence relations","data classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740163","doi":"10.1109/3477.740163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.740163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15986","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/15986/00740163.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for constructing membership functions and fuzzy rules from training examples","abstract":"To extract knowledge from a set of numerical data and build up a rule-based system is an important research topic in knowledge acquisition and expert systems.

Although the flat networks are used for nonlinear function approximation, they can be formulated as linear systems. Thus, the weights of the networks can be solved easily using a linear least-square method. This formulation makes it easier to update the weights instantly for both a new added pattern and a new added enhancement node. A dynamic stepwise updating algorithm is proposed to update the weights of the system on-the-fly. The model is tested on several time-series data including an infrared laser data set, a chaotic time-series, a monthly flour price data set, and a nonlinear system identification problem. The simulation results are compared to existing models in which more complex architectures and more costly training are needed. The results indicate that the proposed model is very attractive to real-time processes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","volume":"29","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6156999","pubMedId":"18252280","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A rapid learning and dynamic stepwise updating algorithm for flat neural networks and the application to time-series prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rapid learning and dynamic stepwise updating algorithm for flat neural networks and the application to time-series prediction","sourcePdf":"00740166.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04775S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"15986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"138","articleId":"740166","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":740167,"authors":[{"name":"Lipo Wang","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, Deakin University, VIC, Australia","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Lipo Wang","id":"37087219415"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"740167","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":129},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740167","abstract":"Based on the previous work of a number of authors, we discuss an important class of neural networks which we call multi-associative neural networks (MANNs) and which associate one pattern with multiple patterns. As a computationally efficient example of such networks, we describe a specific MANN, that is, a multi-associative, dynamically generated variant of the counterpropagation network (MCPN). As an application of MANNs, we design a general system that can learn and retrieve complex spatio-temporal sequences with any MANN. This system consists of comparator units, a parallel array of MANNs, and delayed feedback lines from the output of the system to the neural network layer. During learning, pairs of sequences of spatial patterns are presented to the system and the system learns-to associate patterns at successive times in sequence. During retrieving, a cue sequence, which may be obscured by spatial noise and temporal gaps, causes the system to output the stored spatio-temporal sequence. We prove analytically that this system is capable of learning and generating any spatio-temporal sequences within the maximum complexity determined by the number of embedded MANNs, with the maximum length and number of sequences determined by the memory capacity of the embedded MANNs. To demonstrate the applicability of this general system, we present an implementation using the MCPN. The system shows desirable properties such as fast and accurate learning and retrieving, and ability to store a large number of complex sequences consisting of nonorthogonal spatial patterns.","doi":"10.1109/3477.740167","startPage":"73","endPage":"82","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/15986/00740167.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.740167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-associative neural networks and their applications to learning and retrieving complex spatio-temporal sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Multilayer perceptrons","Associative memory","Artificial intelligence","Intelligent robots","Computer networks","Delay lines","Output feedback","Neurofeedback","Australia Council"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","associative processing","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-associative neural networks","counterpropagation network","MCPN","delayed feedback","comparator units","spatio-temporal sequences","nonorthogonal spatial patterns","complex sequences","Auto-associative","hetero-associative","multiassociative","neural network","noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740167/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Multi-associative neural networks and their applications to learning and retrieving complex spatio-temporal sequences","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6157000","pubMedId":"18252281","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-associative neural networks and their applications to learning and retrieving complex spatio-temporal sequences","sourcePdf":"00740167.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062829S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"15986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"25","articleId":"740167","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":740172,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"lastName":"Li Chen","id":"37087173680"},{"name":"D.H.

The first stage of the network is fuzzy based. It has two parts: a parameter computing network (PCN), followed by a converting layer. In the PCN the weights of the nodes are possibility functions, and hence, the output of this network is a fuzzy set. The second part of this stage, which is a single layer network, then converts this fuzzy set into a scalar vector for input to the second stage. The second stage of the network is a standard backpropagation based neural network.

Many different types of mapping heuristics have been developed in recent years. However, selecting the best heuristic to use in any given scenario remains a difficult problem. Factors making this selection difficult are discussed. Motivated by these difficulties, a new taxonomy for classifying mapping heuristics for HC environments is proposed (Purdue HC Taxonomy). The taxonomy is defined in three major parts: the models used for applications and communication requests; the models used for target hardware platforms; and the characteristics of mapping heuristics, Each part of the taxonomy is described, with examples given to help clarify the taxonomy. The benefits and uses of this taxonomy are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/RELDIS.1998.740518","startPage":"330","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventeenth IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (Cat.

The described AI system uses tool-specific, run-time input to predict the resource-usage characteristics of runs. Instance-based learning with locally weighted polynomial regression is employed because of the need to simultaneously learn multiple polynomial concepts and the fact that knowledge is acquired incrementally in this domain. An innovative use of a two-level knowledge base allows the system to account for short-term variations in compute-server and network performance and exploit temporal and spatial locality of runs. Instance editing allows the approach to be tolerant to noise and computationally feasible for extended use. The learning system was tested on three tools during normal use of the Purdue University Network Computing Hubs. Results indicate that the described instance-based learning technique using locally weighted regression with a locally linear model works well for this domain.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15987","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventeenth IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (Cat.

The multimedia applications can vary from distributed games and shared whiteboards to interactive video conferencing. These applications often involve a large number of participants and are interactive in nature, with participants dynamically joining and leaving the applications. In order to provide many-to-many interaction when the number of participants is large, IP multicasting is a very good option for communication. IP multicasting provides scalability and efficient routing but does not provide the reliability that these multimedia applications may require. Though a lot of research has been done on reliable multicast transport protocols, it really seems that the only way of doing a reliable multicast is to build it for a given purpose like conference control in multimedia conferencing. This paper compares some of the available multicast transport protocols and analyses the most suitable features and functionalities provided by these protocols for a facet of conference control: floor control. The goal is to find or design a reliable multicast transport protocol which would scale to tens or hundreds of participants scattered across the Internet and which would deliver the control messages reliably.","doi":"10.1109/RELDIS.1998.740535","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventeenth IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (Cat.

A novel neural network architecture, referred to as a variable neural network, is proposed and shown to be useful in approximating the unknown nonlinearities of dynamical systems. In the variable neural networks, the number of basis functions can be either increased or decreased with time, according to specified design strategies, so that the network will not overfit or underfit the data set. Based on the Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF) variable neural network, an adaptive control scheme is presented. The location of the centers and the determination of the widths of the GRBFs in the variable neural network are analyzed to make a compromise between orthogonality and smoothness. The weight-adaptive laws developed using the Lyapunov synthesis approach guarantee the stability of the overall control scheme, even in the presence of modeling error(s). The tracking errors converge to the required accuracy through the adaptive control algorithm derived by combining the variable neural network and Lyapunov synthesis techniques. The operation of an adaptive control scheme using the variable neural network is demonstrated using two simulated examples.","doi":"10.1109/5326.740668","pdfPath":"/iel4/5326/15998/00740668.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"43","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5326.740668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable neural networks for adaptive control of nonlinear systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Variable neural networks for adaptive control of nonlinear systems","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6157536","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable neural networks for adaptive control of nonlinear systems","sourcePdf":"00740668.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081419S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"15998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"77","articleId":"740668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":740669,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Each activity's operation mode has a different duration and requires different amounts of renewable and nonrenewable resources. The objective is the minimization of the project duration or makespan. The problem under consideration is known to be one of the most difficult scheduling problems, and it is hard to find a feasible solution for such a problem, let alone the optimal one. The GA approach described in this paper incorporates problem-specific scheduling knowledge by an indirect chromosome encoding that consists of selected activity operating modes and an ordered set of scheduling rules. The scheduling rules in the chromosome are used in an iterative scheduling algorithm that constructs the schedule resulting from the chromosome. The proposed GA is denoted a hybrid GA (HGA) approach, since it is integrated with traditional scheduling tools and expertise specifically developed for the general resource-constrained project scheduling problem. The results demonstrate that HGA approach produces near-optimal solutions within a reasonable amount of computation time.","doi":"10.1109/5326.740669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5326/15998/00740669.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5326.740669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm approach to a general category project scheduling problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740669/","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm approach to a general category project scheduling problem","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6157537","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm approach to a general category project scheduling problem","sourcePdf":"00740669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036525S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"15998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"94","articleId":"740669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":740670,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To efficiently identify the structure and the parameters of the new fuzzy model, we first partition the output space instead of the input space. As a result, the input space itself induces corresponding partitions within each of which inputs would have similar outputs. Then we use a set of hyperrectangles to fit the partitions of the input space. Consequently, the premise of an implication in the new type of fuzzy rule is represented by a hyperrectangle and the consequence is represented by a fuzzy singleton. A novel two-layer fuzzy hyperrectangular composite neural network (FHRCNN) can be shown to be computationally equivalent to such a special fuzzy model. The process of presenting input data to each hidden node in a FHRCNN is equivalent to firing a fuzzy rule. An efficient learning algorithm was developed to adjust the weights of an FHRCNN. Finally, we apply FHRCNNs to provide real-time transient stability prediction for use with high-speed control in power systems. From simulation tests on the IEEE 39-bus system, it reveals that the proposed novel FHRCNN can yield a much better performance than that of conventional multilayer perceptrons (MLP's) in terms of computational burden and classification rate.","doi":"10.1109/5326.740677","startPage":"149","endPage":"157","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5326/15998/00740677.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5326.740677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-network-based fuzzy model and its application to transient stability prediction in power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system transients","Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Power system stability","Power system control","Power system simulation","Fuzzy systems","Computer networks","Real time systems","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","power engineering computing","power system transient stability","real-time systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network-based fuzzy model","transient stability prediction","power systems","complex system","numerical information","linguistic information","output space partitioning","hyperrectangles","fuzzy rule","fuzzy singleton","two-layer fuzzy hyperrectangular composite neural network","learning algorithm","high-speed control","simulation","IEEE 39-bus system","performance","multilayer perceptrons","computational burden","classification rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-based fuzzy model and its application to transient stability prediction in power systems","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6157545","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-based fuzzy model and its application to transient stability prediction in power systems","sourcePdf":"00740677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045243S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"15998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"21","articleId":"740677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":740691,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The water/oil system was studied in the practical important concentration range of 0 to 130 /spl mu/g/g to explain the unusual decrease of the breakdown strength. The relationship between water concentration and oil breakdown strength was determined in the range 0 to 50 /spl mu/g/g, using almost 100 oil samples taken from functioning transformers from each part of Hungary. The plotted data can be approached by two straight lines having very different slope, from which we conclude that the water/oil system has two different structures in this concentration range. The water in oil structure was examined by both theoretical and experimental methods. By a Hartree-Fock calculation the distance between water and hydrocarbon molecules was estimated. The water molecules arrangement and distance were calculated by a geometrical model. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was applied for experimental structure determination. Three oil samples were selected in the range 0 to 50 /spl mu/g/g. Assigning the OH vibration bands revealed that water is present in low concentration as monomer and at higher concentration in cluster forms (dimers, tetramers etc.). Similar graphs were found of the total dipole moment of water clusters vs. The resistance of insulating oil and the water concentration vs. the breakdown strength. The latter curve can be explained with the different state of water in oil. Water is present in molecular disperse state at /spl gsim/10 /spl mu/g/g. Above this value water clusters appear.

The cascade inverter is a natural fit for large automotive all-electric drives because it uses several levels of DC voltage sources, which would be available from batteries or fuel cells. The back-to-back diode-clamped converter is ideal where a source of AC voltage is available, such as in a hybrid electric vehicle.

The signal is not a rotating one, but a fluctuating one at a synchronous rotating reference frame with the fundamental stator frequency. When the estimated rotor flux angle coincides with the actual angle, the proposed method makes virtually no ripple torque, no vibration and less audible noise caused by the injected signal. The difference of impedances between the flux axis and the quadrature axis at high-frequency signal injection on the rotor flux angle is explained by the equivalent circuit equation of the induction machine. The difference is verified by experiments on the test motors at various testing conditions. The sensorless field-orientation algorithm is proposed, and the experimental results clarify the satisfactory operation of the algorithm with 150% load torque at zero stator frequency.","doi":"10.1109/28.740844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/28/15999/00740844.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.740844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless field-orientation control of an induction machine by high-frequency signal injection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740844/","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless field-orientation control of an induction machine by high-frequency signal injection","volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6158098","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless field-orientation control of an induction machine by high-frequency signal injection","sourcePdf":"00740844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024781S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1999","isNumber":"15999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"231","articleId":"740844","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":740845,"authors":[{"name":"C.B.

If the system has a single source, an iterative technique is normally used. However, this becomes cumbersome when solving systems with multiple sources and multiple fault locations. Previous methods have adjusted the resistance of all static sources by a fixed percentage. Methods for providing multiplying factors to adjust the fault contributions of static sources which differentiate between local and remote sources are discussed. Individual multiplying factors for each source may be calculated by means of a formula, or an approximate multiplying factor for all sources may be found by iteration. The multiplying factors are then applied to the results of a single-step matrix solution for the short-circuit currents. This facilitates the use of computer spreadsheet programs for the solution of the problem. It is concluded that the use of a fixed multiplying factor may offer the most conservative solution method.","doi":"10.1109/28.740858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/28/15999/00740858.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.740858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=740858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC short-circuit analysis for systems with static sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740858/","displayDocTitle":"DC short-circuit analysis for systems with static sources","volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6158112","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC short-circuit analysis for systems with static sources","sourcePdf":"00740858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024446S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1999","isNumber":"15999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"13","articleId":"740858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":740880,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The algorithm incorporates a filter bank (FB) which decomposes the ECG into subbands with uniform frequency bandwidths. The FB-based algorithm enables independent time and frequency analysis to be performed on a signal. Features computed from a set of the subbands and a heuristic detection strategy are used to fuse decisions from multiple one-channel beat detection algorithms. The overall beat detection algorithm has a sensitivity of 99.59% and a positive predictivity of 99.56% against the MIT/BIH database. Furthermore this is a real-time algorithm since its beat detection latency is minimal. The FB-based beat detection algorithm also inherently lends itself to a computationally efficient structure since the detection logic operates at the subband rate.

Based on the carrier separation measurement for p-channel MOSFETs, the quantum yield of impact ionization for electrons involved in the SILC process is evaluated directly from the change in the source and gate currents of p-MOSFETs before and after stressing. Since the relationship between the electron energy and the quantum yield is established for direct and FN tunneling currents, the electron energy of electrons involved in the SILC process can be determined from the quantum yield. The results reveal that the measured energy of electrons in the SILC process is lower roughly by 1.5 eV than the energy expected in the elastic tunneling process. Trap-assisted inelastic tunneling model is proposed as a conduction mechanism of SILC accompanied by energy relaxation. It is shown, through the evaluation of the substrate hole current in n-channel MOSFETs, that the contribution of trap-assisted valence electron tunneling, another possible mechanism to explain the energy relaxation, to SILC is small.","doi":"10.1109/16.740899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.740899","endPage":"341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/16002/00740899.pdf","startPage":"335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental evidence of inelastic tunneling in stress-induced leakage current","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/740899/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental evidence of inelastic tunneling in stress-induced leakage current","volume":"46","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6164816","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental evidence of inelastic tunneling in stress-induced leakage current","sourcePdf":"00740899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043957S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"156","articleId":"740899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":740904,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The position and velocity of all transmitters are detected in parallel. Using digital beam forming steering beams are available in very high velocity only limited by the capacity of the processor.

The greatest benefits with cochlear implantation have occurred in patients who (1) acquired speech and language before their hearing loss, and (2) have shorter duration of deafness.

The performance of the new multiuser detector is close to the decorrelating decision-feedback detector, but its construction is simpler.

The ICI is a random process caused by channel frequency errors, its distribution function is unknown. This paper gives theoretical BER expressions of OFDM systems, by exploring ICI performance in comparison with conventional single carrier communication systems. First, the BER upper bound is obtained by assuming that the received signals suffer maximum ICI. Then, by using the sequence development BER calculation method, an accurate theoretical BER expression for OFDM systems is derived and validated by simulations. In addition, such a BER calculation method is applied to the \"ICI self cancellation OFDM system\", which is a system proposed for reducing system ICI signal level. It shows that BER of ICI self cancellation OFDM systems is rather robust to channel frequency errors, while the BER of normal OFDM systems increases rapidly with increasing frequency error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER analysis of OFDM communication systems with intercarrier interference","publicationTitle":"ICCT'98. 1998 International Conference on Communication Technology.

Depending of the architecture of the transmultiplexer performing the modulation/demodulation the inter-channel and intersymbol interference can be determined. The transmultiplexer using a cosine modulated filter bank (CMFB) composed of N Nyquist bandpass filters with a filter genus bigger than one performs better than the conventional method that uses the FFT. To verify the behavior of the proposed MC-CDMA system with respect to the number of subcarrier and genus of the prototype filter, the reverse-link bit error rates under flat fading and additive white Gaussian noise channel environments are analyzed and simulated. The results show a 3 dB improvement over the conventional MC-CDMA.","displayPublicationTitle":"ICCT'98. 1998 International Conference on Communication Technology. Proceedings (IEEE Cat.

In ATM networks, traffic control design becomes an important challenge, because of the diverse services support and the need for efficient network resource engineering. Two important functions for traffic control in ATM networks are policing and routing. The goal of these two functions is to guarantee the required quality of service. So far, all studies have treated policing and routing in a separate way. The combination of policing and routing can guarantee a better quality of service and increase the network utilization. Traditional network control strategies are not well suited for high speed networks. Use of intelligent algorithms based on fuzzy logic, neural networks and genetic algorithms can prove to be efficient for traffic control in ATM networks. We propose an intelligent policing-routing mechanism based on fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms. Performance evaluation via simulations shows that the proposed mechanism performs better than conventional policing mechanisms and routing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.1998.741104","pdfPath":"/iel4/5962/15952/00741104.pdf","startPage":"390","endPage":"397","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (Cat.

As the higher issue degree of superscalar microprocessor is provided, an aggressive scheduling policy of load/store operations becomes crucial. We examine the scheduling policies of loads/stores on x86 superscalar microprocessors and propose a new aggressive scheduling policy called load speculation, which allows loads to precede the previous unsolved pending stores. Simulation results show that the load speculation achieves the higher performance in comparison with the traditional scheduling policies such as load bypassing and load forwarding.

The time complexity of this architecture is O(n), which is optimal. We next propose the partitioning into a fixed number of off the shelf processing elements. Two alternative partitioning strategies are presented considering restrictions, not only in the number of the cells, but also in the inner structure of each cell. In the most restricted case, the proposed architecture has time complexity O(n/sup 3//p*k), where p is the number of available cells and the elements inside each cell are at most k.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.1998.741168","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (Cat.

A PEBB is not a specific semiconductor material, not a device, nor a circuit topology. It is the search for the common electrical, mechanical and thermal denominators of all these, allowing integration of all these technologies. It is not; \"one size fits all\". There will be several blocks that will fit together to perform the majority of everyday power electronic jobs. Like a set of children's interlocking blocks, PEBBs will be a rational and simple set of blocks and procedures that most any designer or architect can use to build electrical systems. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is developing Power Electronic Building Blocks to achieve: increased power density, \"user friendly\" design (\"plug and play\" power modules), and multi-functionality. Digital controls, integrated with higher frequency and more robust power circuits, enable modular power systems with lower size, weight, and cost-while increasing performance. Although the day when solid-state will replace tubes in high-power modulator applications is still in the future, many near-term opportunities exist for PEBBs and associated technologies. This paper presents requirements, opportunities and issues for standardized power modules. First, an overview of the PEBB program is given. Then, opportunities are examined for technologies developed by the PEBB program.","doi":"10.1109/MODSYM.1998.741179","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Twenty-Third International Power Modulator Symposium (Cat.

This factor results in various fading especially in a chip duration of the direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system. To solve this problem, a modified Wiener beamforming (MWB) has been proposed to co-phase the multipath components and then combine them by maximum ratio combining in a chip duration. We derive formulas for MWB with a method to separate and estimate multipath vectors through each chip. Our purpose is to isolate and recombine multipath components before they are added together as a phasor to produce fading. Therefore, the fading of Rayleigh or Rice distributed multipath in a chip duration can be reduced to a minimum. Simulation results are presented by using a three-dimensional ray tracing to support the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCT.1998.741267","displayPublicationTitle":"ICCT'98. 1998 International Conference on Communication Technology.

A dispersive perfectly matched layer (DPML) boundary condition, which is suitable for boundary matching to such a dispersive media whole space, is also proposed to truncate the FDTD simulation domain. The numerical simulation of a Ricker wavelet propagating in a dispersive medium, described by second-order Debye model, shows that the Ricker wavelet is attenuated in amplitude and expanded in time in its course of propagation, as required by Kramers-Kronig relations. The numerical results also are compared to exact solution showing that the dispersive FDTD method is accurate and that the DPML boundary condition effectively dampens reflective waves. The method presented here is applicable to the simulation of ultrasonic instrumentation for medical imaging and other nondestructive testing problems with frequency dependent, attenuating media.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/58/16007/00741419.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.741419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.741419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=741419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of acoustic wave propagation in dispersive media with relaxation losses by using FDTD method with PML absorbing boundary condition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic waves","Acoustic propagation","Dispersion","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Boundary conditions","Attenuation","Perfectly matched layers","Numerical simulation","Medical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic wave propagation","dispersive media","finite difference time-domain analysis","Kramers-Kronig relations","acoustic field","acoustic dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic wave propagation","dispersive media","relaxation losses","FDTD method","PML absorbing boundary condition","dispersive perfectly matched layer","Ricker wavelet","second-order Debye model","Kramers-Kronig relations","ultrasonic instrumentation","medical imaging","nondestructive testing problems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/741419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of acoustic wave propagation in dispersive media with relaxation losses by using FDTD method with PML absorbing boundary condition","volume":"46","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6158784","pubMedId":"18238394","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of acoustic wave propagation in dispersive media with relaxation losses by using FDTD method with PML absorbing boundary condition","sourcePdf":"00741419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046138S","chronDate":"Jan.  1999","isNumber":"16007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"45","articleId":"741419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":741427,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Lubinski","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Departments, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Lubinski","id":"37373372300"},{"name":"S.Y.

Tradeoffs between spatial resolution and estimate variance are discussed, and estimation in elasticity imaging is compared to traditional time-delay estimation.

We also developed a stable method for uniquely reconstructing a shear modulus distribution using strains derived from the measurement data. However, as in our measurement method a displacement is determined by using the phase characteristics of the finite local echo data as the index to iteratively search for the corresponding local data, change of the local phase characteristics due to tissue deformation deteriorates the accuracy of the determination. Thus, we improve the previous method such that, in principle, the displacement can be determined using an infinitesimal phase characteristics. That is, we incorporate an effective mechanism into the previous iterative phase matching scheme: the local size is made suitably smaller during the iterative phase matching. The demonstrated ability of measurement and reconstruction in simulation, and experiments on in vitro in pork rib and in vivo in breast tissue, shows this refinement allows not only better spatial resolution of the shear modulus image but also improved accuracy, and indicates that the improved method has a high potential to be applied for various soft tissues.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/741527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6158792","pubMedId":"18238410","displayDocTitle":"Fine elasticity imaging utilizing the iterative RF-echo phase matching method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine elasticity imaging utilizing the iterative RF-echo phase matching method","sourcePdf":"00741527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085046S","chronDate":"Jan.  1999","isNumber":"16007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"69","articleId":"741527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":741614,"authors":[{"name":"I.

While these characteristics are poorly matched to conventional microprocessor architectures, they are a good fit for modern VLSI technology with its high arithmetic capacity but limited global bandwidth. The stream programming model, in which an application is coded as streams of data records passing through computation kernels, exposes both parallelism and locality in media applications that can be exploited by VLSI architectures. The Imagine architecture supports the stream programming model by providing a bandwidth hierarchy tailored to the demands of media applications. Compared to a conventional scalar processor. Imagine reduces the global register and memory bandwidth required by typical applications by factors of 13 and 21 respectively. This bandwidth efficiency enables a single chip Imagine processor to achieve a peak performance of 16.2GFLOPS (single-precision floating point) and sustained performance of up to 8.5GFLOPS on media processing kernels.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/5957/15942/00742118.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"13","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1998.742118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1998.742118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=742118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bandwidth-efficient architecture for media processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Computer architecture","Bandwidth","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing","Very large scale integration","Kernel","Microprocessors","Arithmetic","Parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","microprocessor chips","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth-efficient architecture","media processing","microprocessor architectures","VLSI technology","arithmetic capacity","Imagine architecture","stream programming model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/742118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","displayDocTitle":"A bandwidth-efficient architecture for media processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6129233","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-2 Dec. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bandwidth-efficient architecture for media processing","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00742118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028721S","chronDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","isNumber":"15942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5957","citationCount":"117","articleId":"742118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":742710,"authors":[{"name":"T.O.

Although a vector architecture may be a good match for multimedia applications, there is growing evidence that the control logic for increasingly complex superscalar processors is difficult to implement, Rather than combining a complex superscalar core with short wide vector hardware, we propose using a much simpler processor design that is similar to traditional vector computers with long vectors and simple control logic for instruction issue. Such a design would use the bulk of its transistors and die area for datapath and registers, and thus lessen the time required to design, implement, and verify control. In this paper we present data that quantifies this trading of control transistors for datapath and register transistors. We demonstrate that a 2-way, in-order vector processor with a vector length of 64 and a vector width of 8 requires no more die area, and possibly significantly less area, than a 4-way, out-of-order superscalar processor with short vector extensions. Furthermore, we show that the simple long vector processor is, on average, 2.7 times faster executing multimedia applications than the superscalar processor; and 1.6 times faster than one with short vector extensions. To explain the reasons for the higher performance, we analyze execution time in terms of dynamic operation count and cycles per operation (CPO). A vector processor executes fewer operations by using vector instructions to stripmine a loop. Moreover, a long vector processor achieves a lower CPO by effectively using parallelism at both the operation and the instruction levels. Thus by reducing both terms of the CPO equation, the simple long vector processor achieves greater performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microprocessors","Vector processors","Hardware","Logic design","Registers","Application software","Process design","Computer aided instruction","Out of order","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector processor systems","multimedia systems","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector microprocessors","multimedia applications","instruction-set architectures","superscalar processors","superscalar processor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=742766","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1998.742766","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/5957/15942/00742766.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1998.742766","startPage":"25","endPage":"36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15942","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple vector microprocessors for multimedia applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simple vector microprocessors for multimedia applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/742766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","conferenceDate":"2-2 Dec. 1998","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6129235","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple vector microprocessors for multimedia applications","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00742766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045338S","chronDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","isNumber":"15942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5957","citationCount":"23","articleId":"742766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":742770,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

Since the introduction of gshare and the observation that aliasing in the PHT is a major factor in reducing prediction accuracy, several schemes have been proposed to reduce aliasing in the PHT. All these schemes are aimed at maximizing the prediction accuracy with the fewest resources. In this paper we introduce Yet Another Global Scheme (YAGS)-a new scheme to reduce the aliasing in the PHT-that combines the strong points of several previous schemes. YAGS introduces tags into the PHT that allows it to be reduced without sacrificing key branch outcome information. The size reduction more than offsets the cost of the tags. Our experimental results show that YAGS gives better prediction accuracy for the SPEC95 benchmark suite than several leading prediction schemes, for the same cost. It also performs better than the other schemes in the presence of a context switch. Finally, YAGS displays good results for the go benchmark, which is of special interest since it has a large number of static branches and reflects situations where aliasing in the PHT can be a problem.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1998.742770","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/5957/15942/00742770.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1998.742770","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","startPage":"69","endPage":"77","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The YAGS branch prediction scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=742770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","displayDocTitle":"The YAGS branch prediction scheme","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/742770/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6129239","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-2 Dec. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The YAGS branch prediction scheme","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00742770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028938S","chronDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","isNumber":"15942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5957","citationCount":"65","articleId":"742770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":742773,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Although instruction prefetching is an attractive technique for tolerating this latency, we find that existing prefetching schemes are insufficient for modern superscalar processors since they fail to issue prefetches early enough (particularly for non-sequential accesses). To overcome these limitations, we propose a new instruction prefetching technique whereby the hardware and software cooperate to hide the latency as follows. The hardware performs aggressive sequential prefetching combined with a novel prefetch filtering mechanism to allow it to get far ahead without polluting the cache. To hide the latency of non-sequential accesses, we propose and implement a novel compiler algorithm which automatically inserts instruction prefetch instructions into the executable to prefetch the targets of control transfers far enough in advance. Our experimental results demonstrate that this new approach results in speedups ranging from 9.4% to 18.5% (13.3% on average) over the original execution time on an out-of-order superscalar processor; which is more than double the average speedup of the best existing schemes (6.5%). This is accomplished by hiding an average of 71% of the original instruction stall time, compared with only 36% for the best existing schemes. We find that both the prefetch filtering and compiler-inserted prefetching components of our design are essential and complementary, that the compiler can limit the code expansion to less than 10% on average, and that our scheme is robust with respect to variations in miss latency and bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1998.742780","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","startPage":"182","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1998.742780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15942","pdfPath":"/iel4/5957/15942/00742780.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Hardware","Delay","Computer science","National electric code","Application software","Ear","Filtering","Read only memory","Electronic switching systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program compilers","performance evaluation","computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instruction prefetching","cache miss latency","performance bottleneck","prefetch filtering","compiler-inserted prefetching","compiler"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative prefetching: compiler and hardware support for effective instruction prefetching in modern processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/742780/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6129249","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"2-2 Dec. 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative prefetching: compiler and hardware support for effective instruction prefetching in modern processors","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00742780.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034053S","chronDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","isNumber":"15942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5957","citationCount":"6","articleId":"742780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":742784,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Threads are created automatically by hardware at procedure and loop boundaries and executed speculatively on a simultaneous multithreading pipeline. Data prediction is used to alleviate dependency constraints and enable lookahead execution of the threads. A two-level hierarchy significantly enlarges the instruction window. Efficient selective recovery from the second level instruction window takes place after a mispredicted input to a thread is corrected. The second level is slower to access but has the advantage of large storage capacity. We show several advantages of this architecture: (1) it minimizes the impact of ICache misses and branch mispredictions by fetching and dispatching instructions out-of-order, (2) it uses a novel value prediction and recovery mechanism to reduce artificial data dependencies created by the use of a stack to manage run-time storage, and (3) it improves the execution throughput of a superscalar by 15% without increasing the execution resources or cache bandwidth, and by 30% with one additional ICache fetch port.

The return-address stack is a small but important structure for achieving better control-flow prediction accuracy and therefore better performance. But wrong-path execution after mispredictions frequently corrupts the return-address stack, making repair mechanisms necessary. If the processor implements multipath execution-simultaneously executing both sides of a branch-the contention among different paths makes the problem more severe. For conventional, single-path processors, this paper proposes saving both the top-of-stack pointer and the top-of-stack contents for later restoration in case of a misprediction. This simple technique achieves nearly 100% hit rates and improves performance by up to 8.7% compared to a stack with no repair mechanism. For multipath processors, providing each path with its own return-address stack completely eliminates contention, improving performance by over 25%.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1998.742787","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/5957/15942/00742787.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1998.742787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving prediction for procedure returns with return-address-stack repair mechanisms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=742787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/742787/","displayDocTitle":"Improving prediction for procedure returns with return-address-stack repair mechanisms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6129256","conferenceDate":"2-2 Dec. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving prediction for procedure returns with return-address-stack repair mechanisms","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00742787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048345S","chronDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","isNumber":"15942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5957","citationCount":"29","articleId":"742787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":742792,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In such processors, the register file and functional units are partitioned and grouped into clusters. Instruction scheduling for a clustered machine requires assignment and scheduling of operations to the clusters. In this paper, a new scheduling algorithm named unified-assign-and-schedule (UAS) is proposed for clustered, statically-scheduled architectures. UAS merges the cluster assignment and instruction scheduling phases in a natural and straightforward fashion. We compared the performance of UAS with various heuristics to the well-known Bottom-up Greedy (BUG) algorithm and to an optimal cluster scheduling algorithm, measuring the schedule lengths produced by all of the schedulers. Our results show that UAS gives better performance than the BUG algorithm and is quite close to optimal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified assign and schedule: a new approach to scheduling for clustered register file microarchitectures","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1998.742792","startPage":"308","endPage":"315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1998.742792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15942","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 31st Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/5957/15942/00742792.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=742792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/742792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","displayDocTitle":"Unified assign and schedule: a new approach to scheduling for clustered register file microarchitectures","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6129260","conferenceDate":"2-2 Dec. 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified assign and schedule: a new approach to scheduling for clustered register file microarchitectures","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00742792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033851S","chronDate":"30 Nov-2 Dec 1998","isNumber":"15942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5957","citationCount":"64","articleId":"742792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":742798,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

Some heterogeneous FPGAs do not have limitations on the availability of LUTs of specific sizes within chip capacity due to the configuration flexibility of their PLBs, while others, such as Altera FLEX10K devices and Vantis VF1 FPGAs, have limited number of LUTs of certain types (such as embedded memory blocks), which we call heterogeneous FPGAs with bounded resources. LUTs of different sizes usually have different delays. In this paper, we study the technology mapping problem for delay minimization for heterogeneous FPGAs with bounded resources. We show that it is NP-Hard for general networks, but can be solved optimally in pseudo-polynomial time for trees. We then present two heuristic algorithms, named BinaryHM and CN-HM, for delay minimization of general networks for heterogeneous FPGA designs with bounded resources. We have tested BinaryHM and CN-HM on MONO benchmarks on Altera FLEX10K device family, which can be taken as the heterogeneous FPGAs with 4-LUTs and a limited number of 11-LUTs. The experimental results show that compared with FlowMap using only 4-LUTs, both BinaryHM and CN-HM can reduce more than 20% of the circuit mapping delays, 27% of the 4-LUT area and 10% of the circuit layout delays by making efficient use of the available heterogeneous LUTs.","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Although it is possible to reconfigure some FPGAs while an embedded system is operational, this feature is seldom exploited. Recent improvements in the flexibility and reconfiguration speed of FPGAs have made it practical to reconfigure them dynamically, reducing the amount of hardware required in an embedded system. We have developed a system, called CORDS, which synthesizes multi-rate, real-time, periodic distributed embedded systems containing dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs. Executing different tasks on the same FPGA requires that potentially time-consuming reconfiguration be carried out between tasks. CORDS uses a novel preemptive, dynamic priority, multi-rate scheduling algorithm to deal with this problem. To the best of our knowledge, dynamically reconfigured FPGAs have not previously been used in hardware-software co-synthesis of embedded systems. Experimental results indicate that using dynamically reconfigured FPGAs in distributed real-time embedded systems has the potential to reduce their price and allow the synthesis of architectures which meet system specifications that would otherwise be infeasible.","doi":"10.1145/288548.288561","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

This method allows automated extraction of reduced models for nonlinear RF blocks, such as mixers and filters, that have a near linear signal path but may contain strongly nonlinear time varying components. The models have the accuracy of a transistor level nonlinear simulation, but are very compact and so can be used in system level simulation and design. The model reduction procedure is based on a multipoint rational approximation algorithm formed by orthogonal projection of the original time varying linear system into an approximate Krylov subspace. The models obtained from the approximate Krylov subspace projector can be obtained much more easily than the exact projectors but show negligible difference in accuracy.","doi":"10.1145/288548.288583","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Yamashita et al. (1996) introduced a new category for expressing the flexibility that a node can have in a multi level network. Originally presented in the context of FPGA synthesis, the paper has wider implications which were discussed by R.K. Brayton (1997). SPFDs are essentially a set of incompletely specified functions. The increased flexibility that they offer is obtained by allowing both a node to change as well as its immediate fanins. The challenge with SPFDs is: (1) to compute them in an efficient way, and (2) to use their increased flexibility in a controlled way to optimize a circuit. We provide a complete implementation of SPFDs using BDDs and apply it to the optimization of Boolean networks. Two scenarios are presented, one which trades literals for wires and the other rewires the network by replacing one fanin at a node by a new fanin. Results on benchmark circuits are very favorable.","doi":"10.1145/288548.288584","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Undesired perturbations, i.e. noise, in practical electronic systems adversely affect the spectral and timing properties of oscillators resulting in phase noise, which is a key performance limiting factor, being a major contributor to bit-error-rate (BER) of RF communication systems, and creating synchronization problems in clocked and sampled data systems. We first present a theory and numerical methods for nonlinear perturbation and noise analysis of oscillators described by a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs), which extends our recent results on perturbation analysis of autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In developing the above theory, we rely on novel results we establish for linear periodically time varying (LPTV) systems: Floquet theory for DAEs. We then use this nonlinear perturbation analysis to derive the stochastic characterization, including the resulting oscillator spectrum, of phase noise in oscillators due to colored (e.g., 1/f noise), as opposed to white noise sources. The case of white noise sources has already been treated by us in a recent publication (A. Demir et al., 1998). The results of the theory developed in this work enabled us to implement a rigorous and effective analysis and design tool in a circuit simulator for low phase noise oscillator design.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1998.144262","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

We demonstrate that the difficulty of erasing an author's signature or finding another signature in the synthesized design can be made arbitrarily computationally difficult.

A discrete channel model for noisy digital logic in deep submicron technology that captures the manifestation of circuit noise is presented. The lower bounds are derived via an information-theoretic approach whereby a VLSI architecture implemented in a certain technology is viewed as a channel with information transfer capacity C (in bits/sec). A computing application is shown to require a minimum information transfer rate R (also in bits/sec). Lower bounds are obtained by employing the information theoretic constraint C>R. This constraint ensures reliability of computation though in an asymptotic sense. Lower bounds on transition activity at the output of noisy logic gates are also obtained using this constraint. Past work (for noiseless bus coding) is shown to fall out as a special case. In addition, lower bounds on energy dissipation is computed by solving an optimization problem where the objective function is the energy subject to the constraint of C>R. A surprising result is that in a scenario where capacitive component of power dissipation dominates: the voltage for minimum energy is greater than the minimum voltage for reliable operation. For an off-chip I/O signaling example, we show that the lower bounds are a factor of 24/spl times/ below present day systems and that a very simple Hamming code can reduce the energy consumption by a factor of 3/spl times/.

As a result, amplifier design problems can be formulated as a geometric program, a special type of convex optimization problem for which very efficient global optimization methods have recently been developed. The synthesis method is therefore fast, and determines the globally optimal design; in particular the final solution is completely independent of the starting point (which can even be infeasible), and infeasible specifications are unambiguously detected. After briefly introducing the method, which is described in more detail by M. Hershenson et al., we show how the method can be applied to six common op-amp architectures, and give several example designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

It is named operating point driven DC formulation because the operating point is specified directly, and the device dimensions W and L are determined out of it. With other methods, one specifies the device dimensions W and L and determines the operating point. Our method is important for manual design because it allows the designer to reason in terms of voltages and currents and relieves him from the burden of determining device sizes. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge, and is computationally efficient, which allows interactive design space exploration using optimization based sizing. A design plan used in optimization based sizing consists for the largest part out of solving the DC part. Speeding up the DC part with a computationally efficient algorithm that allows parallelisation, results in a boost of optimization speed.","doi":"10.1145/288548.288629","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

The starting point of this methodology is a declarative analytical description of the circuit. An equation manipulation program based on constraint satisfaction converts this declarative model into an efficient design plan for optimization based sizing. The efficiency is due to the use of an operating point driven DC formulation, so that the design plan avoids the calculation of simultaneous sets of nonlinear equations. From the same declarative analytical description also a direct symbolic yield estimation plan is generated. The parametric yield is estimated by propagating the spread of the technological variables through the analytical model towards the performance variables of the circuit. The design plan and the yield estimation plan are then combined together in the inner loop of a global optimization routine. The strength of this methodology lies in the low CPU times needed to perform yield estimation compared to the hours of simulation batches with Monte Carlo simulations, while the accuracy is comparable.","doi":"10.1145/288548.288630","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

We also show how the notions of retiming and resynthesis can be moderately extended to achieve more powerful state transition graph transformations. Our work will provide theoretical foundation for practical retiming and resynthesis based optimization and verification.","doi":"10.1145/288548.289061","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

The partitioning problem for time multiplexed FPGAs is different from the traditional partitioning problem in that the nodes have precedence constraints among them, and the widely used iterative improvement partitioning methods such as K&L, FM (C.M. Fiduccia and R.M. Mattheyses, 1982; B.W. Kernighan and S. Lin, 1978) are no longer applicable. All later approaches (S. Trimberger, 1998; D. Chang and M.

We present a network flow based algorithm for multi way precedence constrained partitioning, which can handle the precedence constraints while minimizing the net cut size.

In order to prevent test development from becoming the bottleneck in the entire development trajectory, reuse of pre-computed tests for the reusable pre-designed cores is mandatory. The core user is responsible for translating the test at core level into a test at chip level. A standardized test access mechanism eases this task, therefore contributing to the plug-n-play character of core-based design. This paper presents the concept of a structured test access mechanism for embedded cores. Reusable IP modules are wrapped in a TESTSHELL. Test data access from chip pins to TESTSHELL and vice versa is provided by the TESTRAIL, while the operation of the TESTSHELL is controlled by a dedicated test control mechanism (TCM). Both TESTRAIL as well as TCM are standardized, but open for extensions.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1998.743166","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1998 (IEEE Cat.

Unlike existing high-level testing techniques that cater restrictively to certain classes of circuits or design styles, TAO exploits the algebra of regular expressions to provide a unified framework for handling a wide variety of circuits including application-specific integrated circuits, application-specific programmable processors, application-specific instruction processors, digital signal processors and microprocessors. We also augment TAO with a design-for-test framework that can provide a low-cost testability solution by examining the trade-offs in choosing from a diverse array of testability modifications like partial scan or test multiplexer insertion in different parts of the circuit. Test generation is symbolic and, hence, independent of bit-width. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that TAO is very efficient, in addition to being comprehensive. The fault coverage obtained is above 99% in all cases. The average area and delay overheads for incorporating testability into the benchmarks are only 3.3% and 1.1%, respectively. The test application time is comparable to that associated with gate-level sequential test generators.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1998.743171","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1998 (IEEE Cat.

The number of pins available to accommodate scan test is given, as well as the number of scan test patterns and scannable flip flops of each core. We present and analyze three scan chain architectures for core-based ICs, which aim at a minimum test vector set size. We give experimental results of the three architectures for an industrial IC.

A small amount of on-chip circuitry is used to reduce both the test storage and test time required for testing a core-based design. The fully specified test vectors provided by the core vendor are stored in compressed form in the tester memory and transferred to the chip where they are decompressed and applied to the core (the compression is lossless). Instead of having to transfer each entire test vector from the tester to the core, a smaller amount of compressed data is transferred instead. This reduces the amount of test data that must be stored on the tester and hence reduces the total amount of test time required for transferring the data with a given test data bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1998.743186","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1998 (IEEE Cat.

These effects are becoming more prevalent due to short signal switching times and deep submicron circuitry. These noise effects can propagate through a circuit and create a logic error in a latch or at a primary output. We first present a new way for predicting the output waveform produced by an inverter due to a non-square wave pulse at its input. Our modeling technique captures such properties as the amplitude of a pulse and its rise/fall times and the delay through a device. To expedite the computation of the response of a logic gate to an input pulse, we have developed a novel way of modeling such gates by an equivalent inverter. We have developed a mixed-signal test generator that incorporates classical PODEM-like static values as well as dynamic signals such as transitions and pulses, and timing information such as signal arrival times, rise/fall times, and gate delay. We also present a new analog cost function that is used to guide the search process. Comparison of results with SPICE simulations confirms the accuracy of this approach.

This paper proposes a simple and efficient algorithm named edge pixels classification (EPC) algorithm. According to the fact that human eyes are highly sensitive to the motion of the edge, the EPC algorithm makes full use of the pixels in the edge. After edge detection, the pixels in the edge are classified into two categories: matching pixels and mismatching pixels. The best matching block within a search area is the one with the highest number of matching pixels. Compared with some well-known algorithms which use mean absolute difference (MAD) matching criteria, the EPC algorithm can provide much higher performance with much lower computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple and efficient algorithm for block matching motion estimation in video coding","publicationTitle":"ICCT'98. 1998 International Conference on Communication Technology.

Since reconfiguration programming time can dominate total test time, even with slow I/sub DDQ/ vectors, we use a bottom-up test generation approach to minimize the number of programming phases first, and then to minimize the number of test vectors. 100% coverage for I/sub DDQ/-testable bridging faults is achieved in 5 programming phases and 16 I/sub DDQ/ vectors in the Xilinx XC4000 FPGA family. The RAM modes are tested in a further phase, using 48 test vectors and 38 I/sub DDQ/ measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1998.743302","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1998 (IEEE Cat.

Some techniques are limited to a specific fault model, and many will fail in the face of any unmodeled behavior or unexpected data. Others apply ad-hoc or arbitrary scoring mechanisms to fault candidates, making the results difficult to interpret or to compare with the results from other algorithms. This paper outlines an approach to fault diagnosis that is robust, comprehensive, extendable, and practical. By introducing a probabilistic framework for diagnostic prediction, it is designed to incorporate disparate diagnostic algorithms, different sets of data, and a mixture of fault models into a single diagnostic result. Results from diagnosis experiments on a Hewlett-Packard ASIC and FIB inserted defects are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1998.743308","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1998 (IEEE Cat.

A model of architecture for the LUT/RAM module with N inputs and 2/sup N/ memory cells is proposed taking into account the LUT and RAM modes. Concerning the RAM mode, we demonstrate that a unique test configuration is required for a single module. The problem is shown equivalent to the test of a classical SRAM circuit allowing to use existing algorithms such as the march tests. We also propose a unique test configuration called 'pseudo shift register' for mxm arrays of modules. In this configuration, the circuit operates as a shift register and an adapted version of the MATS++ algorithm called 'shifted MATS++' is described. Concerning the LUT mode, we use the concept of non-redundant test that proposes to test in LUT mode the parts of the module not tested in RAM mode. Under this hypothesis, it is demonstrated that the test of a single module as well as the test of an mxm array of modules require only 3 test configurations. Using our solution, the test of a complete array of mxm LUT/RAM modules requires 4 test configurations independently of the size of the array and of the modules.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Test Conference 1998 (IEEE Cat.

Here, we illustrate some techniques for dividers realized in CMOS technology. The energy dissipation reduction is carried out at different levels of abstraction: from the algorithm level down to the implementation, or gate, level. We describe the use of techniques such as switching-off not active blocks, retiming, dual voltage, and equalizing the paths to reduce glitches. Also, we describe modifications in the on-the-fly conversion and rounding algorithm and in the redundant representation of the residual in order to reduce the energy dissipation. The techniques and modifications mentioned above are applied to a radix-4, divider, realized with static CMOS standard cells, for which a reduction of 40 percent is obtained with respect to the standard implementation.

We also give asymptotically tight characterizations of T for all symmetric f in the exact, zero-error, and bounded-error settings. Finally, we give new precise bounds for AND, OR, and PARITY.

Traditional methods like the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) help us find the \"best\" such approximation. However, these methods take time polynomial in m, n which is often too prohibitive. In this paper, we develop an algorithm which is qualitatively faster provided we may sample the entries of the matrix according to a natural probability distribution. Indeed, in the applications such sampling is possible. Our main result is that we can find the description of a matrix D* of rank at most k so that /spl par/A-D*/spl par//sub F//spl les/min/D,rank(D)/spl les/k/spl par/A-D/spl par//sub F/+/spl epsiv//spl par/A/spl par//sub F/ holds with probability at least 1-/spl delta/.

So far the protocol has been proved secure even under channel noise and detector faults of the receiver but is vulnerable if the photon source used is imperfect. In this paper we propose and give a concrete design for a new concept, self-checking source, which requires the manufacturer of the photon source to provide certain tests; these tests are designed such that, if passed, the source is guaranteed to be adequate for the security of the quantum key distribution protocol, even though the testing devices may not be built to the original specification. The main mathematical result is a structural theorem which states that, for any state in a Hilbert space, if certain EPR-type equations are satisfied, the state must be essentially the orthogonal sum of EPR pairs.","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1998.743501","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 39th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (Cat.

We illustrate the technique by studying two simple, intuitively appealing models that are prevalent in the literature: the diffusive paradigm, and periodic balancing circuits (or the dimension exchange paradigm). It is well known that such load balancing schemes can be roughly modeled by Markov chains, but also that this approximation can be quite inaccurate. Our main contribution is an effective way of characterizing the deviation between the actual loads and the distribution generated by a related Markov chain, in terms of a natural quantity which we call the local divergence. We apply this technique to obtain bounds on the number of rounds required to achieve coarse balancing in general networks, cycles and meshes in these models. For balancing circuits, we also present bounds for the stronger requirement of perfect balancing, or counting.","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1998.743520","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 39th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (Cat.

In the proposed method it is assumed that the usual single-rate robust feedback controller such as the disturbance observer or the H/sub /spl infin// controller already exists, and the feedforward controller is obtained by using the multirate sampling control. The advantages of the proposed method are that (1) the controller can be designed without considering the unstable zeros of the discrete-time plant; (2) the states of the plant match the desired trajectories at every sampling point; (3) high robust performance is assured by the robust feedback controller. An illustrative example of position control using a DC servo is presented, and the advantages of this approach are demonstrated both in the time and frequency domain.","doi":"10.1109/AMC.1998.743557","publicationTitle":"AMC'98 - Coimbra. 1998 5th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control.

The design of extenders is different from the design of conventional robots because the extender interfaces with the human on a physical level. Two sets of force sensors measure the forces imposed on the extender by the human and by the environment (i.e., the load). The extender's compliances in response to such contact forces were designed by selecting appropriate force compensators.

Computer based techniques that reduce the need for expensive experimental measurements are invaluable tools for achieving this objective. Various computational algorithms based mainly on ray tracing have emerged in recent years for determining radio coverage. Although the output of these algorithms agrees well with measurement results, execution times remain high. To provide faster computational methods for determining radio coverage, we have developed a fast 3D method of regions (MR) algorithm. This algorithm divides the environment into reflection, transmission, and possibly diffraction regions, then identifies infeasible image combinations and locations affected by similar propagation mechanisms a priori. When implemented on a parallel machine, our algorithm provides close-to-ideal speedups, enabling the fast computation of radio coverage that service providers require.","publicationTitle":"Computing in Science & Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Computing in Science & Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/5992/16026/00743620.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"41","doi":"10.1109/5992.743620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5992.743620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast computational techniques for indoor radio channel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743620/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Fast computational techniques for indoor radio channel estimation","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6164737","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast computational techniques for indoor radio channel estimation","sourcePdf":"00743620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037563S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5992","citationCount":"12","articleId":"743620","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":743622,"authors":[{"name":"T.

With more high bandwidth services becoming available, particularly on the Internet, even more sophisticated coding- and modulation techniques are needed. We have developed a system based on advanced signal processing to meet such needs. The time-frequency-division multiplexing scheme for high bandwidth communications we have developed uses smooth time-frequency divisions for a multiple access fiber optic network. Our modulation scheme makes much better use of the time-frequency plane, while drastically reducing timing jitter and the deleterious effects of dispersion through proper use of orthogonal waveforms.","doi":"10.1109/5992.743622","publicationTitle":"Computing in Science & Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Computing in Science & Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/5992/16026/00743622.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5992.743622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16026","startPage":"51","endPage":"57","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelets in optical communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=743622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelets in optical communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6157879","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelets in optical communications","sourcePdf":"00743622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042253S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5992","citationCount":"6","articleId":"743622","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":743657,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Three main properties of the Human Visual System (HVS) are incorporated into the coder: frequency sensitivity, luminance sensitivity and texture masking. Optimization is implemented in two phases. In the first phase, all wavelet coefficients are weighted by the base frequency sensitivities of the corresponding subbands. In the second stage, local adjustment of the quantizer is achieved by the comparison of a just noticeable distortion (JND) threshold with the current quantizer step size. Values of the JND threshold are calculated at every pixel location using luminance sensitivity and texture masking factors. Only quantized pixel values are used to avoid overhead information and preserve the iterative nature of the algorithm. Our proposed coder has been tested on a set of images. Simulation results show that the superior subjective image quality can be achieved at the same bitrate, compared to the PSNR-optimized encoder.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.1998.743657","publicationTitle":"IEEE.

We consider the effect of the non-identical fading parameter and the RAKE branches using error correcting code on the system performance of a coherent binary phase shift keying (BPSK) RAKE receiver operating in the Nakagami fading channel. The error only decoding and erasure-and-error decoding techniques are used and the lower bounds BER of the post decoding system for RS-codes are obtained. The effect of the non-identical fading parameter makes the BER system performance slightly better than the identical case. The results obtained show that by using error correcting codes, increasing the branches and the identical fading parameter, the BER of coherent DS-CDMA in an arbitrary Nakagami fading channel can be improved significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE.

Simulations have been run for the case of 32-kb/s ADPCM encoded voice across a physical link whose bandwidth is 1/4, 1/2, or 1 times DS1 (1.536 Mb/s). The results show the number of calls that can be admitted while meeting the ninety-ninth percentile queuing delay objective of 20 ms or less. The delay budget that can be allocated to packet queuing delay at access is about 20 ms, given a one-way end-to-end delay budget of 100 to 150 ms for conversational voice. The number of calls is also limited so that the ratio of late or lost packets does not exceed 10/sup -3/. Voice quality is known to be tolerant to packet losses of up to one in 100. When the packet delay variation is significant, as it threatens to be in this situation, sequence numbers can help a receiver to detect and to recover from anomalies-lost, early, or late packets-and make fewer reconstruction errors than if sequence numbers were absent or ignored. Three circumstances are identified where packet slips can occur with ripple effects. An analysis of these cases leads to lower bounds on the sequence number modulus. The appropriate value of the sequence number modulus depends on the desired call load and performance objectives, and can be deduced from the results presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalies due to delay and loss in AAL2 packet voice systems: performance models and methods of mitigation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.743690","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16030/00743690.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.743690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=743690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Anomalies due to delay and loss in AAL2 packet voice systems: performance models and methods of mitigation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6163826","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalies due to delay and loss in AAL2 packet voice systems: performance models and methods of mitigation","sourcePdf":"00743690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050649S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","articleId":"743690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":743701,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This assumption is unrealistic since in a BIST environment a single defect can usually cause hundreds or thousands of errors in a test response sequence. Without making the above assumption, this paper presents a novel BIST fault diagnostic technique for scan-based VLSI devices. Based on faulty signature information, our scheme guarantees correct identification of the scan flip-flops that capture errors during test, regardless of the number of errors the circuit may produce. In addition, it is able to identify failing test vectors with a better diagnostic capacity than existing techniques. The proposed scheme does not assume any specific fault model. Thus, it is applicable to all voltage-detectable faults. It also applies naturally to multifrequency BIST. This paper analyzes the efficiency of the scheme in terms of diagnostic coverage. Experimental results on several large ISCAS89 benchmark circuits and industrial circuits are also reported.","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/16031/00743733.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.743733","doi":"10.1109/43.743733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=743733","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Built-in self-test","Fault diagnosis","Circuit testing","Circuit faults","Very large scale integration","Production","Automatic testing","Error correction","Fabrication","Flip-flops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","VLSI","fault diagnosis","integrated circuit testing","digital integrated circuits","logic testing","flip-flops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scan-based BIST fault diagnosis","built-in self-test diagnostic technique","test response sequence","scan-based VLSI devices","faulty signature information","scan flip-flops identification","failing test vectors","voltage-detectable faults","multifrequency BIST","diagnostic coverage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Scan-based BIST fault diagnosis","accessionNumber":"6169729","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scan-based BIST fault diagnosis","sourcePdf":"00743733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039537S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"44","articleId":"743733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":743744,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

These are linear feedback shift registers (LFSR's) over a Galois field GF(2/sup /spl delta//), (/spl delta/>1). Unlike conventional LFSR's, which are over GF(2), these generators are not equivalent to cellular arrays and are shown to achieve significantly higher fault coverage. Experimental results are presented in this paper depicting that the proposed GLFSR can attain fault coverage equivalent to the LPSR, but with significantly fewer patterns. Specifically, results obtained demonstrate that in combinational circuits, for both stuck-at as well as transition faults, the proposed GLFSR outperforms all conventional pattern generators. Moreover, these experimental results are validated by certain randomness tests which demonstrate that the patterns generated by GLFSR achieve a higher degree of randomless.","doi":"10.1109/43.743744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/16031/00743744.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.743744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GLFSR-a new test pattern generator for built-in-self-test","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"GLFSR-a new test pattern generator for built-in-self-test","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6169733","volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GLFSR-a new test pattern generator for built-in-self-test","sourcePdf":"00743744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059561S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"36","articleId":"743744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":743756,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The implementation of this improved squaring function is based on combinational logic design. The performance of this new approach has been verified by implementing a 7-bit squaring function chip in a 2-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. The active integrated circuit area of the chip was 380/spl times/400 /spl mu/m/sup 2/, and the delays through this area were 5.7 and 3.0 ns for rising and falling edges, respectively. Compared with a previous design, this approach reduces error associated with approximation, simplifies the complexity of realization, reduces the integrated circuit area by at least 40%, and increases the speed by about 100%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Viterbi algorithm","Maximum likelihood decoding","Logic design","CMOS technology","Convolutional codes","Concatenated codes","Testing","Integrated circuit technology","Delay","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","Viterbi decoding","logic design","combinational circuits","VLSI","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational logic design","approximate squaring function","Viterbi algorithm","signal-processing technique","CMOS technology","integrated circuit","2 micron","7 bit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/4.743786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/16032/00743786.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.743786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combinational logic approach for implementing an improved approximate squaring function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=743786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combinational logic approach for implementing an improved approximate squaring function","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743786/","volume":"34","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6164787","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combinational logic approach for implementing an improved approximate squaring function","sourcePdf":"00743786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038288S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"17","articleId":"743786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":743787,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Chin Jiang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsin-Chin Jiang","id":"37331304100"},{"name":"Chung-Yu Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Yu Wu","id":"37276423000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"743787","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Retina","Delay","Image edge detection","CMOS technology","Semiconductor device measurement","Motion detection","Detectors","Image sensors","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","intelligent sensors","detector circuits","correlators","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","velocity measurement","VLSI","image processing equipment","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D velocity-selective sensor","2D direction-selective sensor","BJT-based silicon retina","temporal zero-crossing detector","visual motion sensor","bipolar junction transistor","token-based delay/correlate computational algorithm","moving object images","binary pulsed signals","compact detection cell architecture","current-input edge extractor","delay paths","correlators","CMOS technology","0.6 micron","56 mm/s to 5 m/s","20 mW","5 V"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a 2-D velocity- and direction-selective visual motion sensor with a bipolar junction transistor (BJT)-based silicon retina and temporal zero-crossing detector is proposed and implemented.

A design technique is developed for the cavity-backed slot antenna using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The technique is effective in characterizing antenna performance such as the input impedance and the far-field pattern since it takes into account the geometry of the feeder as well as the cavity. We present a method that overcomes difficulties when the FDTD method is used to design the antenna. Moreover, we discuss how to determine the calculation parameters used in the FDTD analysis. Several numerical results are presented, along with measured data, which demonstrate the validity, efficiency, and capability of the techniques. The paper proposes a new prediction method for the frequency characteristics of the cavity-backed slot antenna, which applies computational windows to time-sequence data. It is emphasized that windowing the slow decaying signal enables the extraction of accurate antenna characteristics. We also discuss how to estimate the antenna patterns when we use a sinusoidal voltage excitation.","doi":"10.1109/8.743823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/16033/00743823.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.743823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16033","startPage":"1853","endPage":"1858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of cavity-backed slot antennas using the finite-difference time-domain technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=743823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of cavity-backed slot antennas using the finite-difference time-domain technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","accessionNumber":"6164803","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of cavity-backed slot antennas using the finite-difference time-domain technique","sourcePdf":"00743823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05895S","chronDate":"Dec 1998","isNumber":"16033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"24","articleId":"743823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":743828,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This statement is only true if too few snapshots are used to estimate the interference subspace. For Hung-Turner projections the use of more snapshots than the rank of the interference is called \"averaging over the dimension\". The authors implicitly and wrongly claim that even with \"averaging over the dimension\", Hung-Turner projections perform poorly in the presence of wide-band interference. In this comment, we show theoretically and by simulation that Hung-Turner projections adequately suppress wide-band jammers if the number of snapshots is equal to or larger than the rank of the interference. Here, the same sensor array processing model and assumptions are used. Gershman et al. reply that they proposed a new modification of the Hung-Turner (HT) algorithm improving the robustness of this algorithm against wide-band and moving jammers. They also add that their approach can be applied to other adaptive array algorithms as well, and the critical comment contains a misinterpretation of their results and conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/8.743845","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/16033/00743845.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.743845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1897","endPage":"1899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comment on \"Constrained Hung-Turner adaptive beamforming algorithm with additional robustness to wide-band and moving jammers\" [with reply]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=743845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Comment on \"Constrained Hung-Turner adaptive beamforming algorithm with additional robustness to wide-band and moving jammers\" [with reply]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743845/","volume":"46","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","accessionNumber":"6164813","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comment on \"Constrained Hung-Turner adaptive beamforming algorithm with additional robustness to wide-band and moving jammers\" [with reply]","sourcePdf":"00743845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084298S","chronDate":"Dec.  1998","isNumber":"16033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"4","articleId":"743845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":743851,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Jong Choi","affiliation":["Center for Processing Research and the Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA","DTV Team, Digital Media Laboratory, LG Electronics, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Jong Choi","id":"37087370535"},{"name":"J.W.

In this new system, spatio-temporal subbands are generated by MC temporal analysis and a spatial wavelet transform, and then encoded by 3-D subband-finite state scalar quantization (3DSB-FSSQ). The rate allocation from the GOP level to each class of subbands is optimized by utilizing the structural property of MC-3DSBC that additive superposition approximately holds for both rate and distortion. The proposed video coding system is applied to several test video clips. Its performance exceeds that of both a known MPEG-1 implementation and a similar subband MC predictive coder while maintaining modest computational complexity and memory size.","doi":"10.1109/83.743851","startPage":"155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/16029/00743851.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.743851","endPage":"167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion-compensated 3-D subband coding of video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Motion-compensated 3-D subband coding of video","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6173145","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","pubMedId":"18267464","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion-compensated 3-D subband coding of video","sourcePdf":"00743851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034308S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"284","articleId":"743851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":743853,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Specifically, MPEG-2 compatible discrete cosine transform (DCT) intraframe coding is addressed. The aim of this work is twofold: first, to provide a theoretical analysis of the transcoding problem, and second, to derive quantization methods for efficient transcoding based on the results of the analysis. The mean squared error (MSE) cost function is proposed for designing a quantizer with minimum distortion resulting in up to 1.3 dB gain compared with the quantizer used in the MPEG-2 reference coder TM5. However, the MSE quantizer leads in general to a larger bit rate and may therefore only be applied locally to blocks of sensitive image content. A better rate-distortion performance can be provided by the maximum a posteriori (MAP) cost function. In critical cases, the MAP quantizer gives a 0.4 dB larger signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the same bit rate compared with the TM5 quantizer. The results are not limited to MPEG-2 and can be adapted to other coding schemes such as H.263 or JPEG.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6166550","pubMedId":"18267466","displayDocTitle":"Requantization for transcoding of MPEG-2 intraframes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Requantization for transcoding of MPEG-2 intraframes","sourcePdf":"00743853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060587S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"71","articleId":"743853","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":743854,"authors":[{"name":"E.H.W.

From sampling theory, it is well known that the sine-function is the ideal interpolation kernel which, however, cannot be used in practice. In order to be able to obtain an acceptable reconstruction, both in terms of computational speed and mathematical precision, it is required to design a kernel that is of finite extent and resembles the sinc-function as much as possible. In this paper, the applicability of the sine-approximating symmetrical piecewise nth-order polynomial kernels is investigated in satisfying these requirements. After the presentation of the general concept, kernels of first, third, fifth and seventh order are derived. An objective, quantitative evaluation of the reconstruction capabilities of these kernels is obtained by analyzing the spatial and spectral behavior using different measures, and by using them to translate, rotate, and magnify a number of real-life test images. From the experiments, it is concluded that while the improvement of cubic convolution over linear interpolation is significant, the use of higher order polynomials only yields marginal improvement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image reconstruction by convolution with symmetrical piecewise nth-order polynomial kernels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.743854","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/16029/00743854.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.743854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=743854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/743854/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Image reconstruction by convolution with symmetrical piecewise nth-order polynomial kernels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6166551","pubMedId":"18267467","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image reconstruction by convolution with symmetrical piecewise nth-order polynomial kernels","sourcePdf":"00743854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062503S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"62","articleId":"743854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":743855,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Recent developments in these areas have not only renovated the theory of digital signal processing, they have also resulted in new tools that find applications in various domains. For instance, multirate signal processing has triggered recent advances in modem technology and speech/audio coding; adaptive filtering has made echo cancellation and noise suppression possible; time-frequency analysis has found its way into various applications in radar and medical signal processing; and non-linear processing has made engineers rethink various problems in speech recognition and image analysis.

The computation of the 2-D DTT is based on the row-column decomposition approach. However, in contrast to previous schemes, efficient and unrestricted Clenshaw's recurrence formula along with the inherent symmetry of the trigonometric functions are adequately employed to render efficient recurrences for computing both of the row and column transforms. As such, the resulting VLSI architecture not only provides substantial hardware savings as compared with previous works, but it can also be applied to the 2-D DTT of arbitrary size. An input buffer along with a bidirectional circular shift matrix are addressed as well to enable the architecture to operate in a fully-pipelined manner.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified fully-pipelined VLSI implementations of two-dimensional discrete trigonometric transforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE.

In this proposed motion estimation scheme, the sign truncated feature (STF) is defined and used for block matching, as opposed to the pixel intensity values used in the conventional block matching methods. Using the STF definition, a data block can be presented by a mean and a set of binary features with a much reduced data set. The block matching motion estimation is then divided to mean matching and binary phase matching. The proposed technique enables a significant reduction in computational complexity compared with the conventional full-search block matching ME because binary phase matching only involves Boolean logic operations. This scheme also significantly reduces the data transfer time between the frame buffer and motion estimator. Our test results indicate that the performance of the proposed scheme is comparable with the full-search block matching under the same search ranges, however, the proposed scheme can be implemented about 64 times faster than the conventional full-search scheme.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.1998.743900","publicationTitle":"IEEE.

This paper demonstrates that correlated double sampling (CDS), which has traditionally been used to remove the amplifier offset and attenuate the 1/f noise, can be extended to cancel the kT/C noise and the switch charge injection due to switching operations.

An instance of behavior modeling, homing behavior, is discussed and formulated into a logical design. From the logical design we use the schematic capture and supporting software to simulate, refine, and synthesize the logic gates. The gate list is finally mapped onto the FPGA devices using Xilinx synthesis tools. Results indicate that the control chip performs the homing behavior correctly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE.

In order to overcome this problem, a two-terminal integrated circuit temperature transducer is connected to the system, and its temperature information is used to correct the temperature drift error of the magnetic sensor.

It consists of integrated digital time-interval measurement electronics with a /spl plusmn/10-ns resolution that can be improved to /spl plusmn/10 ps by an analog interpolation method. Identical construction of the interpolation electronics leads to stable performance of the TDC. The drifts of all six TDC units remain within /spl plusmn/10 ps over a temperature range from -10/spl deg/C to +50/spl deg/C. The stability can be improved further by a real-time calibration procedure developed here. The single-shot precision of the TDC is better than 15 ps (standard deviation), but precision can be improved to below 0.1 ps by averaging about 10 000 measurements at the maximum measurement speed of 100 kHz. The time range of the TDC is currently 2.55 /spl mu/s, but this can be increased by adding an external digital counter. The TDC suffers from a periodic nonlinearity over the measured time range from 0 to 1.3 /spl mu/s, the amplitude and period of the nonlinearity being /spl plusmn/20 ps and 40 ns, respectively. The reason lies in the integrated digital part of the electronics. The linearity of interpolation in the 10-ns time range improves, however, as more results are averaged.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744201/","volume":"47","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6178278","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A high-precision time-to-digital converter for pulsed time-of-flight laser radar applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-precision time-to-digital converter for pulsed time-of-flight laser radar applications","sourcePdf":"00744201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086771S","chronDate":"Apr 1998","isNumber":"16078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"81","articleId":"744201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":744205,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A generalized model of the IM induced by an arbitrary number of channels through XPM is derived, compared to simulation results and its validity range is presented. Results show that the XPM-induced IM can be modeled as an intensity modulator driven by the intensity of copropagating waves. The frequency response of the intensity modulator corresponding to each copropagating wave is mainly affected by the walk-off parameter and fiber dispersion. When the walk-off effect is weak the XPM-induced IM is approximately proportional to the square frequency. In single-segment fiber links when the walk-off effect is strong the XPM-induced IM is approximately linearly proportional to the frequency and inversely proportional to the wavelength separation. Both theory and simulation show that the XPM-induced IM in fiber links with multiple optical amplifiers can be enhanced or reduced by properly arranging the dispersion characteristics in each fiber segment. In a nondispersion compensated amplified link and for weak walk-off effect, the total XPM-induced IM increases approximately with the square of the number of fiber segments and of modulation frequency. However, if the dispersion is compensated for within each fiber segment the total XPM-induced IM increases proportionally to the number of fiber segments and to the square frequency. Furthermore, it is shown that in fiber links with a large number of segments placing a single dispersion compensator in the last segment of the link leads to almost the same performance as for non dispersion compensated fiber link and is significantly worse than placing one dispersion compensator in each fiber segment as far as the XPM-induced IM reduction is concerned.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-phase modulation in intensity modulation-direct detection WDM systems with multiple optical amplifiers and dispersion compensators","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.744218","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/50/16073/00744218.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.744218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Cross-phase modulation in intensity modulation-direct detection WDM systems with multiple optical amplifiers and dispersion compensators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6170700","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-phase modulation in intensity modulation-direct detection WDM systems with multiple optical amplifiers and dispersion compensators","sourcePdf":"00744218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052843S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"117","articleId":"744218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":744225,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

However, the finite gain recovery time of the semiconductor optical amplifier causes distortion and pattern dependence at high bit rates. Here we show that filtering the output of a semiconductor optical amplifier wavelength converter with the transmission edge of a fiber grating filter improves its frequency response. The grating sharpens the transition between the bits by converting the phase modulation at the edge to useful amplitude modulation. We determine the filtering condition that produces the optimum frequency response and reduces bit-pattern dependence for nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) data. For small modulation, the apparent frequency response increases by the linewidth enhancement factor /spl alpha//sub H/ of the SOA. In this case, pattern dependence is eliminated completely by the fiber grating filter. For large modulation, pattern dependence can be substantially reduced, but not completely eliminated. We show that after spectral filtering, the residual pattern dependence of an SOA depends only on modulation depth. For a given SOA, we find the optimum grating for minimum conversion penalty at 12 Gb/s for a wide range of operating parameters. Using a fiber grating filter reduces the required optical power for conversion in a semiconductor optical amplifier.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency response","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical fiber filters","Optical wavelength conversion","Optical distortion","Optical modulation","Filtering","Fiber gratings","Stimulated emission","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor optical amplifiers","wavelength division multiplexing","optical transmitters","Bragg gratings","optical fibre filters","optimisation","frequency response","optical frequency conversion","phase modulation","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","frequency response","semiconductor optical amplifier wavelength converter output filtering","fiber Bragg grating","cross-gain modulation","all-optical wavelength conversion","finite gain recovery time","pattern dependence","high bit rates","phase modulation","amplitude modulation","filtering condition","nonreturn-to-zero data","fiber grating filter","spectral filtering","optimum grating","minimum conversion penalty","12 Gbit/s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.744241","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/50/16073/00744241.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.744241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of the frequency response of a semiconductor optical amplifier wavelength converter using a fiber Bragg grating","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of the frequency response of a semiconductor optical amplifier wavelength converter using a fiber Bragg grating","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744241/","volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6177573","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of the frequency response of a semiconductor optical amplifier wavelength converter using a fiber Bragg grating","sourcePdf":"00744241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030388S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"31","articleId":"744241","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":744257,"authors":[{"name":"S.

While the object-based motion compensation is performed in the first stage, the second-stage motion compensation is carried out to search the best match of the contours, which are not motion compensated in the first stage. Also by introducing the notion of the error band, the current contours can be properly fitted to the motion compensated contours using the interframe relationship of the contours. In addition, an efficient technique for encoding the contours, simplified by the majority filter, is also proposed. From the simulation result, it is shown that the proposed technique provides better performance than the content-based arithmetic encoding, especially when lossy encoding is allowed. Moreover, by varying the width N of the error band, it is shown that the bit amount for the shape information can be adjusted according to the channel condition.","doi":"10.1109/76.744275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/16072/00744275.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.744275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16072","startPage":"59","endPage":"69","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coding technique for the contours in smoothly perfect eight-connectivity based on two-stage motion compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A coding technique for the contours in smoothly perfect eight-connectivity based on two-stage motion compensation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744275/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6180299","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coding technique for the contours in smoothly perfect eight-connectivity based on two-stage motion compensation","sourcePdf":"00744275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048066S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"4","articleId":"744275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":744276,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The long-term memory covers several seconds of decoded frames at the encoder and decoder. The use of multiple frames for motion compensation in most cases provides significantly improved prediction gain. The variable time delay has to be transmitted as side information requiring an additional bit rate which may be prohibitive when the size of the long-term memory becomes too large. Therefore, me control the bit rate of the motion information by employing rate constrained motion estimation. Simulation results are obtained by integrating long-term memory prediction into an H.263 codec. Reconstruction PSNR improvements up to 2 dB for the Foreman sequence and 1.5 dB for the Mother-Daughter sequence are demonstrated in comparison to the TMN-2.0 H.263 coder. The PSNR improvements correspond to bit-rate savings up to 34 and 30%, respectively. Mathematical inequalities are used to speed up motion estimation while achieving full prediction gain.","doi":"10.1109/76.744276","startPage":"70","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/16072/00744276.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.744276","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term memory motion-compensated prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Long-term memory motion-compensated prediction","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6180300","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term memory motion-compensated prediction","sourcePdf":"00744276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06439S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"216","articleId":"744276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":744277,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Thus, we introduce a new framework of preceding techniques based on the concepts of partitioning, aggregation, and conditional coding (PACC). Our experimental results show that our PACC coder outperforms the VM (Version 5.1) of MPEG4 both for the coding of intraframes (1-2 dB PSNR) and residual frames (up to 1.5 dB PSNR) of typical MPEG4 test sequences. The subjective quality of reconstructed video is, in general, superior to that obtained from the VM implementation. In addition, when restricted to the intraframe mode, the proposed coding algorithm produces results which are among the best reported for still image compression.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/16072/00744277.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very low bit-rate video coding using wavelet-based techniques","doi":"10.1109/76.744277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.744277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Very low bit-rate video coding using wavelet-based techniques","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6180301","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very low bit-rate video coding using wavelet-based techniques","sourcePdf":"00744277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050035S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"54","articleId":"744277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":744279,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Shen","affiliation":["Video and Image Processing Laboratory (VIPER), School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Ke Shen","id":"37087260018"},{"name":"E.J.

An adaptive motion compensation (AMC) scheme is described to address error propagation problems. We show that, using our AMC scheme, the quality of the decoded video can be maintained at various data rates. We also describe an EZW approach that exploits the interdependency between color components in the luminance/chrominance color space. We show that, in addition to providing a wide range of rate scalability, our encoder achieves comparable performance to the more traditional hybrid video coders, such as MPEG1 and H.263.

In these applications, the delay produced by bits accumulated in the encoder buffer must be very small, typically below 100 ms, and the rate control strategy is responsible for encoding the video with high quality and maintaining a low buffer delay. In this work, we present a simple rate control technique that achieves these two objectives by smartly selecting the values of the quantization parameters in typical discrete cosine transform video coders. To do this, we derive models for bit rate and distortion in this type of coders, in terms of the quantization parameters. Using Lagrange optimization, we minimize distortion subject to the target bit constraint, and obtain formulas that indicate how to choose the quantization parameters. We implement our technique in H.263 and MPEG-4 coders, and compare its performance to TMN7 and VM7 rate control when the encoder buffer is small, for a variety of video sequences and bit rates. This new method has been adopted as a rate control tool in the test model TMN8 of H.263+ and (with some modifications) in the verification model VM8 of MPEG-4.","doi":"10.1109/76.744284","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"172","endPage":"185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/16072/00744284.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.744284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate control in DCT video coding for low-delay communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system control","Discrete cosine transforms","Video coding","MPEG 4 Standard","Quantization","Video compression","Delay","Bit rate","Communication standards","Standards development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","telecommunication standards","discrete cosine transforms","transform coding","telecommunication control","image enhancement","delays","buffer storage","optimisation","interference suppression","rate distortion theory","code standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate control","DCT video coding","low-delay communications","H.263+","MPEG-4 coding standard","highly compressed video","two-way real-time communications","encoder buffer","buffer delay","quantization parameters","discrete cosine transform video coders","bit rate","distortion","Lagrange optimization","video sequences","TMN8","VM8","verification model","test model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Rate control in DCT video coding for low-delay communications","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6180308","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744284/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate control in DCT video coding for low-delay communications","sourcePdf":"00744284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041842S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"447","articleId":"744284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":744285,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The implementation is a nontrivial extension of the MPEG-4 rate control algorithm for single video objects which employs a quadratic rate quantizer model. The algorithm is organized into two stages: a pre- and a post-encoding stage. In the pre-encoding stage, an initial target estimate is made for each object. Based on the buffer fullness, the total target is adjusted and then distributed proportional to the relative size, motion, and variance of each object. Based on the new individual targets and rate-quantizer relation for texture, appropriate quantization parameters are calculated. After each object is encoded, the model parameters for each object are updated, and if necessary, frames are skipped to ensure that the buffer does not overflow. A preframeskip control is exercised to avoid buffer overflow when the motion and shape information occupies a significant portion of the bit budget. The rate control algorithm switches between two operation modes so that the coder can reduce the spatial coding accuracy for an improved temporal resolution. A shape-coding control mechanism is also proposed, which provides a tradeoff between texture and shape coding accuracy. Overall, the algorithm is able to successfully achieve the target bit rate, effectively code arbitrarily shaped objects, and maintain a stable buffer level. These techniques have been adopted by the MPEG committee in July 1997 as part of the video verification model (VM8).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.744285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16072","startPage":"186","endPage":"199","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/16072/00744285.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPEG-4 rate control for multiple video objects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"MPEG-4 rate control for multiple video objects","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6180309","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPEG-4 rate control for multiple video objects","sourcePdf":"00744285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072168S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"181","articleId":"744285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":744291,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

Ring topology can be often found in the hybrid microwave integrated-circuit design of narrow and broad-band integrated couplers and mixers. In this paper, we propose a new design theory using a phase inverter for systematic size reduction and band broadening of a uniplanar hybrid ring coupler. The features and design criteria of broad-band reverse-phase hybrid ring couplers are presented. Effective bandwidth of a new reverse-phase hybrid ring coupler can be increased by 28% with a return loss of 20 dB. In addition, we present a class of uniplanar phase inverters and discuss their technical aspects. Experimental results show that the bandwidth of the proposed phase inverter is greater than 1.9 octaves with insertion loss below 1 dB and phase shift error of less than /spl plusmn/20/spl deg/. Measurements confirm that the new uniplanar hybrid ring coupler provides attractive features. Its isolation is better than 20 dB over a 1.8-octave bandwidth attributed to the phase inverter providing almost a frequency-independent phase shift.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel4/22/16071/00744295.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.744295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.744295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Size-reduction and band-broadening design technique of uniplanar hybrid ring coupler using phase inverter for M(H)MIC's","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Inverters","Coupling circuits","Radio frequency","Millimeter wave technology","Radiofrequency integrated circuits","Phased arrays","Microstrip","Microwave theory and techniques","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMIC","hybrid integrated circuits","microwave integrated circuits","waveguide couplers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["size reduction","band broadening","uniplanar hybrid ring coupler","phase inverter","MMIC","HMIC","design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Size-reduction and band-broadening design technique of uniplanar hybrid ring coupler using phase inverter for M(H)MIC's","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6184872","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Size-reduction and band-broadening design technique of uniplanar hybrid ring coupler using phase inverter for M(H)MIC's","sourcePdf":"00744295.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030446S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"99","articleId":"744295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":744297,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

However, an accurate characterization of such a component is needed in order to develop efficient computer-aided-design programs. In this paper, a hybrid planar integrated circuit comprising an NRD resonator is accurately modeled and is coupled to input and output planar microstrip circuits by means of long slots located on the top ground plane of the NRD structure. A reciprocity approach is used to solve the coupling problem between the resonator and microstrip lines. A modal expansion of the field equations has been applied to the NRD resonator in obtaining its rigorous field expressions. Finally, a transmission-line analysis is proposed for the structure, and scattering parameters have been calculated for different slot positions.

Using a value prediction scheme, an instruction's computed value is predicted during the fetch stage and forwarded to all dependent instructions to speed up execution. Value prediction schemes have been based on a local context by predicting values using the values generated by the same instruction. This paper presents techniques that predict values of an instruction based on a global context where the behavior of other instructions is used in prediction. The global context includes the path along which an instruction is executed and the values computed by other previously completed instructions. We present techniques that augment conventional last value and stride predictors with global context information. Experiments performed using path-based techniques with realistic table sizes resulted in an increase in prediction of 6.4-8.4% over the current prediction schemes. Prediction using values computed by other instructions resulted in a further improvement of 7.2% prediction accuracy over the best path-based predictor.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6021/16082/00744311.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1999.744311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1999.744311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global context-based value prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided instruction","History","Parallel processing","Computer science","Concurrent computing","Accuracy","Computer architecture","Data mining","Hardware","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel programming","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global context-based value prediction","data dependencies","programs","instruction computed value prediction","fetch stage","dependent instructions","execution speed-up","instruction execution path","last value predictors","stride predictors","global context information","table sizes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Global context-based value prediction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6169073","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-13 Jan. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global context-based value prediction","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00744311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036563S","chronDate":"9-13 Jan 1999","isNumber":"16082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6021","citationCount":"36","articleId":"744311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":744314,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Many integer problems, however, rarely need the full 64 bit dynamic range these CPUs provide. In fact, another recent instruction set trend has been increased support for sub-word operations (that is, manipulating data in quantities less than the full word size). In particular, most major processor families have introduced \"multimedia\" instruction set extensions that operate in parallel on several sub-word quantities in the same ALU. This paper notes that across the SPECint95 benchmarks, over half of the integer operation executions require 16 bits or less. With this as motivation, our work proposes hardware mechanisms that dynamically recognize and capitalize on these \"narrow-bitwidth\" instances. Both optimizations require little additional hardware, and neither requires compiler support. The first, power-oriented, optimization reduces processor power consumption by using aggressive clock gating to turn off portions of integer arithmetic units that will be unnecessary for narrow bitwidth operations. This optimization results in an over 50% reduction in the integer unit's power consumption for the SPECint95 and MediaBench benchmark suites. The second optimization improves performance by merging together narrow integer operations and allowing them to share a single functional unit. Conceptually akin to a dynamic form of MMX, this optimization offers speedups of 4.3%-6.2% for SPECint95 and 8.0%-10.4% for MediaBench.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6021/16082/00744314.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1999.744314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1999.744314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamically exploiting narrow width operands to improve processor power and performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming profession","Program processors","Microprocessors","Energy consumption","Dynamic range","Electronic switching systems","Merging","Sun","Instruction sets","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instruction sets","parallel processing","performance evaluation","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic narrow width operand exploitation","processor power improvement","performance improvement","general-purpose microprocessors","addressing needs","integer problems","64 bit word widths","CPUs","instruction set","sub-word operations","multimedia instruction set extensions","ALU","hardware mechanisms","power-oriented optimization","aggressive clock gating","MediaBench benchmark suite","SPECint95 benchmark suite","64 bit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Dynamically exploiting narrow width operands to improve processor power and performance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6169074","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-13 Jan. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically exploiting narrow width operands to improve processor power and performance","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00744314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118065S","chronDate":"9-13 Jan 1999","isNumber":"16082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6021","citationCount":"171","articleId":"744314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":744318,"authors":[{"name":"L.W.

A typical time-stamp counter utilizes a digital divider to reduce signal frequency to the desired sample rate. Unfortunately, division also reduces phase modulation to the point where useful information may be obscured by counter measurement uncertainty (jitter). An analogy between an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a time-stamp counter predicts that the counter induced modulation can be modeled as random noise which is white in phase. The noise magnitude is directly related to the instrument's resolution specification. Fourier analysis, subject to some restrictions, can compute the power spectra of phase or frequency modulation, revealing even low level responses. A number of techniques can be used to reduce the amount of counter induced noise that appears on time domain plots of phase and frequency modulation. Experimental data, generated by a prototype counter, illustrates the type of results that can be expected from Fourier analysis and various noise reduction techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"6178297","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing time-stamp counter phase modulation measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing time-stamp counter phase modulation measurements","sourcePdf":"00744318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046642S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"16070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"2","articleId":"744318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":744320,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

First, Impulse supports application-specific optimizations through configurable physical address remapping. By remapping physical addresses, applications control how their data is accessed and cached, improving their cache and bus utilization. Second, Impulse supports prefetching at the memory controller, which can hide much of the latency of DRAM accesses. In this paper we describe the design of the Impulse architecture, and show how an Impulse memory system can be used to improve the performance of memory-bound programs. For the NAS conjugate gradient benchmark, Impulse improves performance by 67%. Because it requires no modification to processor, cache, or bus designs, Impulse can be adopted in conventional systems. In addition to scientific applications, we expect that Impulse will benefit regularly strided memory-bound applications of commercial importance, such as database and multimedia programs.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1999.744334","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6021/16082/00744334.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1999.744334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16082","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","startPage":"70","endPage":"79","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"9-13 Jan. 1999","displayDocTitle":"Impulse: building a smarter memory controller","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6169081","publicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Jan 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulse: building a smarter memory controller","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00744334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069389S","chronDate":"9-13 Jan 1999","isNumber":"16082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6021","citationCount":"101","articleId":"744334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":744337,"authors":[{"name":"S.I.

Streaming computations (such as multimedia or scientific applications) are among those whose performance is most limited by the memory bottleneck. Rambus hopes to bridge the processor/memory performance gap with a recently introduced DRAM that can deliver up to 1.6 Gbytes/sec. We analyze the performance of these interesting new memory devices on the inner loops of streaming computations, both for traditional memory controllers that treat all DRAM transactions as random cacheline accesses, and for controllers augmented with streaming hardware. For our benchmarks, we find that accessing unit-stride streams in cacheline bursts in the natural order of the computation exploits from 44-76% of the peak bandwidth of a memory system composed of a single Direct RDRAM device, and that accessing streams via a streaming mechanism with a simple access ordering scheme can improve performance by factors of 1.18 to 2.25.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.1999.744337","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.1999.744337","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6021/16082/00744337.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Fifth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Access order and effective bandwidth for streams on a Direct Rambus memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Access order and effective bandwidth for streams on a Direct Rambus memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Jan 1999","conferenceDate":"9-13 Jan. 1999","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6169082","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Access order and effective bandwidth for streams on a Direct Rambus memory","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00744337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05947S","chronDate":"9-13 Jan 1999","isNumber":"16082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6021","citationCount":"38","articleId":"744337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":744344,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

The CETS, which has been used to transfer up to 5 kW across a 10 mm gap, employs high-frequency magnetic coupling and enables plug-in power connections to be made in wet or hazardous environmental conditions without the risk of electric shock, short circuiting, or sparking. Energy may be transmitted without the necessity for accurately manufactured \"plug-and-socket\" mechanisms and may be transmitted from source to load, even when there is relative motion.

A three-phase balanced induction motor is assumed. Measurements of the stator currents and voltages are required for the identification procedure, but no measurements from the motor shaft are needed. The first method presented applies simple models with limited temporal domains of validity and obtains parameter estimates by extrapolating the model error bias to zero. This method does not minimize any specific error criterion and is presented as a means of finding a good initial guess for a conventional iterative maximum-likelihood or least-squares estimator. The second method presented minimizes equation errors in the induction motor model in the least-square sense using a Levenburg-Marquardt iteration. The third identification method is a continuation of the Levenburg-Marquardt method, motivated by observed properties of some pathological loss functions. The third method minimizes errors in the observations in the least-squared sense and is, therefore, a maximum-likelihood estimator under appropriate conditions of normality. The performance of the identification schemes is demonstrated with both simulated and measured data, and parameters obtained using the methods are compared with parameters obtained from standard tests.","doi":"10.1109/41.744405","pdfPath":"/iel4/41/16068/00744405.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.744405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of induction motor parameters from transient stator current measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Identification of induction motor parameters from transient stator current measurements","volume":"46","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6169953","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of induction motor parameters from transient stator current measurements","sourcePdf":"00744405.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040759S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"72","articleId":"744405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":744406,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The cross-coupling effects in the SynRM model and the torque nonlinearity due to the iron losses in torque-speed characteristics of the SynRM are discussed. The criterion for the efficiency optimization is also introduced and investigated. Since the proposed nonlinear controller directly regulates the torque by selecting the product of d- and q-axes torque currents as one of the output variables, the nonlinear and cross-coupling aspects between the d-and q-axes torque currents and the terminal currents can he eliminated. Hence, the linear torque-speed characteristic can be achieved. In addition, by controlling the power loss-minimizing criterion directly, the proposed controller can optimize the efficiency of the SynRM without deteriorating the dynamics performance.","doi":"10.1109/41.744411","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"192","endPage":"198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/41/16068/00744411.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.744411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency-optimized direct torque control of synchronous reluctance motor using feedback linearization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Reluctance motors","Feedback","Induction motors","Rotors","Current control","Performance loss","Stators","Induction machines","AC motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reluctance motors","machine control","feedback","linearisation techniques","torque control","losses","machine theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficiency-optimized direct torque control","synchronous reluctance motor","feedback linearization","high dynamic torque regulation","efficiency optimization","input-output feedback linearization","cross-coupling effects","torque nonlinearity","iron losses","torque-speed characteristics","nonlinear controller","q-axis torque current","d-axis torque current","terminal currents","linear torque-speed characteristic","power loss-minimizing criterion control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency-optimized direct torque control of synchronous reluctance motor using feedback linearization","volume":"46","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6169959","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744411/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency-optimized direct torque control of synchronous reluctance motor using feedback linearization","sourcePdf":"00744411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032901S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"54","articleId":"744411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":744412,"authors":[{"name":"Han Ding","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Centre for Intelligent Design, Automation and Manufacturing,  Faculty of Science and Technology, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Han Ding","id":"37277756100"},{"name":"S.K.

For real-time implementation, we transform the proposed method into a computation of a recurrent neural network. At each time step, the neural network is adopted for both the solution of the least-norm joint acceleration and the determination of the optimum null space acceleration vector.

This paper describes, from a practical standpoint, the design of a custom hardware accelerator for speeding up the moment computation. The design of the core functional units and the design of the overall system based on a wavefront array architecture are discussed. The moment accelerator can be easily configured into different sizes to meet diverse application requirements cost effectively. Testing results based on implementation using field-programmable gate array devices show that, at an affordable cost, the proposed hardware accelerator can deliver real-time speeds for moment computation.

In many AUV applications, artificial beacons are employed for long duration positioning, or Global Positioning System (GPS) data are used to provide navigation resets. There are numerous missions where these constraints are undesirable and it is the aim of CML to provide relative position by extracting information from the environment through which it is moving. A technique for CML using a multibeam FLS is presented. The method is based on forming objects based on compact regions of high-level bottom backscatter, extracting features from the objects to identify/label them to aid in the data association process, and using the objects in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). A simplified approach to the EKF is used, whereby a new and separate filter is initiated for each new object encountered. Vehicle position is then derived as a weighted sum of the outputs from the individual filters. This approach has been developed and tested using data collected with an advanced FLS referred to as the high resolution array (HRA).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sonar navigation","Global Positioning System","Data mining","Feature extraction","Vehicles","Backscatter","Filters","Sonar measurements","Acoustic testing","Inertial navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater vehicles","mobile robots","computerised navigation","sonar signal processing","feature extraction","Kalman filters","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mapping","localization","CML","forward look sonar","forward-looking sonar","AUV","multibeam FLS","compact regions","high-level bottom backscatter","feature extraction","extended Kalman filter","EKF","vehicle position","high resolution array","HRA"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUV.1998.744449","startPage":"133","endPage":"148","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 Workshop on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (Cat.

Hydro watershed scheduling problems are difficult to solve because many constraints, continuous and discrete, including hydraulic coupling of cascaded reservoirs have to be considered. Restricted or forbidden operating zones as well as minimum generation limits of hydro units result in discontinuous preferred operating regions, and hinder direct applications of efficient continuous optimization methods such as network flow algorithms. Discharge ramping constraints due to navigational, environmental and recreational requirements in a hydro system add another dimension of difficulty since they couple generation or water discharge across time horizon. Integrated consideration of the above constraints is very challenging. The key idea of this paper is to use additional sets of multipliers to relax discontinuous operating region and discharge ramping constraints on individual hydro units so that a two-level optimization structure is formed. The low level consists of a continuous discharge scheduling subproblem determining the generation levels of all units in the entire watershed, and a number of pure integer scheduling subproblems determining the hydro operating states, one for each unit. The discharge subproblem is solved by a network flow algorithm, and the integer scheduling problems are solved by dynamic programming with a small number of states and well-structured transitions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.744500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/59/16090/00744500.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"131","doi":"10.1109/59.744500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling hydro power systems with restricted operating zones and discharge ramping constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling hydro power systems with restricted operating zones and discharge ramping constraints","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6165376","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling hydro power systems with restricted operating zones and discharge ramping constraints","sourcePdf":"00744500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036113S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"66","articleId":"744500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":744505,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A Sugeno type fuzzy inference system is used in the proposed controller. The Sugeno type fuzzy inference system is extremely well suited to the task of smoothly interpolating linear gains across the input space when a very nonlinear system moves around in its operating space. The proposed adaptive controller requires much less training patterns than a neural net based adaptive scheme does and hence avoiding excessive training time. Results of simulation show that the proposed adaptive fuzzy controller offers better performance than fixed gain controllers at different operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6165379","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive fuzzy gain scheduling for load frequency control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive fuzzy gain scheduling for load frequency control","sourcePdf":"00744505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033797S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"239","articleId":"744505","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":744507,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"744507","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":879},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744507","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Power system stability","Power system modeling","Power system transients","Torque","Power system dynamics","Power generation","Couplings","Application software","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","power system analysis computing","damping","load (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","damping representation","computer simulation","computer programs","software development","program application"]}],"abstract":"The paper includes a review and summary of the actual damping in electric power systems and the methods for modeling such damping in the various computer programs used to study power system stability.

The growth of this market will be even more significant for subquarter micron technologies-whose growth is driven by the multimedia industry. The customer base will extend beyond traditional fabless IC companies into vertically integrated IC manufacturers and system vendors. Given the rate of growth and the high technology profile of products, substantial investments in capital, technology, and skilled workforce have to be dedicated and managed effectively for ensuring a successful partnership.

Our analysis indicates that fabless-foundry contracts that are based on a fixed number of good dies, and better yield information are more profitable.","doi":"10.1109/66.744521","startPage":"44","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel4/66/16091/00744521.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.744521","endPage":"52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabless-foundry partnership: models and analysis of coordination issues","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Fabless-foundry partnership: models and analysis of coordination issues","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6186347","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabless-foundry partnership: models and analysis of coordination issues","sourcePdf":"00744521.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029446S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"15","articleId":"744521","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":744524,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This paper presents the use of a dynamic phasor model of the TCSC in studies of subsynchronous resonance (SSR). Their earlier dynamic phasor models of the TCSC are further simplified here, and tested at typical subsynchronous frequencies. The phasor model of the TCSC is directly compatible with the conventional models used for the other system components relevant to SSR. The proposed approach to SSR analysis is an attractive alternative to approaches based on sampled-data models, and to torque-per-unit-velocity methods. The dynamic phasor approach has been tested on the IEEE first benchmark SSR model, showing outstanding agreement with more computationally demanding alternative methods for eigenvalue analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thyristors","Power capacitors","Power system dynamics","Power system modeling","Resonance","Frequency","Flexible AC transmission systems","Time domain analysis","Damping","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","subsynchronous resonance","power capacitors","thyristor convertors","control system analysis","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","flexible AC transmission systems","power transmission control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thyristor-controlled series capacitor","SSR analysis","dynamic phasor model","power swing oscillations","control simulation","subsynchronous resonance","torque-per-unit-velocity methods","eigenvalue analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/59.744524","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/59/16090/00744524.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.744524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSR analysis with dynamic phasor model of thyristor-controlled series capacitor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SSR analysis with dynamic phasor model of thyristor-controlled series capacitor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744524/","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6165387","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSR analysis with dynamic phasor model of thyristor-controlled series capacitor","sourcePdf":"00744524.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03748S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"77","articleId":"744524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":744532,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The accuracy of the mode estimates is limited by the noise content always found in field measured signals. Current Prony analysis methods assume the system to be single output, and individual signals are analyzed independently often resulting in conflicting frequency and damping estimates (due to noise effects). This paper considers a simple extension to Prony analysis that allows multiple signals to be analyzed simultaneously resulting in one set of mode estimates. Examples are used to show that this extension improves the accuracy of modal estimates and simplifies the analysis steps. The first example uses a Monte Carlo type simulation model and the second analyzes field measured data from the western North American power system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Power measurement","Frequency estimation","Power system simulation","Power system modeling","Noise measurement","Damping","Monte Carlo methods","Analytical models","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oscillations","damping","Monte Carlo methods","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Prony analysis","multiple signals","power oscillations","measured ringdowns","noise content","field measured signals","damping","Monte Carlo type simulation model","western North American power system","field measured data analysis","power systems"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.744537","startPage":"226","endPage":"231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/59/16090/00744537.pdf","doi":"10.1109/59.744537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Making Prony analysis more accurate using multiple signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Making Prony analysis more accurate using multiple signals","accessionNumber":"6165390","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","volume":"14","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Making Prony analysis more accurate using multiple signals","sourcePdf":"00744537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043153S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"232","articleId":"744537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":744539,"authors":[{"name":"T.W.

Global image quantities usually describe images with fewer data. When computed at the point of sensing, global quantities result in a low-latency performance due to the reduced data transfer requirements between an image sensor and a processor. The global quantities also help global top-down adaptation: the quantities are continuously computed on-chip, and are readily available to sensing for adaptation. As an example, we have developed a sorting image computational sensor-a VLSI chip which senses an image and sorts all pixel by their intensities. The first sorting sensor prototype is a 21/spl times/26 array of cells. It receives an image optically, senses it, and computes the image's cumulative histogram-a global quantity which can be quickly routed off chip via one pin. In addition, the global cumulative histogram is used internally on-chip in a top-down fashion to adapt the values in individual pixel so as to reflect the index of the incoming light, thus computing an \"image of indices\". The image of indices never saturates and has a uniform histogram.","doi":"10.1109/70.744603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/16069/00744603.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.744603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI sorting image sensor: global massively parallel intensity-to-time processing for low-latency adaptive vision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI sorting image sensor: global massively parallel intensity-to-time processing for low-latency adaptive vision","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6172847","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI sorting image sensor: global massively parallel intensity-to-time processing for low-latency adaptive vision","sourcePdf":"00744603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031357S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"24","articleId":"744603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":744610,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We have proposed a micro-hand having two fingers, a prototype of which has been designed and built using parallel mechanisms. We discuss the structure of our micro-hand and its operation system. The structure of the two-fingered micro-hand is strongly related to its effective workspace. The design of the micro-hand has been influenced by consideration of the usage of chopsticks. A calibration method based on least-square error is proposed for three degrees of freedom (DOF) translational motion in task coordinates fixed under a microscope. Development of a useful operational device to control the micro-hand is important for achieving dexterous micro-manipulation. A force feedback system would be ideal for such manipulation. In the case of micro-manipulation, though, a sensor with high resolution and multiple sensing axes is needed. There is no sensor meeting this demand currently. In order to achieve micro-manipulation without the force feedback system, an operational system which can be controlled with natural operational feeling like manipulation of actual human hand, is important. We have developed an operational device which is controlled by one hand. The forefinger and thumb are used to manipulate microscopic objects in tele-operation. However, due to kinematic dissimilarity between the master and the micro-hand, the motion of the fingers cannot be directly used as operational signals to move the micro-hand. We have therefore developed an operational strategy which compensates for this dissimilarity, thus providing for easy manipulation.","doi":"10.1109/70.744610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/16069/00744610.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.744610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a micro-manipulation system having a two-fingered micro-hand","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744610/","displayDocTitle":"Development of a micro-manipulation system having a two-fingered micro-hand","volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6172854","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a micro-manipulation system having a two-fingered micro-hand","sourcePdf":"00744610.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033199S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"194","articleId":"744610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":744611,"authors":[{"name":"Yun-Hui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yun-Hui Liu","id":"37279412600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1042-296X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-958X"}],"articleNumber":"744611","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":165,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":833},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"abstract":"This paper formalizes qualitative test of 3D frictional form-closure grasps of n robotic fingers as a problem of linear programming (LP).

We demonstrate that the problem of querying whether the origin lies inside the convex hull is equivalent to a ray-shooting problem, which is dual to a LP problem based on the duality between convex hulls and convex polytopes. Furthermore, this paper addresses a problem of minimizing the L/sub 1/ norm of the grasp forces balancing an external wrench, which can be also transformed to a ray-shooting problem.

The system was developed to enable calibration of UHF couplers that are used to detect insulation defects in gas insulated substations. The frequency response of a sensor is determined using fast Fourier transform (FFT) processing of its output voltage when it is subjected to a step electric field with a rise time of less than 300 ps. Provided the step response of the sensor is relatively short, the absorbing termination of the GTEM cell can be dispensed with, simplifying its construction. The need for impedance matching at the cell input can be eliminated by using a signal source that absorbs the reflected energy. In addition, the use of a wire septum offers the potential for improving field uniformity. A description of the measurement system is given, and some typical results are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel4/19/16096/00744636.pdf","startPage":"875","endPage":"880","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/19.744636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.744636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16096","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pulsed GTEM system for UHF sensor calibration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor systems","Calibration","Gas insulation","Electric variables measurement","UHF measurements","Electromagnetic measurements","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Electromagnetic fields","Couplers","Substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric field measurement","electric sensing devices","UHF measurement","calibration","gas insulated substations","insulation testing","frequency response","fast Fourier transforms","impedance matching","antenna testing","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulsed GTEM system","UHF sensor","electric field sensors","gigahertz transverse electromagnetic cell","calibration","insulation defects","gas insulated substations","frequency response","fast Fourier transform","output voltage","step electric field","rise time","absorbing termination","impedance matching","signal source","wire septum","field uniformity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","displayDocTitle":"A pulsed GTEM system for UHF sensor calibration","volume":"47","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6178332","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pulsed GTEM system for UHF sensor calibration","sourcePdf":"00744636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028159S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"16096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"98","articleId":"744636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":744659,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The particular application poses many design challenges for the beamformer, namely broad bandwidth, wide dynamic range, high weight accuracy and resolution, and rapid weight settling time. In addition to these requirements, the beamformer needs to be of low cost with the intention of reuse in a commercial application. The beamformer has been simulated, built and has undergone extensive testing. The results obtained from the beamformer in 'stand-alone' mode and within an adaptive loop, show the design challenges were all successfully met using a PIN diode based analogue beamformer design. The exceptional weight accuracy was achieved by a combination of a novel analogue linearising circuit and a digital look-up table. The dearest testament to the successful design of the beamformer is its performance within the adaptive loop, where the speed and accuracy of the beamformer achieved rapid and stable adaptation against interference.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744664/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6169016","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"28-28 Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The design of an analogue beamformer for adaptive antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design of an analogue beamformer for adaptive antennas","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00744664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049924S","chronDate":"28 Oct 1998","isNumber":"16093","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6027","citationCount":"1","articleId":"744664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":744667,"authors":[{"name":"E.

ABF provides an electronic counter-counter measure (ECCM) capability. It uses the degrees of freedom (DOF) available with a spatial multichannel system to suppress jamming sources. STAP enhances the detection in the presence of clutter. It generalises ABF in that it also uses temporal DOFs. The radiating elements of an AESA radar are distributed on a planar surface such that the spatial sampling condition is obeyed. The latter implies that the distance between adjacent radiating elements has to be in the vicinity of half the RF wavelength. The paper presents an outline of the relevant system level issues specific to the development of ABF AESA based airborne applications and approaches to solutions. Also selected results of performance assessments are discussed along with some open questions.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19980871","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium On Electronic Beam Steering","pdfPath":"/iel4/6027/16093/00744667.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19980871","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium On Electronic Beam Steering","startPage":"4/1","endPage":"4/9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aspects of adaptive beamforming with an AESA radar with subarray architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Aspects of adaptive beamforming with an AESA radar with subarray architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744667/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6169019","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28-28 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aspects of adaptive beamforming with an AESA radar with subarray architecture","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00744667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027778S","chronDate":"28 Oct 1998","isNumber":"16093","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6027","citationCount":"3","articleId":"744667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":744744,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The novelty of our approach lies in each data item carrying a control tag to specify how it is to be operated upon by a receiving cell and in performing two parallel comparisons within each cell. To assure first-in/first-out handling of equal key values, some data items must be marked to reflect their past histories. Such marking is conveniently carried out by modifying the data item's control tag. It is the combination of the above features that allows us to derive the first single-cycle priority queue that operates in fully pipelined mode, with no broadcasting of data values or control signals. By performing more than two parallel comparisons in each cell, the VLSI implementation cost of our stable sorter can be reduced. We show that highly cost-effective designs can be obtained by selecting an optimal cell size in terms of the number of comparators it contains.","doi":"10.1109/71.744832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/16098/00744832.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.744832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16098","startPage":"23","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven control scheme for linear arrays: application to a stable insertion sorter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven control scheme for linear arrays: application to a stable insertion sorter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6166319","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven control scheme for linear arrays: application to a stable insertion sorter","sourcePdf":"00744832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043335S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"19","articleId":"744832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":744842,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The Hopfield neural network is commonly referred to in finding an optimal solution and a fast convergence to the result, however, it often traps to a local minimum. Stochastic simulated annealing has an advantage in finding the optimal solution; it provides a chance to escape from the local minimum. Both significant characteristics of the Hopfield neural network structure and stochastic simulated annealing algorithm are combined together to yield a so called mean field annealing technique. A complicated job scheduling problem of a multiprocessor with multiprocess instance under execution time limitation process migration inhibited and bounded available resource constraints is presented. An energy based equation is developed first whose structure depends on precise constraints and acceptable solutions using an extended 3D Hopfield neural network (HNN) and the normalized mean field annealing (MFA) technique; a variant of mean field annealing was conducted as well. A modified cooling procedure to accelerate a reaching equilibrium for normalized mean field annealing was applied to the study. The simulation results show that the derived energy function worked effectively, and good and valid solutions for sophisticated scheduling instance can be obtained using both schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TAI.1998.744856","startPage":"288","endPage":"294","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Tenth IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (Cat.

Recorded images and sounds co-exist with their computer-generated counterparts, a new language for sound promises compact-disk quality at extremely low data rates; and the multimedia content could even adjust itself to suit the transmission rate and quality. Possibly the greatest of the advances made by MPEG-4 is that viewers and listeners need no longer be passive. The height of \"interactivity\" in audiovisual systems today is the users ability merely to stop or start a video in progress. MPEG-4 is completely different: it allows the user to interact with objects within the scene, whether they derive from so-called real sources, such as moving video, or from synthetic sources, such as computer-aided design output or computer-generated cartoons. Authors of content can give users the power to modify scenes by deleting, adding, or repositioning objects, or to alter the behavior of the objects. Perhaps the most immediate need for MPEG-4 is defensive. It supplies tools with which to create uniform (and top-quality) audio and video encoders and decoders on the Internet, preempting what may become an unmanageable tangle of proprietary formats. In addition to the Internet, the standard is also designed for low bit-rate communications devices, which are usually wireless.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPEG-4 multimedia for our time","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","doi":"10.1109/6.744873","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel4/6/16099/00744873.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6.744873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=744873","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/744873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"MPEG-4 multimedia for our time","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6171724","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPEG-4 multimedia for our time","sourcePdf":"0299-026MPEG.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028253S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"68","articleId":"744873","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":744977,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This paper proposes to use a particular neural network structure and to perform only an off-line identification, allowing a linear adaptive controller to cope with the time-variances. This goal is reached by taking a Hammerstein model and extending it to allow an input hysteresis. The whole time-variance is lumped in the linear part of the model. A neural network with the corresponding structure can then be trained off-line to produce the inverse of the nonlinear part, while a standard adaptive self-tuning controller can cope with the time-variance. Simulation results on actual measurements are shown to prove both the suitability of the approach as well as the need of an adaptive linear model.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.744977","startPage":"2566","endPage":"2569 vol.5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Neural networks with a three-layer structure can be used to generate control replacing the manual control to deliver the stimulation during walking. Sensors which have been used to provide information for the controller range in complexity from simple heel or hand switches to accelerometers. There are three basic problems connected with the selection of sensors: sensor types, number of sensors and the optimum location on the limb. Kinematic signals can be simulated from 3D data collected from a motion analysis system. These 'virtual' sensors (goniometers, gyroscopes, inclinometers and accelerometers) showed a good correlation with their physical counterparts. The aim of this study was to use neural network to generate optimum FES controllers. 32 sensors ('virtual' kinematic sensors and physical sensors recording crutch forces and foot floor contacts) were used to find an optimum sensor set. The results have shown that neural networks with a small optimum sensor set could produce a robust controller with a higher degree of accuracy than a traditional heel switch controller. After few months, the controller still maintained a high accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.744984","startPage":"2582","endPage":"2585 vol.5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

MPI-LITE, a portable library that supports multithreaded MPI, is also described. MPI-SIM, built on top of MPI-LITE, can be used to predict the performance of existing MPI programs as a function of architectural characteristics, including number of processors and message communication latencies. The simulation models can be executed sequentially or in parallel. Parallel executions of MPI-SIM models are synchronized using a set of asynchronous conservative protocols. MPI-SIM reduces synchronization overheads by exploiting the communication characteristics of the program it simulates. This paper presents validation and performance results from the use of MPI-SIM to simulate applications from the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite. Using the techniques described here, we are able to reduce the number of synchronizations in the parallel simulation as compared with the synchronous quantum protocol and are able to achieve speedups ranging from 3.2-11.9 in going from sequential to parallel simulation using 16 processors on the IBM SP2.","doi":"10.1109/WSC.1998.745023","publicationTitle":"1998 Winter Simulation Conference.

The authors have experimented with OTA-C filters for frequency shaping purposes in micropower all-CMOS hearing aids as against conventionally used switched capacitor filters, as switched capacitor filters present problem due to switching noise and require a double polysilicon technology in a low voltage process. The power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of such filters becomes important in hearing aids, as the negative supply voltage for the OTA is derived from the low voltage battery by the use of a dc to dc converter through capacitor switching where a ripple voltage on supply rail is inherent due to charging and discharging mechanism in the converter circuit. A regulated cascode (RGC) differential stage is used for OTA to increase the linearity of the differential input stage and ensure an acceptable level of CMRR. An important finding that has emerged in the present investigation from the viewpoint of application of OTA-C filters in hearing aids is that PSRR of high pass filter is much higher compared to that in low pass configuration. The results have been validated both by SPICE simulation and measurement of OTA-C filter chips fabricated for hearing aid application.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power supplies","Filters","Hearing aids","Capacitors","Low voltage","Transconductance","Operational amplifiers","Frequency","Noise shaping","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifiers","active filters","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","hearing aids","low-power electronics","high-pass filters","low-pass filters","SPICE","circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sub-circuit analysis","power supply rejection ratio","regulated cascode operational transconductance amplifiers","operational transconductance amplifier filters","frequency shaping purposes","micropower all-CMOS hearing aids","double polysilicon technology","low voltage process","ripple voltage","charging mechanism","discharging mechanism","differential input stage","high pass filter","low pass configuration","SPICE simulation","dc to dc converter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1999.745143","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Twelfth International Conference on VLSI Design.

The test procedure is rapid enough to be performed on the fly whenever the system is reconfigured.

The transient energy is minimized when every gate has no more than one output transition per clock cycle. This condition is achieved for a gate when the gate delay equals or exceeds the maximum difference between path delays at gate inputs. In practice, path delays are adjusted either by increasing gate delays or by inserting delay buffers. The minimum transient energy design is obtained when no delay buffer is added. This design requires possible increases in gate delays to meet the minimum energy condition at all gates. However, the delay of the critical path may be increased. In an alternative design, where the critical path delay is not allowed to increase, delay buffers may have to be added. The theory in this paper allows trade-offs between minimum transient energy and critical path delay. We formulate the problem as a linear program to obtain the minimum transient energy design with the smallest number of delay buffers for a given overall delay of the circuit. An optimized four-bit ALU circuit is found to consume 53% peak and 73% average power compared to the original circuit.","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1999.745194","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Twelfth International Conference on VLSI Design.

Repeater insertion in interconnects is an increasingly important element in the physical design of high-performance VLSI systems. By interconnect tuning, we refer to the selection of line thicknesses, widths and spacings in multi-layer interconnect to simultaneously optimize signal distribution, signal performance, signal integrity, and interconnect manufacturability and reliability. This is a key activity in most leading-edge design projects, but has received little attention in the literature. Our work provides the first technology-specific studies of interconnect tuning in the literature. We center on global wiring layers and interconnect tuning issues related to bus routing, repeater insertion, and choice of shielding/spacing rules for signal integrity and performance. We address four basic questions. (1) How should width and spacing be allocated to maximize performance for a given line pitch? (2) For a given line pitch, what criteria affect the optimal interval at which repeaters should be inserted into global interconnects? (3) Under what circumstances are shield wires the optimum technique for improving interconnect performance? (4) In global interconnect with repeaters, what other interconnect tuning is possible? Our study of question (4) demonstrates a new approach of offsetting repeater placements that can reduce worst-case cross-chip delays by over 30% in current technologies.","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1999.745199","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Twelfth International Conference on VLSI Design.

However, the operation of these wheelchairs can still be a difficult and stressful task. Head movement is a natural form of pointing and can be used to directly replace the joystick whilst still allowing for similar control. Through the use of artificial intelligence, a trainable wheelchair controller can be designed which provides an alternative control method with improved posture, ease of use and attractiveness. A computer simulation of this head controlled wheelchair has been successfully designed and tested. It consists of a motion detector for head motion measurement, a telemetry system for the elimination of wiring, and neural networks to provide the system with the ability to be trained for each individual operator irrespective of their disability.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.745241","pdfPath":"/iel4/6018/16089/00745241.pdf","startPage":"2731","endPage":"2733 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

To learn about the changes appearing in the geometry of stump, muscles and bone after above-knee (AK) amputation and their changes during stump actions, transverse magnetic resonance images (MRI) have been obtained for both amputated and contralateral legs of three AK unilateral amputees. The 2D images showed that the shape of the limb changed and the muscles atrophied after amputation. During stump actions, the positions and geometry of the stump, bone and muscles also changed.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Our algorithm minimizes the main memory and disk space requirements on the visualization workstation, while speeding up isosurface extraction queries. Our overall approach is a two-level indexing scheme. First, by our meta-cell technique, we partition the original dataset into clusters of cells, called meta-cells. Secondly, we produce meta-intervals associated with the meta-cells, and build an indexing data structure on the meta-intervals. We separate the cell information, kept only in meta-cells on disk, from the indexing structure, which is also on disk and only contains pointers to meta-cells. Our meta-cell technique is an I/O-efficient approach for computing a k-d-tree-like partition of the dataset. Our indexing data structure, the binary blocked I/O interval tree, is a new I/O-optimal data structure to perform stabbing queries that report from a set of meta-intervals (or intervals) those containing a query value q. Our tree is simpler to implement, and is also more space-efficient in practice than existing structures. To perform an isosurface query, we first query the indexing structure, and then use the reported meta-cell pointers to read from disk the active meta-cells intersected by the isosurface. The isosurface itself can then be generated from active meta-cells. Rather than being a single cost indexing approach, our technique exhibits a smooth trade-off between query time and disk space.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16079","startPage":"167","endPage":"174","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

The visibility tests are done in two phases. First, coarse visibility tests are performed in software to determine the visible cells. These tests are based on hierarchical tiles and shear-warp factorization. The second phase resolves the visible portions of the extracted triangles and is accomplished by the graphics hardware. While the latest isosurface extraction methods have effectively eliminated the search phase bottleneck, the cost of constructing and rendering the isosurface remains high. Many of today's large datasets contain very large and complex isosurfaces that can easily overwhelm even state-of-the-art graphics hardware. The proposed approach is output sensitive and is thus well suited for remote visualization applications where the extraction and rendering phases are done on a separate machines.","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745300","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

We describe a new method that determines the membership of a given sample point to an object by reclassifying the sample point using interpolation of the original intensity values and searching for the best fitting object in the neighbourhood. Using a ray-casting approach we then compute the surface location between successive sample points along the viewing-ray by interpolation or bisection. The accurate calculation of the object boundary enables a much more precise computation of the gray-level-gradient yielding the surface normal. Our new approach significantly improves the quality of reconstructed and shaded surfaces and reduces aliasing artifacts for animations and magnified views. We illustrate the results on different cases including the Visible-Human-Data, where we achieve nearly photo-realistic images.","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1998.745311","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

This design technique enables cost-effective electrification to be implemented but the fault-tolerance of the resultant system is limited. The use of monitoring systems to monitor the condition of the OHLE and pantograph enables the detection of faults before catastrophic failures occur, thus preventing expensive and inconvenient delays to rail-borne traffic. Installation and correct use of such systems should enable high-speed electrified railways to operate reliably. The author briefly describes three monitoring systems. The first is the Brecknell Willis and Co. Pantograph Force Measuring Device (PFMD). This precision instrument is used by a fitter in a depot to determine whether he has completed pantograph maintenance work satisfactorily. The second is the AEA Technology Rail Panchex/sup (R)/ system, which measures the dynamic performance of a pantograph automatically, as a train passes through a suitably equipped trackside monitoring site. The third is the AEA Technology Rail OLIVE/sup (R)/ system which is capable of detecting overhead line imperfections automatically.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19981002","publicationTitle":"IEE Current Collections for High Speed Trains Seminar (Ref.

For the PN considerations, VUG is limited by the inherent problems of the nonlinear process. The PN can be canceled with the drawback of higher spectral occupation. SNR performances are in the same range for the three sources and better than 35 dB. Power stability could be improved, but are less than /spl plusmn/1.5 dB and are fulfilling FRANS specifications. The detected RF power is better for SH and SSB, but loss conversions in the harmonics process are lowering power at 29.88 GHz. In terms of complexity, VUG and SSB are equivalent techniques (monolithic semiconductor devices). The SH source has, at the moment a higher complexity, however its integration is planned and should also provide a compact and potentially low cost mm wave source.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid fiber-radio systems in the mm wave range: a comparison between available optical sources","publicationTitle":"International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics.

In particular, the model is used to describe deviation of the speckle component from the Rayleigh to Weibull or other pdfs with longer tails. The GC-pdf is formed using the generalized gamma (G/spl Gamma/) pdf to describe both the speckle and the modulation component of the radar clutter.

The basic idea for this estimator is to incorporate the dynamic matrix and the forgetting factor into the least squares (LS) method to remedy the lack of knowledge of noises. We call it the extended forgetting factor recursive least squares (EFRLS) estimator. This estimator is shown to have similar asymptotic properties to a completely specified Kalman filter state estimator. More importantly, the performance of EFRLS greatly exceeds that of existing filtering techniques when the noise variance is misspecified. In addition, EFRLS also performs well when there is cross-correlation between the process and measurement noise streams or temporal dependencies within those streams. Some discussions and a number of simulations are made to provide practical guidance on the choice of an optimal forgetting factor and evaluate the performance of the EFRLS algorithms, which strongly dominates that of the standard forgetting factor recursive least squares (FRLS) and some misspecified Kalman filtering.","doi":"10.1109/7.745684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16108","startPage":"102","endPage":"114","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/16108/00745684.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.745684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient recursive state estimator for dynamic systems without knowledge of noise covariances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recursive estimation","State estimation","Least squares approximation","Kalman filters","Time varying systems","Aerodynamics","Noise measurement","Filtering algorithms","Covariance matrix","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive estimation","least squares approximations","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient recursive state estimator","dynamic systems","noise covariances","dynamic matrix","least squares method","extended forgetting factor recursive least squares estimator","asymptotic properties","Kalman filter state estimator","cross-correlation","measurement noise streams","temporal dependencies","standard forgetting factor recursive least squares"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Efficient recursive state estimator for dynamic systems without knowledge of noise covariances","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/745684/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"35","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6171696","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient recursive state estimator for dynamic systems without knowledge of noise covariances","sourcePdf":"00745684.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028398S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"48","articleId":"745684","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":745686,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The algorithm can be used to track a large number of targets from measurements obtained with a large number of radars. The use of the algorithm is illustrated on measurements obtained from 5 FAA radars, which are asynchronous, heterogeneous, and geographically distributed over a large area. Both secondary radar data (beacon returns from cooperative targets) as well as primary radar data (skin returns from noncooperative targets) are used. The target IDs from the beacon returns are not used in the data association. The surveillance region includes about 800 targets that exhibit different types of motion. The performance of an IMM estimator with linear motion models is compared with that of the Kalman filter (KF). A number of performance measures that can be used on real data without knowledge of the ground truth are presented for this purpose. It is shown that the IMM estimator performs better than the KF. The advantage of fusing multisensor data is quantified. It is also shown that the computational requirements in the multisensor case are lower than in single sensor case, Finally, an IMM estimator with a nonlinear motion model (coordinated turn) is shown to further improve the performance during the maneuvering periods over the IMM with linear models.","doi":"10.1109/7.745696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/16108/00745696.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.745696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precision large scale air traffic surveillance using IMM/assignment estimators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/745696/","displayDocTitle":"Precision large scale air traffic surveillance using IMM/assignment estimators","volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6171708","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precision large scale air traffic surveillance using IMM/assignment estimators","sourcePdf":"00745696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048855S","chronDate":"Jan.  1999","isNumber":"16108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"103","articleId":"745696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":745697,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoqiang Bi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Zhaoqiang Bi","id":"37087436075"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jian Li","id":"37087145894"},{"name":"Zheng-She Liu","affiliation":["OEM Research and Development, 3COM Corporation, Skokie, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Zheng-She Liu","id":"37087354754"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"745697","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":793},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Radar polarimetry","Feature extraction","Data models","Robustness","Synthetic aperture radar","History","Parameter estimation","Data mining","Bismuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar","data models","radar resolution","image resolution","adaptive estimation","parameter estimation","fast Fourier transforms","feature extraction","radar computing","adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superresolution SAR imaging","parametric spectral estimation methods","parametric data models","data matrices","large dimensions","fast Fourier transform","robust spectral estimation algorithms","feature extraction","relaxation-based algorithms","RELAX algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Super resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image formation via sophisticated parametric spectral estimation algorithms is considered.

An approach, called linear unmixing Kalman filtering (LUKF), is presented, which incorporates the concept of linear unmixing into Kalman filtering so as to achieve signature abundance estimation, subpixel detection and classification for remotely sensed images. In this case, the linear mixture model used in linear unmixing is implemented as the measurement equation in Kalman filtering. The state equation which is required for Kalman filtering but absent in linear unmixing is then used to model the signature abundance. By utilizing these two equations the proposed LUKF not only can detect abrupt changes in various signature abundances within pixels, but also can detect and classify desired target signatures. The performance of effectiveness and robustness of the LUKF is demonstrated through simulated data and real scene images, Satellite Pour I'Observation de la Terra (SPOT) and Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection (HYDICE) data.","doi":"10.1109/7.745701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/16108/00745701.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.745701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16108","startPage":"319","endPage":"330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kalman filtering approach to multispectral/hyperspectral image classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Kalman filtering approach to multispectral/hyperspectral image classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/745701/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6171713","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman filtering approach to multispectral/hyperspectral image classification","sourcePdf":"00745701.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036094S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"12","articleId":"745701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":745707,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

However, as the complexity of their offerings increases, software tools more sophisticated than existing Web facilities are needed. Distributed object technology may be the answer. The availability of high-volume, increasingly sophisticated information is making the need for metadata facilities more urgent. Traditional, library-based approaches break down when used in an advanced digital library. More modular mechanisms are needed, and the CORBA system is one approach. Digital libraries are affected at a deep technical level by the widely differing user traditions of Web users and library patrons. The challenge and opportunity of digital libraries will be the synthesis of these traditions.

In their view, a digital library comprises widely distributed resources that can be maintained autonomously by different organizations and will not require adherence to uniform interfaces.","doi":"10.1109/2.745724","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","startPage":"80","endPage":"87","publicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel4/2/16115/00745724.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.745724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using distributed objects to build the Stanford digital library Infobus","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software libraries","User interfaces","Java","Testing","Resource management","Computer languages","Information analysis","Animation","Hardware","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed object management","Internet","information resources","digital libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed objects","Stanford digital library","Infobus","information processing services","software tools","World Wide Web","metadata","CORBA","user traditions","library patrons","technical infrastructure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Using distributed objects to build the Stanford digital library Infobus","volume":"32","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6163112","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/745724/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using distributed objects to build the Stanford digital library Infobus","sourcePdf":"00745724.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029095S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"22","articleId":"745724","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":745735,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It compares five algorithms, including the linear design, with respect to their ease of design and their closed-loop performance. For all these algorithms local asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium is ensured. The motivation of the present study is not to illustrate the validity of these theoretical results, but to test their performance when confronted with a real physical application where situations not predicted by the theory will arise. The behavior of the schemes is compared with the following basic criteria: transient and steady state response to steps and sinusoidal references, attenuation of disturbances in the power supply, and sensitivity to unknown loads. Particular emphasis is placed throughout on the flexibility provided by the tuning parameters to shape the responses. Even though this issue is not always appreciated in theoretical studies, we have found it of prime importance in experimentation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Switches","Inductors","Capacitors","Voltage control","Switching circuits","Control design","Uncertainty","Pulse generation","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","nonlinear control systems","control system synthesis","closed loop systems","asymptotic stability","controllers","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear controllers","DC-DC power converter","boost converter","design ease","closed-loop performance","local asymptotic stability","equilibrium","transient response","steady state response","steps","sinusoidal references","disturbance attenuation","power supply","unknown load sensitivity"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.745771","startPage":"66","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/5488303/16117/00745771.pdf","doi":"10.1109/37.745771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental comparison of several nonlinear controllers for power converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"An experimental comparison of several nonlinear controllers for power converters","accessionNumber":"6176740","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","volume":"19","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/745771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental comparison of several nonlinear controllers for power converters","sourcePdf":"00745771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038575S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"142","articleId":"745771","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":745773,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

A fast and reliable QRS detection algorithm based on a one-pole filter has been developed. Automatic ECG classification using hidden Markov models (HMMs) is investigated. Models representing various types of beat are trained using the American Heart Association (AHA) ventricular arrhythmia ECG data. The types of beat being selected in the study are: normal (N), premature ventricular contraction (V), and fusion of ventricular and normal beats (F). Artificial ECG generated from the model shows that each model truly characterizes that particular type of beat. In the testing phase, ECG signals are classified using the trained models.

Three algorithms for eliminating maternal ECG are compared. Two adaptive filtering techniques, LMS (least mean square) and RLS (recursive least squares), are compared to a new algorithm that uses the blind source separation (BSS) theorem to separate the FECG from signals that are recorded with a lot of MECG interference. Simulation studies were first performed. Two independent ECG signals (sources) were simulated; one was considered as the MECG while the other was the FECG. By mixing the two sources with various channels, the algorithms were checked and compared. The algorithms were tested on real data as well as that taken from DAISY (the DAtabase for the Identification of SYstems). Conclusions concerning the mixing system were drawn both from the real data and from the simulation experiments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1998.745866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16075","startPage":"174","endPage":"177 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

We produce the estimates from the CDMA System Static Simulator by preprocessing the simulator inputs and post-processing its outputs. The estimates are of capacities of multicarrier systems using simple carrier assignment disciplines, and of wideband CDMA systems.

Two main groups of algorithms are employed for this task, i.e., scanning and tracking. According to the known blood vessel feature, a second-order derivative Gaussian matched filter is designed and used to locate the center point and width of a vessel in its cross sectional profile. Together with this the extended Kalman filter is employed for the optimal linear estimation of the next possible location of blood vessel segment by appropriate formulation of its pattern changing process and observation model. To check the bifurcation in the vessel network, a simple branching detection strategy is implemented during tracking. The proposed algorithms all work well in the whole tracking process and can detect more complete vessel network in the ocular fundus photographs.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.746160","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

A separate neural structure was designed for use with selected additional post-operative parameters. Output variables for both systems were recurrence at 12, 18 and 24 months. Prediction specificities, using pre-operative data alone, were 60%, 62% and 60%, respectively. Inclusion of post-operative parameters improved the specificity to 72.7% at 12 months, 66% at 18 months and 62.2% at 24 months, while the sensitivity of prediction at 18 months reached 90% and at two years 93%. There was a strong correlation between the predictive value of pre- and post-operative findings in individual patients at each time period (correlation coefficient=0.6333, p<0.0001; 0.4873, p=0.0083; 0.266, p=0.0025). This study demonstrates that artificial neural networks are able to reliably predict, even with limited clinical pre-operative information, patients who are destined to fail when treated by surgery alone. This approach may have a role in assisting clinicians to achieve more appropriate selection of patients for surgery and neo-adjuvant therapy.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.746214","startPage":"3335","endPage":"3338 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Two different methods are used to take into account the inequality constraints in the computation of the stationary value of the action integral: the Valentine variables method and the penalty functions method. The equations of motion resulting from the application of the Valentine variables method, which introduces the concept of \"nonsmooth\" impacts, constitute the exact model of the constrained mechanical system; such a model is suitable to be employed when the impacting parts of the actual mechanical system are very stiff. The equations of motion resulting from the application of the penalty functions method, which introduces the concept of \"smooth impacts,\" constitute an approximate model of the constrained mechanical system; such a model is suitable to be employed when the impacting parts of the actual mechanical system show some flexibility. Various feedback control laws from the natural outputs and from their time derivatives are studied with reference to both models of impact; the closed-loop systems resulting from the application of the same control law to both models show pretty much the same global asymptotic stability properties.

In this paper, this assumption is removed by using an initial state learning scheme together with the traditional D-type ILC updating law. Both linear and nonlinear time-varying uncertain systems are investigated. Uniform bounds for the final tracking errors are obtained and these bounds are only dependent on the system uncertainties and disturbances, yet independent of the initial errors.

Performances of the proposed self-tuning FLCs are compared with those of their corresponding conventional FLCs in terms of several performance measures such as peak overshoot, settling time, rise time, integral absolute error and integral-of-time-multiplied absolute error, in addition to the responses due to step set-point change and load disturbance and, in each case, the proposed scheme shows a remarkably improved performance over its conventional counterpart.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6188191","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A robust self-tuning scheme for PI- and PD-type fuzzy controllers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust self-tuning scheme for PI- and PD-type fuzzy controllers","sourcePdf":"00746295.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038106S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"376","articleId":"746295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":746300,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In the paper, two new methods for stable adaptive fuzzy control are presented. The first method is an extension of an existing concept: it is shown that a major drawback of that concept, the necessity for new adaptation at every change of the reference signal, can be avoided by a simple modification. The main focus of the paper is on the presentation of a second method, which extends the applicability of stable adaptive fuzzy control to a broader class of nonlinear plants; this is achieved by an improved controller structure adopted from the neural network domain. Performance and limitations of the proposed methods, as well as some practical design aspects, are discussed and illustrated with simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6188193","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An improved stable adaptive fuzzy control method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved stable adaptive fuzzy control method","sourcePdf":"00746301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039196S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"161","articleId":"746301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":746302,"authors":[{"name":"Tai-Kyung Kim","affiliation":["CAE, Semiconductor R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tai-Kyung Kim","id":"37336844300"},{"name":"Do-Hyung Kim","affiliation":["TD, Semiconductor R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Do-Hyung Kim","id":"37291951500"},{"name":"Jae-Kwan Park","affiliation":["TD, TD Semiconductor R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Kwan Park","id":"38546638200"},{"name":"Tai-Su Park","affiliation":["PD, Semiconductor R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tai-Su Park","id":"37280399900"},{"name":"Young-Kwan Park","affiliation":["CAE, Semiconductor R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Kwan Park","id":"37367829300"},{"name":"Hoong-Joo Lee","affiliation":["TD, Semiconductor R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hoong-Joo Lee","id":"38182610500"},{"name":"Kang-Yoon Lee","affiliation":["CAE, Semiconductor R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kang-Yoon Lee","id":"37337431000"},{"name":"Jeong-Taek Kong","affiliation":["CAE, Semiconductor R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jeong-Taek Kong","id":"37277188600"},{"name":"Jong-Woo Park","affiliation":["TD, Semiconductor R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Woo Park","id":"37281004200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4774-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"746302","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":229},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=746302","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermomechanical processes","Thermal stresses","Random access memory","Leakage current","Fabrication","Annealing","History","Thermal degradation","Capacitive sensors","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal stresses","isolation technology","DRAM chips","annealing","finite element analysis","integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cumulative thermo-mechanical stress","shallow trench isolation process","DRAM","defect formation","ABAQUS","cumulative shear stress","thermal annealing process","defect-free process condition","1 Gbit"]}],"abstract":"The defects induced by the thermo-mechanical stress in the device fabrication process are correlated with device characteristics of 1 Gb DRAM.

The prespecified trajectory is composed of several nonisoclinal segments in the phase plane and is regarded as the piecewise sliding surface. First, let the uncertain system be approximated by a linguistic fuzzy rule base, then two fuzzy logic controllers are designed to achieve the hitting motion and preserve the system's state traveling on the prespecified trajectory. The main advantage of this control design is that the trial and error of the conventional fuzzy control design disappears. A practical example is given to illustrate the applicability of the algorithm.","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/16123/00746308.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"62","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.746308","doi":"10.1109/91.746308","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=746308","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Trajectory","Sliding mode control","Fuzzy logic","Control systems","Nonlinear control systems","Nonlinear systems","Uncertain systems","Fuzzy systems","Motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","tracking","fuzzy systems","control system synthesis","uncertain systems","nonlinear control systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control design","trajectory tracking","uncertain nonlinear systems","sliding-mode control","nonisoclinal segments","phase plane","piecewise sliding surface","linguistic fuzzy rule base","hitting motion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746308/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy control design for the trajectory tracking on uncertain nonlinear systems","accessionNumber":"6188195","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy control design for the trajectory tracking on uncertain nonlinear systems","sourcePdf":"00746308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046529S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"74","articleId":"746308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":746309,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

The critical defect density necessary for destructive breakdown has also been measured in this thickness range. These quantities are used to predict time to breakdown for ultra thin oxides at low voltages. The properties of the breakdown distribution, which becomes broader as the oxide thickness is reduced, are used to provide reliability projections for the total gate area on a chip. It is predicted that oxide reliability may limit oxide scaling to about 2.6 nm (CV extrapolated thickness) or 2.2 nm (QM thickness) for a 1 V supply voltage at room temperature and that the current SIA roadmap will be unattainable for reliability reasons by sometime early next century.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1998.

In this approach, we generalized the fuzzy integral as an excellent component for decision analysis. The generalization involves replacing the max (or min) operator in information aggregation with a fuzzy integral-based neuron, resulting in increased flexibility. The characteristics of the Choquet fuzzy integral are studied and a network-based decision-analysis framework is proposed. The trainable hierarchical network can be implemented utilizing the fuzzy integral-based neurons and connectives. The training algorithms are derived and several examples given to illustrate the behaviors of the networks. Also, we present a decision making experiment using the proposed network to learn appropriate functional relationships in the defective numeric fields detection domain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746311/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6188196","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Choquet fuzzy integral-based hierarchical networks for decision analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Choquet fuzzy integral-based hierarchical networks for decision analysis","sourcePdf":"00746311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032182S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"79","articleId":"746311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":746313,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Among the various layouts of 6T-SRAM cells, this layout provides minimum cell size and the smallest bit line capacitance with word transistor width over 0.75 /spl mu/m for the ultra high speed operation. It is also demonstrated quantitatively that the optimized SRAM cell layout for high speed use is different from that for low power use. The cell layout proposed also provides the excellent scalability beyond 0.18 /spl mu/m generation due to its highly simplified pattern design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746322/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6176415","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1998","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel 6T-SRAM cell technology designed with rectangular patterns scalable beyond 0.18 /spl mu/m generation and desirable for ultra high speed operation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel 6T-SRAM cell technology designed with rectangular patterns scalable beyond 0.18 /spl mu/m generation and desirable for ultra high speed operation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00746322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03765S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 1998","isNumber":"16109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036","citationCount":"15","articleId":"746322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":746324,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Design groups comprised of students from several different areas of specialization (e.g., software systems, very large scale integration (VLSI) devices and circuits, and computer architecture) design, simulate, implement, and evaluate a complete computing system. Typical examples of projects in the current sequence include a pipelined 32-bit RISC processor, a four-cell systolic array processor, and a video game. The goal is to produce simulation and hardware/software codesign as early as possible in the design process. Students execute software on simulation models prior to any hardware implementation. An assembler and a compiler are developed for the new design. Throughout the sequence, students participate in design reviews and must provide documentation of their designs. The final designs are implemented using an array of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) contained in a device called a hardware emulator. This allows for ease of design modifications while still having actual hardware for experimentation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746325/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6178409","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","displayDocTitle":"An undergraduate computer engineering rapid systems prototyping design laboratory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An undergraduate computer engineering rapid systems prototyping design laboratory","sourcePdf":"00746325.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028228S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"25","articleId":"746325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":746326,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Neutron irradiation of DRAMs and SRAMs caused bit errors due to soft errors; however, no errors occurred in FRAMs and flash memories. The irradiation of alpha-rays caused only single-bit-errors, but when neutrons were irradiated, both single-bit-errors and adjacent multi-bit-errors (about 5% of the total) occurred on our results. Soft errors in RAM were estimated not to occur when the energy of the neutron particles is about 5 MeV or less. Two tendencies were identified between the error rate and the collected charge, depending on the device structures. In particular, presence of a triple-well played a significant role for lowering the error rate. Simulation using a simplified two-dimensional model produced results close to the experiment results, in terms of error mode and device configurations.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1998.746376","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1998.

The SIA roadmap projects that future gains in performance will continue to accrue from this approach. One of the guiding principles for miniaturization has been the scaling of successful existing device designs to smaller dimensions. While there may be no compelling reason why the SIA targets cannot be achieved by continued scaling, an accurate assessment of the limiting performance that can be derived from conventional CMOS is crucial for identifying the principal impediments and for developing alternatives. Here, we identify five impediments that we have encountered as we attempt to scale CMOS technology toward 10 nm gate lengths: optical lithography, gate oxide tunneling, enhanced boron diffusion in the ultra-shallow junction, drive current saturation with decreasing oxide thickness, and the subthreshold current.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1998.746433","startPage":"615","endPage":"618","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1998.

Our technology thus offers a shrink factor of 5 versus the actual state of the art in power MOSFETs. The device concept is based on charge compensation in the drift region of the transistor. We increase the doping of the vertical drift region roughly by one order of magnitude and counterbalance this additional charge by the implementation of fine structured columns of the opposite doping type. The blocking voltage of the transistor remains thus unaltered. The charge compensating columns do not contribute to the current conduction during the turn-on state. Nevertheless the drastically increased doping of the drift region allows the above mentioned reduction of the on-resistance.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1998.

Extremely small cell size of 0.44 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ has been obtained with 0.25 /spl mu/m design rule. This cell size is about 30% that of conventional NOR flash cell. To minimize the cell size, the cell gate is patterned with length of 0.25 /spl mu/m, which can be achieved by using channel erasing scheme. STI and 0.15 /spl mu/m floating gate separation can realize a 0.55 /spl mu/m bitline pitch. W sourceline can reduce sourceline resistance and the number of metal sourcelines in the array. In addition, poly-Si gate and active source/drain areas are Ti-silicided at both cells and peripheral transistors, which results in high-speed operation of memory array and peripheral circuits. This high-density NOR cell technology will be essential to realize a low cost and high-performance flash memory and flash embedded logic devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6189814","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1998","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Novel 0.44 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ Ti-salicide STI cell technology for high-density NOR flash memories and high performance embedded application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel 0.44 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ Ti-salicide STI cell technology for high-density NOR flash memories and high performance embedded application","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00746517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051414S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 1998","isNumber":"16109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6036","citationCount":"6","articleId":"746517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":746520,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The main obstacle comes from the low responsivity and unscalability of the photo sensor. In this work, we have designed and fabricated a highly responsive photo sensor from a standard MOSIS HP0.8 /spl mu/m n-well CMOS process. The photo sensor is obtained by connecting the n-well with the n/sup +/ polysilicon gate of a PMOSFET. From the experimental results, the output photo current from a 8.2 /spl mu/m/0.8 /spl mu/m device is of the order of ten /spl mu/A. The self-amplification, which gives the high responsivity can be further increased by technology scaling. A simple 32/spl times/32 sensor array chip has also been fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility for using the new device in a CMOS imaging circuit.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1998.

To improve the short channel effect immunities, a novel folded channel transistor structure is proposed.

The special features of the structure are: (1) a transistor is formed in a vertical ultra-thin Si fin and is controlled by a double-gate, which suppresses short channel effects; (2) the two gates are self-aligned and are aligned to the S/D; (3) S/D is raised to reduce the parasitic resistance; (4) new low-temperature gate or ultra-thin gate dielectric materials can be used because they are deposited after the S/D; and (5) the structure is quasi-planar because the Si fins are relatively short.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1998.746531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1998.746531","endPage":"1034","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1998.

Compared with the classic solution based on synchronous demodulation the resulting accuracy is improved. Heavy filtering is not required, except for the anti-aliasing function. The algorithm decreases the measuring time and offers diagnostic capability.","doi":"10.1109/19.746567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.746567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16119","pdfPath":"/iel4/19/16119/00746567.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Voltage","Signal processing","Magnetic separation","Demodulation","Frequency","Digital signal processors","Circuits","Displacement measurement","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position measurement","electric sensing devices","differential transformers","discrete Fourier transforms","spectral analysis","signal processing equipment","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FFT","signal processing","LVDT position sensors","linear variable differential transformer","spectral estimation","differential secondary signal","floating-point digital signal processor","analog interface circuit","primary signal","secondary signals","synchronous demodulation","filtering","anti-aliasing function","spectral analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of an FFT-based algorithm to signal processing of LVDT position sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746567/","volume":"47","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6171656","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of an FFT-based algorithm to signal processing of LVDT position sensors","sourcePdf":"00746567.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04446S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"16119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"34","articleId":"746567","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":746570,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In a similar manner to that used for the single-input/single-output system, the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system response may be obtained directly from measured input output frequency responses. An investigation of compact multifrequency data measurement signals, which have been extensively cataloged by the authors, has provided compact multifrequency ternary and quaternary input signals that have uncorrelated spectra. They are powerful multisymbol, multilevel computer generated measurement signals whose signal power is concentrated in either two or three dominant harmonics. As the signals, which are given in this paper, have six, seven, or eight symbols in their measurement codes, both the computation time for the frequency estimates and the experimental time are minimized. Two multifrequency quaternary signals with uncorrelated spectra are used to identify a simulated distillation column. It is shown that the cross coupling terms between the measurement channels may be removed by these digital measurement signals with the same number of symbols but different measurement codes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel4/19/16119/00746570.pdf","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/19.746570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.746570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16119","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=746570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncorrelated multisymbol signals for MIMO system identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","MIMO","System identification","Frequency measurement","Frequency estimation","Power generation","Signal generators","Power measurement","Power system harmonics","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","frequency estimation","frequency response","harmonics","distillation","frequency-domain analysis","modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system identification","uncorrelated multisymbol signals","two-input two-output multivariable system","system response","input output frequency responses","compact multifrequency data measurement signals","quaternary input signals","ternary input signals","uncorrelated spectra","multilevel computer generated measurement signals","harmonics","computation time","frequency estimates","simulated distillation column","cross coupling terms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Uncorrelated multisymbol signals for MIMO system identification","volume":"47","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6171659","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncorrelated multisymbol signals for MIMO system identification","sourcePdf":"00746570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"16119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"4","articleId":"746570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":746572,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The procedure is based on the estimation of the spectral components of the autocorrelation function of the input signal through the simultaneous random sampling of the given input signal and its randomly \"delayed copy\". The samples are therefore randomly taken in a double-dimension space, time, and delay. By using a random process in the time domain with a recursive mean previously introduced by the authors in order to avoid any bandwidth limitation due to the sampling strategy, it is shown both theoretically and through simulation that the estimate of the power spectral components is asymptotically unbiased on the unique hypothesis of a synchronized random sampling in the delay domain, i.e., the sampling delays are uniformly distributed in an interval equal to the period of the input signal. The simulation results confirm the theoretical findings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6178382","volume":"47","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A broad-band power spectrum analyzer based on twin-channel delayed sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A broad-band power spectrum analyzer based on twin-channel delayed sampling","sourcePdf":"00746609.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042012S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"16119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"11","articleId":"746609","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":746614,"authors":[{"name":"Haizhuang Kang","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing and Engineering System, Brunei University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK"],"lastName":"Haizhuang Kang","id":"37087300579"},{"name":"Qingping Yang","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing and Engineering System, Brunei University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK"],"lastName":"Qingping Yang","id":"37086967844"},{"name":"C.

The first ANN performs the detection of suspicious regions in a low-resolution image. The input to the second ANN are the curvature peaks computed for all pixels in each suspicious region. This comes from the fact that small tumors possess and identifiable signature in curvature-peak feature space, where curvature is the local curvature of the image data when viewed as a relief map. The output of this network is thresholded at a chosen level of significance to give a positive detection. Tests are performed using 60 radiographs taken from a routine clinic with 90 real nodules and 288 simulated nodules. The authors employed free-response receiver operating characteristics method with the mean number of false positives (FP's) and the sensitivity as performance indexes to evaluate all the simulation results.

The quantitative comparison was made with the linear model and with separation of the available data into training and test sets. The comparison of subjective classification with features from still ultrasound images revealed an overall agreement of 60% for classification of echogenicity and 70% for classification of structure. Comparison of the histologically determined relative volume of soft materials with features from the still images revealed a correlation coefficient of r=-0.42 (p=0.002), for mean echogenicity of the plaque region. The best performing feature was of second order and denoted contrast (r=-0.5). Though significant, the latter correlation is probably not strong enough to be useful for clinical prediction of relative volume of soft materials for individual patients.

The approach utilizes a discretized linear model of the echo data received from the region of interest (ROI) using a conventional beam former. The transmitter array elements are fed with binary codes designed to produce distinct impulse responses from different directions in ROI. Image reconstruction in ROI is achieved with a regularized pseudoinverse operator derived from the linear receive signal model. The reconstruction operator can be implemented using a transversal filter bank with every filter in the bank designed to extract echoes from a specific direction in the ROI. The number of filters in the bank determines the number of image lines acquired simultaneously. In this paper, the authors present images of a cyst phantom reconstructed based on their formulation. A number of issues of practical significance in image reconstruction are addressed. Specifically, an augmented model is introduced to account for imperfect blocking of echoes from outside the ROI. The authors have also introduced a column-weighting algorithm for minimizing the number of filter coefficients. In addition, a detailed illustration of a full image reconstruction using subimage acquisition and compounding is given. Experimental results have shown that the new approach is valid for phased-array pulse-echo imaging of speckle-generating phantoms typically used in characterizing medical imaging systems. Such coded-excitation-based image reconstruction from speckle-generating phantoms, to the best of the authors' knowledge, have not been reported previously.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1998","volume":"17","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6177287","pubMedId":"10048849","publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Filter-based coded-excitation system for high-speed ultrasonic imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter-based coded-excitation system for high-speed ultrasonic imaging","sourcePdf":"00746625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067037S","chronDate":"Dec.  1998","isNumber":"16120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"23","articleId":"746625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":746648,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Furthermore, unlike other SIMD approaches the simulation is not limited to a unit delay model, complex delays such as inertial delays are permissible. The processor has been implemented in Verilog and assessed using ISCAS-85 benchmark. Gate evaluation is executed in constant time, whereas updating fan-out lists expands with circuit size.

Conversion resolutions higher than 10 bits can only be achieved if calibration techniques are employed. In this case, however, this paper demonstrates that multibit, rather than single-bit resolution per-stage architectures have to be considered for optimizing the resulting area and power dissipation while minimizing stringent requirements of the constituting building blocks. Such optimization is achieved through a systematic design process that takes into account physical limitations for practical integrated circuit implementation, including thermal noise and capacitor matching accuracy. The impact of the selected pipelined configuration on the self-calibration requirements as well as on the practical feasibility of the active components is analyzed. An example is presented to consolidate the relevant conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/82.746663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/16127/00746663.pdf","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.746663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic design for optimization of high-speed self-calibrated pipelined A/D converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1998","displayDocTitle":"Systematic design for optimization of high-speed self-calibrated pipelined A/D converters","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6180386","volume":"45","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic design for optimization of high-speed self-calibrated pipelined A/D converters","sourcePdf":"00746663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045132S","chronDate":"Dec 1998","isNumber":"16127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"51","articleId":"746663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":746664,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

These analog realizations are often used because they are smaller and consume less power than their digital counterparts. However, class-IV signaling allows simplifications during Viterbi detection and thus existing analog decoders have limited applications. The purpose of this paper is to develop efficient analog circuits that can be used for general Viterbi detection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the analog portions of two analog Viterbi decoders were fabricated in a 0.8 /spl mu/m BiCMOS process. With an off-chip digital path memory, operation up to 50 Mb/s is demonstrated. However, simulations indicate that with on-chip digital path memory, speeds on the order of 300 Mb/s can be achieved. The power consumption of the proposed approach is estimated to be 15 mW/state drawn from a single 5 V power supply.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Viterbi algorithm","Maximum likelihood decoding","Sequences","Intersymbol interference","Maximum likelihood detection","Detectors","Signal processing algorithms","Analog circuits","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue processing circuits","BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits","Viterbi detection","Viterbi decoding","partial response channels","magnetic disc storage","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS circuits","analog Viterbi decoders","partial-response disk drive application","class-IV signaling","Viterbi detection","efficient analog circuits","offchip digital path memory","power consumption","0.8 micron","50 Mbit/s","5 V","300 Mbit/s"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=746664","doi":"10.1109/82.746664","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/16127/00746664.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.746664","startPage":"1527","endPage":"1537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BiCMOS circuits for analog Viterbi decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BiCMOS circuits for analog Viterbi decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1998","volume":"45","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","accessionNumber":"6180387","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BiCMOS circuits for analog Viterbi decoders","sourcePdf":"00746664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035685S","chronDate":"Dec 1998","isNumber":"16127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"28","articleId":"746664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":746667,"authors":[{"name":"Gunhee Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gunhee Han","id":"37270066200"},{"name":"E.

Despite the large number of papers proposing new CMOS multiplier structures, they can be roughly grouped into a few categories.

The grouping of pixels is dynamic, driven solely by the segmentation criterion at the input.

The new technique, based upon dividing the frequency spectrum into four complementary components and the utilization of four masking filters, achieves large reductions in filter implementation complexity when the transition width of the desired DS filter is very narrow.

Digit-serial architectures obtained using traditional unfolding techniques cannot be pipelined beyond a certain level because of the presence of feedback loops. In this paper, an alternative approach for the design of the digit-serial architectures is presented based on a novel design methodology. This methodology permits bit-level pipelining of the digit-serial architectures by moving all feedback loops to the last stage of the design. This enables bit-level pipelining of digit-serial architectures, thereby achieving sample speeds close to corresponding bit-parallel multipliers with lower area. This increased sample speed can be traded with reduction in power supply voltage resulting in significant reduction in power consumption. The proposed approach is applied to the design of various multipliers which form the backbone of digital signal processing computations. The results show that for transformed multipliers with smaller digit sizes (/spl les/4), the singly-redundant multiplier consumes the least power, and for larger digit sizes, the type-I multiplier consumes the least power. It is also found that the optimum digit size for least power consumption in type-I and type-III multipliers is /spl sim//spl radic/(2W), where W represents the word length. Among the bit-level pipelined digit-serial multipliers, it is found that the redundant multiplier offers the best choice in terms of both latency and power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/82.746672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/16127/00746672.pdf","startPage":"1585","endPage":"1596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.746672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic design of high-speed and low-power digit-serial multipliers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=746672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746672/","displayDocTitle":"Systematic design of high-speed and low-power digit-serial multipliers","volume":"45","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","accessionNumber":"6180392","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic design of high-speed and low-power digit-serial multipliers","sourcePdf":"00746672.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077485S","chronDate":"Dec 1998","isNumber":"16127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"21","articleId":"746672","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":746682,"authors":[{"name":"Zanjun Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Zanjun Lu","id":"37365344700"},{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Derong Liu","id":"37348608400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"746682","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network synthesis","Cellular neural networks","Cloning","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Associative memory","Finite impulse response filter","Constraint theory","Filtering algorithms","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","stability","content-addressable storage","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthesis procedure","cellular neural networks","space-invariant cloning template","design algorithm","associative memories","linear inequalities","perceptron training algorithm","memory patterns","bipolar vectors","symmetric connection matrices","global stability","CNN stability"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new synthesis procedure (design algorithm) for cellular neural networks (CNN's) with a space-invariant cloning template with applications to associative memories.

These schemes typically employ multiple parameters such as threshold values or filter weights to arrive at a detection decision. In order for the system to have high performance, the values of these parameters need to be set optimally. Conventional optimization techniques are designed to optimize a scalar objective function. The task of optimizing the performance of a computerized detection scheme, however, is clearly a multiobjective problem: the authors wish to simultaneously improve the sensitivity and false-positive rate of the system. In this work the authors investigate a multiobjective approach to optimizing computerized rule-based detection schemes. In a multiobjective optimization, multiple objectives are simultaneously optimized, with the objective now being a vector-valued function. The multiobjective optimization problem admits a set of solutions, known as the Pareto-optimal set, which are equivalent in the absence of any information regarding the preferences of the objectives. The performances of the Pareto-optimal solutions can be interpreted as operating points on an optimal free response receiver operating characteristic (FROG) curve, greater than or equal to the points on any possible FROG curve for a given dataset and detection scheme. It is demonstrated that generating FROG curves in this manner eliminates several known problems with conventional FROG curve generation techniques for rule-based detection schemes. The authors employ the multiobjective approach to optimize a rule-based scheme for clustered mirocalcification detection that has been developed in the authors' laboratory.","doi":"10.1109/42.746726","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/16120/00746726.pdf","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1093","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.746726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization and FROC analysis of rule-based detection schemes using a multiobjective approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Optimization and FROC analysis of rule-based detection schemes using a multiobjective approach","volume":"17","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6177305","pubMedId":"10048867","publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization and FROC analysis of rule-based detection schemes using a multiobjective approach","sourcePdf":"00746726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04303S","chronDate":"Dec.  1998","isNumber":"16120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"24","articleId":"746726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":746730,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The convex algorithm is a relatively fast iterative ML algorithm but it is nevertheless too slow for many applications. Therefore, an acceleration of this algorithm by using ordered subsets of projections is proposed [ordered subsets convex algorithm (OSC)]. OSC applies the convex algorithm sequentially to subsets of projections, OSC was compared with the convex algorithm using simulated and physical thorax phantom data. Reconstructions were performed for OSC using eight and 16 subsets (eight and four projections/subset, respectively). Global errors, image noise, contrast recovery, and likelihood increase were calculated. Results show that OSC is faster than the convex algorithm, the amount of acceleration being approximately proportional to the number of subsets in OSC, and it causes only a slight increase of noise and global errors in the reconstructions. Images and image profiles of the reconstructions were in good agreement, In conclusion, OSC and the convex algorithm result in similar image quality but OSC is more than an order of magnitude faster.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.746730","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/16120/00746730.pdf","startPage":"1101","endPage":"1105","doi":"10.1109/42.746730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated iterative transmission CT reconstruction using an ordered subsets convex algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated iterative transmission CT reconstruction using an ordered subsets convex algorithm","volume":"17","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","accessionNumber":"6177309","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"10048870","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746730/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated iterative transmission CT reconstruction using an ordered subsets convex algorithm","sourcePdf":"00746730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038987S","chronDate":"Dec.  1998","isNumber":"16120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"144","articleId":"746730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":746760,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The model is based on the novelty that errors can be expressed as strings over an alphabet of basic error symbols. Some general conditions on errors are defined which bound the error effects on messages, obtaining thus the class of bounded error effects channels (BEE channels). These channels can be used to model, for instance, scattered errors and bursts of errors of any combination of the three error types. A general notion of error-correcting code is defined and a characterization of the error-correcting codes for a given BEE channel is obtained. Then, an algorithm is presented that tests, for a given finite code (not necessarily of fixed length) and a given description of a BEE channel, whether the code is error-correcting for the channel defined by the given description. This result can be considered as an extension of the well-known theorem of Sardinas and Patterson (1953) for testing the unique decodability of a given finite code. In this sense, it can be said that unique decodability is decidable also in the presence of errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","volume":"45","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6192060","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Structural analysis of error-correcting codes for discrete channels that involve combinations of three basic error types","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural analysis of error-correcting codes for discrete channels that involve combinations of three basic error types","sourcePdf":"00746772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062822S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","articleId":"746772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":746773,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The propagation coefficients between pairs of transmitter and receiver antennas are statistically independent and unknown; they remain constant for a coherence interval of T symbol periods, after which they change to new independent values which they maintain for another T symbol periods, and so on. Computing the link capacity, associated with channel coding over multiple fading intervals, requires an optimization over the joint density of T/spl middot/M complex transmitted signals. We prove that there is no point in making the number of transmitter antennas greater than the length of the coherence interval: the capacity for M>T is equal to the capacity for M=T. Capacity is achieved when the T/spl times/M transmitted signal matrix is equal to the product of two statistically independent matrices: a T/spl times/T isotropically distributed unitary matrix times a certain T/spl times/M random matrix that is diagonal, real, and nonnegative. This result enables us to determine capacity for many interesting cases. We conclude that, for a fixed number of antennas, as the length of the coherence interval increases, the capacity approaches the capacity obtained as if the receiver knew the propagation coefficients.","doi":"10.1109/18.746779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16128/00746779.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.746779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of a mobile multiple-antenna communication link in Rayleigh flat fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=746779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of a mobile multiple-antenna communication link in Rayleigh flat fading","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746779/","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6192066","volume":"45","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of a mobile multiple-antenna communication link in Rayleigh flat fading","sourcePdf":"00746779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026483S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"939","articleId":"746779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":746781,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Mei","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","State Key Laboratories of Transducer Technology, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Tao Mei","id":"37273533300"},{"name":"Yu Ge","affiliation":["State Key Laboratories of Transducer Technology, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Yu Ge","id":"37064941200"},{"name":"Yong Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratories of Transducer Technology, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Yong Chen","id":"37367663200"},{"name":"Lin Ni","affiliation":["State Key Laboratories of Transducer Technology, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Lin Ni","id":"37273314700"},{"name":"Wei-Hsin Liao","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wei-Hsin Liao","id":"38182745200"},{"name":"Yangsheng Xu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yangsheng Xu","id":"37277722000"},{"name":"W.J.

The LMBC framework provides a relation between the index bits and the reconstruction vectors through mapping properties. We define a framework, show its flexibility, and give optimality conditions. We consider source optimized vector quantization (VQ), where the objective is to directly obtain a VQ with inherent good channel robustness properties. Several instructive theoretical results and properties of the distortion experienced due to channel noise are demonstrated. These results are used to guide the design process. Both optimization algorithms and a block code selection procedure are devised. Experimental results for Gauss-Markov sources show that quantization performance close to an unconstrained VQ is obtained with a short block code which implies a constrained VQ. The resulting VQs have better channel noise robustness than conventional VQs designed with the generalized Lloyd algorithm (GLA) and splitting initialization, even when a post-processing index assignment algorithm is applied to the GLA-based VQ. We have, thus, demonstrated a unique method for direct design resulting in an inherent good index assignment combined with small losses in quantization performance.","doi":"10.1109/18.746788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16128/00746788.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.746788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust vector quantization by a linear mapping of a block code","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=746788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746788/","displayDocTitle":"Robust vector quantization by a linear mapping of a block code","volume":"45","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6192071","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust vector quantization by a linear mapping of a block code","sourcePdf":"00746788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046122S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"19","articleId":"746788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":746793,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

A new performance criterion called symmetric energy is defined which is a low-noise indicator of the joint error rate that at least one user is detected erroneously. Even the best linear detectors can perform poorly in terms of symmetric energy compared to the maximum-likelihood detector. A general class of decision feedback detectors (DFDs) is defined with O(K) implementational complexity per user. The symmetric energy of arbitrary DFD and bounds on their asymptotic effective energy (AEE) performance are obtained along with an exact bit-error rate and AEE analysis for the decorrelating DFD. The optimum DFD that maximizes symmetric energy is obtained. Each one of the K! optimum, decorrelating, and conventional DFDs, that correspond to the K! orders in which the users can be detected, are shown to outperform the linear optimum, decorrelating, and conventional detectors, respectively, in terms of symmetric energy. Moreover, algorithms are obtained for determining the choice of order of detection for the three DFDs which guarantee that they uniformly (user-wise) outperform their linear counterparts. In addition to optimality in symmetric energy, it is also shown that under certain conditions, the optimum DFD achieves the AEE performance of the exponentially complex maximum-likelihood detector for all users simultaneously. None of the results of this paper make the perfect feedback assumption. The implications of our work on power control for multiuser detection are also discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Multiuser detection","Design for disassembly","Detectors","Decorrelation","Maximum likelihood detection","Gaussian noise","Error analysis","Bit error rate","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","computational complexity","multi-access systems","synchronisation","receivers","signal detection","multiuser channels","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback multiuser detection","systematic approach","joint detection","simultaneously transmitting users","synchronous correlated waveform multiple-access","CWMA channel","Gaussian noise","performance criterion","symmetric energy","low-noise indicator","joint error rate","implementational complexity","asymptotic effective energy","bit-error rate","AEE"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=746793","doi":"10.1109/18.746793","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16128/00746793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.746793","startPage":"219","endPage":"240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision feedback multiuser detection: a systematic approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decision feedback multiuser detection: a systematic approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","volume":"45","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6192072","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision feedback multiuser detection: a systematic approach","sourcePdf":"00746793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059038S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"136","articleId":"746793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":746796,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

Each storage cell is expected to store one of q symbols, and the legal state transitions are described by an arbitrary directed acyclic graph. This memory model can be understood as a generalization of the binary write-once memory which was introduced by Rivest and Shamir (1982). During the process of updating information, the contents of a cell can be changed from a 0-state to a 1-state but not vice versa. We study the problem of reusing a generalized write-once memory for T successive cycles (generations). We determine the zero-error capacity region and the maximum total number of information hits stored in the memory for T consecutive cycles for the situation where the encoder knows and the decoder does not know the previous state of the memory.

To reduce system size and simplify assembly work, the C&C circuit and three lead wires are fabricated on the same substrate using a CMOS-compatible polyimide-based process. The outer diameter of the fabricated active catheter is approximately 2.0 mm. The fabricated C&C IC measures 1.0 mm/spl times/3.35 mm/spl times/0.2 mm. The link addressing and the actuator switching functions of the fabricated chip were confirmed. The minimum access time for addressing and actuating a single unit was 6.4 /spl mu/s.

The key idea of making such a large 3-D diaphragm is in producing a large spherical etch front (2 mm in radius) in a 2 mm thick silicon substrate by an isotropic silicon etching with a 75 /spl mu/m thick cellophane tape as an etch mask. During the isotropic etching, we observe a self-limiting etching behavior caused by the gas bubbles (etch byproducts) which close the etch window and limit the mass transport of the etchant to the silicon etch surface. This self-limiting etching is advantageously used to control the dome diaphragm dimension. One major advantage of a dome diaphragm is that the diaphragm can effectively release residual stress through volumetric change of its shape, and can easily be wrinkle-free and/or crack-free. The fabricated acoustic transducer has been measured to produce a sound output above 70 dB SPL in 10-200 kHz when the transducer is driven by a 11 V/sub rms/ sinusoidal source.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fabrication","Etching","Silicon","Acoustic transducers","Substrates","Electrodes","Zinc oxide","Piezoelectric films","Semiconductor films","Surface cracks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zinc compounds","acoustic transducers","piezoelectric transducers","diaphragms","micromechanical devices","etching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fabrication","circular clamped boundary","silicon substrate","acoustic transducer","silicon nitride dome-shaped diaphragm","ZnO piezoelectric film","self-limiting etching","isotropic etching","MEMS technology","10 to 200 kHz","ZnO","Si","Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1999.746880","publicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

The fabricated chip is the first VLSI-NEMS (NanoEMS) for nanotechnological applications. For electrical and thermal stability, the levers are made of silicon and the heater/sensor element is defined as a lower doped platform with the tip on top. Freestanding cantilevers are obtained with surface micromachining techniques, which result in better mechanical stability and heat sinking of the chip than with bulk micromachining releasing techniques. Two wiring levels interconnect the cantilevers for a time-multiplexed row/column addressing scheme. Two different versions for the array interconnections have been implemented, one with an additional Schottky diode in series with the lever to reduce crosstalk between levers, and one without diodes to investigate various addressing schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/746890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Jan. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6375592","conferenceDate":"21-21 Jan. 1999","displayDocTitle":"VLSI-NEMS chip for AFM data storage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI-NEMS chip for AFM data storage","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00746890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033357S","chronDate":"21-21 Jan. 1999","isNumber":"16111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6037","citationCount":"25","articleId":"746890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":746897,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Several important scaling issues are important in the design of fluid systems at the micro scale including surface to volume ratio, flow regime (Reynolds number) and connection and packaging issues. The authors have developed two microfluidic systems including an integrated capillary electrophoresis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy system and a system for the transport and handling of mammalian embryos. Both glass and polyimide-based systems were built to investigate the integration of capillary electrophoresis (CE) with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Linewidths of 1.4 Hz have been demonstrated in the system. The authors have also designed, built, and tested a micro fluidic system capable of transporting individual, pre-implantation mouse embryos through a network of channels to selected locations. The flow of buffer causes the embryos to roll down the channels. Embryos can be spatially retained and then released or moved to a new location via the manipulation of flows. Typical embryo velocities of 80 /spl mu/m/s were observed for 400 /spl mu/m/s center line fluid velocities.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.746910","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

In addition to having a lower threshold, they find that energy deposition is much more consistent with 100-fs pulses. The authors also compared 100-fs and 200-ps laser pulse effects on the surface and in the bulk of human skin tissue. On the surface, pulses with 100-fs and 200-ps duration leave similar size ablation regions. In the bulk both 100-fs and 200-ps pulses produce cavities, however, 100-fs pulses result in a smaller cavity size. On both the surface and in the bulk 100-fs pulses show less collateral tissue damage than 200-ps pulses.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

In addition, the use of furniture and doors was monitored by magnetic sensors. The system, which included several sensors, was installed in one apartment and monitoring of human behavior was carried out during nine weeks.

It robustly recognizes three purely mental states from on-line spontaneous EEG signals and has them associated to simple commands. Three commands allow to interact intelligently with a computer-based system through task decomposition. Our approach seeks to develop individual interfaces since no two people are the same either physiologically or psychologically. Thus the interface adapts to its owner as its neural classifier learns user-specific filters.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.746998","startPage":"2008","endPage":"2011 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

In contrast to most blind source separation algorithms, our method does not employ higher order statistics. It is shown that in case of EEG signals matched filters can successfully be applied to achieve an excellent signal separation. The proposed algorithm is verified on simulated as well as on real EEG data. Due to the strong prior on the sources introduced by the matched filters, at first glance the application of our algorithm appears to be restricted to EEG data. However, by using different matched filters our method is extendible to any kind of non-white signal. Since the computations are based on second order statistics and the matched filters can be arranged in a parallel structure our algorithm is extremely fast and therefore suitable for on-line applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Oct-1 Nov 1998","conferenceDate":"1-1 Nov. 1998","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6381695","displayDocTitle":"Blind source separation of EEG data using matched filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind source separation of EEG data using matched filters","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00747006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033514S","chronDate":"29 Oct-1 Nov 1998","isNumber":"16113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6018","citationCount":"1","articleId":"747006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":747014,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Wen Ko","affiliation":["Rm.23 8, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Wen Ko","id":"37366976400"},{"name":"Yue-Der Lin","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Yue-Der Lin","id":"37366761700"},{"name":"Hsiao-Wen Chung","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Hsiao-Wen Chung","id":"37366341000"},{"name":"Gwo-Jen Jan","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Gwo-Jen Jan","id":"37276213000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5164-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"}],"articleNumber":"747014","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Detection algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Character recognition","Brain modeling","Feature extraction","Computer displays","Patient monitoring","Robustness","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","medical signal processing","signal classification","feature extraction","radial basis function networks","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EEG spike detection algorithm","artificial neural network","multichannel correlation","automatic spike detection algorithm","signal classification","RBF neural network","single channel recognition","model optimization","receiver operating characteristics analysis","waveform simplification","high noise immunity","feature extraction","multichannel geometric correlation identification","false-positive rate","incidence matrix","threshold value","spike classification","simultaneous maximization","detection sensitivity","detection selectivity","16-channel continuous EEG records","computation time","robust algorithm"]}],"abstract":"An automatic spike detection algorithm for classification of multi-channel EEG signals based on artificial neural network is presented. Radial basis function (RBF) neural network was chosen for single channel recognition, with model optimization using receiver operating characteristics analysis. Waveform simplification was employed for high noise immunity. Feature extraction with as few as three parameters was used as preparation for the inputs to the neural network. Identification of multi-channel geometric correlation was performed to further lower the false-positive rate by using an incidence matrix. Threshold value for spike classification was chosen for simultaneous maximization of detection sensitivity and selectivity. Evaluation with visual analysis in this preliminary study showed a 83% sensitivity using 16-channel continuous EEG records of four patients, while a high false positive rate was found, which was believed to arise from the extensive and exhaustive visual analysis process. The computation time required for spike detection was significantly less than that needed for online display of the signals on the monitor. We believe that the algorithm proposed in this study is robust and that the simple structure of RBF neural network yields high potential for real-time implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An EEG spike detection algorithm using artificial neural network with multi-channel correlation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

There remains, however, a problem that results in stage diagnosis often become unstable, since the contextual relation between the present and adjacent segments is not considered. In this work, a method of diagnosing the sleep stage more accurately is proposed and its performance is evaluated. In the method, additional neural networks processing is combined with the previous system for recognizing the context of stage sequences.

These electrodes were evaluated clinically on volunteers at three medical institutions. The results showed that EEG recordings of active electrodes without skin preparation are the same as that of conventional gold cup electrodes with abrasive preparation. Due to the low lead impedance the 60 Hz and other interferences are smaller. Furthermore, because of the very low input bias current, the active electrode is stable with time. Recordings of two EEG electrodes at the time of application (no abrasion) and 48 hours later showed same signal quality. A multi-electrode attachment system is being developed for easy applications.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.747053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1998.747053","startPage":"2221","endPage":"2224 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The proposed device measures the impacts associated with a fall and monitors the status of the faller to identify whether assistance is required. The device thus distinguishes between a fall-event (faller gets up of their own accord) and a fall-alarm (faller remains down) and transmits an appropriate message to a local intelligence unit (LIU) which is connected to a response network. Fall-event codes provide essential input data for algorithms to determine fall prediction indices (FPI), whilst fall-alarm codes instruct the LIU to automatically notify an appropriate care provider. The device also provides a measure of activity which may be utilised in the automatic calculation of the activities of daily living (ADL), for use by social workers and occupational therapists for continuously determining a person's ability to live independently in the community. It is hoped that such a device will promote an integrated approach to the management of falls by the elderly in the community.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1998.747074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16077","startPage":"1151","endPage":"1154 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

If the effect of normal age-related changes can be better elucidated many of the increasingly popular methods of noninvasive pulse contour analysis could be made more reliable. In this paper, the predictability of age in 200 healthy adults is assessed using a radial basis function (RBF) network. The inputs are the complex coefficients of the Fourier transform of a single normalized pulse together with beat length, pulse and mean pressures, the harmonic at peak energy, and gender. Age is the output. Age predictability using different combinations of these components reveals that the first 27 harmonics contain aging information. Use of pulse pressure and harmonic of peak energy improved prediction, while mean pressure, beat length, and gender did not. These results suggest that age-related pulse contour changes in healthy adults are due to pulse pressure rather than absolute pressure, and energy shifts in the frequency distribution rather than changes in heart rate.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.747125","startPage":"1333","endPage":"1336 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Simple statistical parameters derived from these transforms and from reconstructed filtered signals were used as inputs to a neural network with no hidden units and a softmax output stage. We used multiple runs of 10 fold cross validation to obtain estimates of classifier performance. Best results were obtained for the db 10 parameters when age and sex were also added. Overall accuracy was 68.8/spl plusmn/0.6%. These results are comparable to those derived from neural nets trained with over 229 scalar parameters (70.9/spl plusmn/0.6%) and were derived at much lower computational cost.

The overall aims is to compensate for image degradation due to photon scattering and photon penetration through the collimated gamma camera to allow more accurate measurement of radiotracers in vivo. In this work, fuzzy rules are generated to train a membership function using a least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. This membership function allows one to describe rules to differentiate gray levels differences, so that the regularizer parameter can be optimally adjusted, based on the fuzzy membership value. The relative performance of this algorithm is compared to a previously reported neural network based hybrid filter by the authors (Wei Qian et al., 1993-8) using both simulated images with different noise levels and experimentally acquired nuclear images using a gamma camera. The improved signal to noise ratio (/spl Delta/SNR) is used for quantitative measurement. The proposed method has proved to be useful in quantitative imaging using a gamma camera for the planar and tomographic imaging mode using single photon emitters, beta emitters (bremsstrahlung detection) and positron 511 keV imaging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Oct-1 Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747133/","accessionNumber":"6351822","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-1 Nov. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-logic adaptive neural networks for nuclear medicine image restorations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-logic adaptive neural networks for nuclear medicine image restorations","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00747133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039021S","chronDate":"29 Oct-1 Nov 1998","isNumber":"16077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6018","citationCount":"3","articleId":"747133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":747142,"authors":[{"name":"Junbo Li","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Junbo Li","id":"37087280275"},{"name":"Mingxi Wan","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Mingxi Wan","id":"37087280355"},{"name":"Ming Qian","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Ming Qian","id":"37087374965"},{"name":"Jingzhi Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Jingzhi Cheng","id":"37087337325"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5164-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"}],"articleNumber":"747142","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=747142","abstract":"A novel ultrasound method for remote measurement of tissue elasticity is proposed.

Our goal was to design a classifier for categorising the Frank lead ECG as normal or one of six disease conditions. The database used in this study contained 500, 100% accurate Frank lead ECG recordings with each recording represented by 229 features. We chose to build a classifier which modelled the Bayesian posterior probabilities by using a neural network with no hidden units and a softmax output stage. Maximum likelihood estimates of the network parameters were established by minimising the log-likelihood error function. Two techniques were used to optimise the classifier. Firstly, outputs for multiple networks trained on random subsamples of the training data were combined and secondly, we looked at reducing the number of features processed by the classifier by using principle component analysis. We found that combining multiple networks increased accuracy but reducing the dimension of the feature data did not increase overall accuracy. Multiple runs of ten fold cross validation were used to determine the accuracy of the classifier and the best configuration of our classifier achieved an accuracy of 70.9/spl plusmn/0.6%.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.747150","startPage":"1422","endPage":"1425 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The relation between discharge frequency of /spl alpha/ motoneuron and that of cortex output cells of the model was investigated. Two types of neural network model were constructed. One consists of 100 or more motor units (model A). The other consists of the same number of motor units and Renshaw cells (model B). For the model A, the discharge frequency of /spl alpha/ motoneuron increased almost linearly with increasing that of motor cortex output cells. All of /spl alpha/ motoneuron showed this properties. For the model B, the discharge frequency of /spl alpha/ motoneuron did not increase so much as that for model A. The shape of the discharge frequency curve, /spl alpha/ motoneuron versus cortex output cell, of the model B was similar to that of /spl alpha/ motoneuron firing rate versus force curve observed in monkey or human skeletal muscle. However, while small-sized /spl alpha/ motoneuron fired, middleand large sized /spl alpha/ motoneuron did not fire. It seems that Renshaw cells in model B had too strong inhibition for /spl alpha/ motoneuron. These results suggest that inhibition of Renshaw cells play an important role in recruitment of motor units.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.747152","startPage":"1430","endPage":"1433 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Nine healthy subjects were asked to use their left hand to make fast and accurate movements in a tracking task of 75 identical steps, by either wrist flexion and extension, or the precision grip. The electromyogram (EMG) activity of 8 finger and hand muscles were simultaneously recorded by standard techniques. Onset timing of muscle activities were quantified from the digitized EMG signals, and were then used as the inputs to the MLP network. Reaction time was also measured, providing the desired output of the network. The trained network captured salient features of the relationship between EMG onset times and reaction time.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1998.747153","startPage":"1434","endPage":"1437 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Due to the local processing philosophy in the CNN paradigm, the detailed and well-established knowledge of local stereogram properties is of high importance. The paper gives an algorithmic definition for synthetic stereograms; a means for structural analysis of different types of random stereograms. In order to confine the generally propagating effect of three-dimensional (3-D) surface features into a restricted neighborhood in a stereogram, the concept of difference stereograms and the related difference surface is introduced for coding local surface variations into stereograms. The difference stereogram with its local structure, is especially suitable for CNN processing, and it is closely connected to the pattern projection technique of depth extraction.","doi":"10.1109/81.747192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/16129/00747192.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.747192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structural analysis of stereograms for CNN depth detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=747192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747192/","displayDocTitle":"Structural analysis of stereograms for CNN depth detection","volume":"46","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6180379","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural analysis of stereograms for CNN depth detection","sourcePdf":"00747192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040045S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"2","articleId":"747192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":747195,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The algorithm we propose, is an energy-based method using a novel wideband velocity-tuned filter which proves to be an efficient alternative to the well-known Gabor filters.

We give a rigorous definition of absolute and relative robustness and show that all well-defined CNN tasks are characterized by a finite set of linear and homogeneous inequalities. This system of inequalities can be analytically solved for the most robust template by simple matrix algebra. For the relative robustness of a task, a theoretical upper bound exists and is easily derived, whereas the absolute robustness can be arbitrarily increased by template scaling. A series of examples demonstrates the simplicity and broad applicability of the proposed method.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/16129/00747207.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An exact and direct analytical method for the design of optimally robust CNN templates","doi":"10.1109/81.747207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.747207","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=747207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"An exact and direct analytical method for the design of optimally robust CNN templates","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6187129","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An exact and direct analytical method for the design of optimally robust CNN templates","sourcePdf":"00747207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042585S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"43","articleId":"747207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":747209,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In particular, a generic method for finding nonpropagating binary-output CNN templates is proposed. This method is based on measurements of actual CNN-UM chips and combines adaptive optimization and decomposition of theoretically ideal CNN templates in order to correct the erroneous behavior of actual CNN-UM chips, which is mainly caused by imperfections introduced during fabrication. More specifically, the entire array of cells in a CNN-UM chip is modeled by a single feed-forward virtual cell whose optimal parameters are found by a simple and effective gradient-based method. In the case of binary input-output uncoupled templates (or Boolean operators), a systematic template decomposition method is applied whenever optimization fails to find a correctly working CNN template for all possible combinations of local 3/spl times/3 binary input patterns. The resulting templates are finally combined, yielding a simple CNN analogic algorithm. Examples are presented for both binary- and analog-input operators, using two concrete stored-program CNN-UM chips to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, whose advantages and limitations are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6180383","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"46","issue":"2","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant design of analogic CNN templates and algorithms-Part I: The binary output case","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant design of analogic CNN templates and algorithms-Part I: The binary output case","sourcePdf":"00747209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066159S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"20","articleId":"747209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":747212,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A light-tree is a point-to-multipoint generalization of a lightpath. A lightpath is a point-to-point all-optical wavelength channel connecting a transmitter at a source node to a receiver at a destination node. Lightpath communication can significantly reduce the number of hops (or lightpaths) a packet has to traverse; and this reduction can, in turn, significantly improve the network's throughput. We extend the lightpath concept by incorporating an optical multicasting capability at the routing nodes in order to increase the logical connectivity of the network and further decrease its hop distance. We refer to such a point-to-multipoint extension as a light-tree. Light-trees can not only provide improved performance for unicast traffic, but they naturally can better support multicast traffic and broadcast traffic. In this study, we shall concentrate on the application and advantages of light-trees to unicast and broadcast traffic. We formulate the light-tree-based virtual topology design problem as an optimization problem with one of two possible objective functions: for a given traffic matrix, (i) minimize the network-wide average packet hop distance, or (ii) minimize the total number of transceivers in the network. We demonstrate that an optimum light-tree-based virtual topology has clear advantages over an optimum lightpath-based virtual topology with respect to the above two objectives.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6178590","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Light trees: optical multicasting for improved performance in wavelength routed networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light trees: optical multicasting for improved performance in wavelength routed networks","sourcePdf":"00747251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040773S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"396","articleId":"747251","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":747252,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The first and most important requirement of future transport networks is the large bandwidth transport capability which enables the paradigm shift. In addition, requirements for new service attributes are becoming more tangible. Furthermore, high reliability will be indispensable because the multimedia network will be the basis for the information society. To develop the robust and efficient networks that satisfy the requirements above, new network architectures and technologies should be developed. Photonic networks employing dense WDM technologies appear to be the solution. In this article, first the basic concept of the future photonic network is depicted. Next, the capability of large-capacity fiber transmission is shown. The critical degradation factor of fiber nonlinearity is analyzed, and the effectiveness of distributed amplification is quantitatively demonstrated. Furthermore, advances in fiber amplifiers which greatly widen the usable fiber window are shown.

Additionally, communication systems like 3G that must support multimode flexibility, such as the software radio, must be able to reconfigure their signal processing chains while keeping circuit complexity to a minimum. Given these constraints, DSP is the only viable alternative for baseband processing and digital IF processing. DSP is in many cases the only viable alternative to analog IF processing. Digital IF affords greater flexibility and higher performance in terms of attenuation and selectivity.

It initially employs Lagrangian relaxation technique to obtain the commitment schedule by relaxing the demand constraint, spinning reserve constraint and every unit ramp rate constraint. Using the forward dispatch, dispatch modification and backward dispatch, a generation schedule which satisfies the spinning reserve requirement and the ramp rate limits is obtained. This schedule is updated by the probabilistic reserve assessment to meet a given risk index. The optimal value of the risk index is selected based on the tradeoff between the total unit commitment schedule cost and the expected cost of energy not served. Finally, a unit decommitment technique is incorporated to solve the problem of reserve over-commitment in Lagrangian relaxation based unit commitment.

There exist all sorts of different demand management programs that utilities use. A critical issue is the incentive paid to the customer to participate in demand management programs and provide load relief. The utility has to design cost effective yet attractive demand management contracts. The main goal is to get load relief when needed. If the contracts are designed to be cost effective they can help the utility reduce costs. Customers sign up for programs when the benefits they derive in the form of up front payments and interruption payments exceeds their cost of interruption. In order to design such contracts, mechanism design with revelation principle is adopted from game theory and applied to the interaction between a utility and its customers. The idea behind mechanism design is to design a program incentive structure that encourages customers to reveal their true value of power (and thus, the value of power interruptibility) without the need to explicitly have customers declare the value. This economic analysis is combined with power system sensitivity analysis to help determine the value of interruptibility for each system location.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing cost effective demand management contracts using game theory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society. 1999 Winter Meeting (Cat.

The key idea is to set up a Hopfield-type network using the negative dual as its energy function. This network is connected to \"neuron-based dynamic programming modules\" that make full use of the DP structure to solve individual unit subproblems. The overall network is proved to be stable, and the difficulties in handling integer variables, subproblem constraints, and subproblem local minima plaguing current neural network methods are avoided. Unit commitment solutions are thus natural results of network convergence. Software simulation using data sets from Northeast Utilities demonstrates that the results are much better than what has been reported in the neural network literature, and the method can provide near-optimal solutions for practical problems. Furthermore, the method has the potential to be implemented in hardware with much improved quality and speed.","doi":"10.1109/PESW.1999.747504","startPage":"490","endPage":"495 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society. 1999 Winter Meeting (Cat.

The structure and strategy behind a portfolio of contracts enables NGC as the grid operator to despatch and utilise these services to facilitate reliable and economic system operation within prescribed supply quality standards. This paper addresses some of the key measures taken to identify the system requirements for frequency control services and technical contractual mechanisms put in place for establishing the capability of generating plant to provide these services.

However, the nonlinear controller has not been implemented in real systems, only in simulations, because it takes the load angle information as the input of this controller. This paper presents nonlinear excitation control for improving electric power system transient stability using a neural network (NN). The NN models the nonlinear excitation controller using only measurable state variables from the synchronous generators in power systems. Therefore, the proposed method can realize nonlinear excitation control which does not require load angle information of the synchronous generator. On the other hand, gains of the nonlinear excitation controllers modeled by NN are optimized by using a genetic algorithm (GA). This gain tuning method using a GA can decide the gains of each nonlinear excitation controller in a large power system at once.","doi":"10.1109/PESW.1999.747527","pdfPath":"/iel4/6033/16105/00747527.pdf","startPage":"622","endPage":"627 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society. 1999 Winter Meeting (Cat.

The approach presented builds up on the IQML algorithm suggested by Bresler and Macovski (1986) for the case of narrowband DOA estimation. It is shown that the concept of an ARMA model for the observed data vector for the narrowband case can be generalized to model an appropriately stacked, space-time data vector obtained by combining the space-time samples. The coefficients of the corresponding 2-D predictor polynomial can be used to represent the null subspace of the wideband array steering matrix, and rooting of the polynomial at each frequency, separately, gives the DOA estimates. These separate estimates at multiple frequencies are combined into a single DOA estimate in a least squares sense. This leads to the formulation of an IQML like procedure for the spatial parameter estimation of wideband sources. Like its narrowband counterpart, the proposed approach is applicable to both noncoherent and coherent sources. The performance of the proposed method is studied via extensive computer simulations and by comparison with the Cramer-Rao bounds.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.747770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16138","startPage":"619","endPage":"629","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/16138/00747770.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOA estimation of wideband sources using a harmonic source model and uniform linear array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"DOA estimation of wideband sources using a harmonic source model and uniform linear array","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6193696","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA estimation of wideband sources using a harmonic source model and uniform linear array","sourcePdf":"00747770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044013S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","articleId":"747770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":747772,"authors":[{"name":"C.B.

The input and output of the unknown system are corrupted by additive independent noises. Gaussian models are used for all inputs. Two competing adaptation schemes are analyzed. The first is a sequential adaptation scheme where the LMS algorithm is first used to estimate the linear portion of the unknown system. The LMS algorithm is able to identify the linear portion of the unknown system to within a scale factor. The weights are then frozen at the end of the first adaptation phase. Recursions are derived for the mean and fluctuation behavior of the LMS algorithm, which are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. When the nonlinearity is modeled by a scaled error function, the second part of the sequential gradient identification scheme is shown to correctly learn the scale factor and the error function scale factor. Mean recursions for the scale factors show good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. For slow learning, the stationary points of the gradient algorithm closely agree with the stationary points of the theoretical recursions. The second adaptive scheme simultaneously learns both the linear and nonlinear portions of the unknown channel. The mean recursions for the linear and nonlinear portions show good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations for slow learning.

Our proposed structure can produce MD-LPPUFBs whose filters all have the region of support /spl Nscr/(M/spl Xi/), where M and /spl Xi/ are the decimation and positive integer diagonal matrices, respectively, and /spl Nscr/(N) denotes the set of integer vectors in the fundamental parallelepiped of a matrix N. It is shown that if /spl Nscr/(M) is reflection invariant with respect to some center, then the reflection invariance of /spl Nscr/(M/spl Xi/) is guaranteed. This fact is important in constructing MD linear-phase filter banks because the reflection invariance is necessary for any linear-phase filter. Since our proposed system structurally restricts both the paraunitary and linear-phase properties, an unconstrained optimization process can be used to design MD-LPPUFBs. Our proposed structure is developed for both an even and an odd number of channels and includes the conventional 1-D system as a special case. It is also shown to be minimal, and the no-DC-leakage condition is presented.

We derive a characterization of candidate convergent points for a family of blind criteria which appeal, tacitly or wittingly, to maximizing the ratio of different sequence norms of the combined channel-equalizer impulse response. This may be accomplished in a practical implementation by using equalizer output cumulants of different orders. The popular Godard and Shalvi-Weinstein schemes are accommodated at one extreme of the family of criteria. We also show that each maximum at the other extreme of the family, involving progressively higher order output cumulants, yields, precisely, a Wiener response. This suggests that blind algorithms using progressively higher order statistics may converge more closely to a Wiener response than those using more modest order statistics. We show, moreover, that the superexponential family of algorithms is also included and establish a convergence proof for undermodeled cases that appeals to no approximation. Finally, some apparently novel bounds on attainable open-eye measures in undermodeled cases are also derived.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Higher order statistics","Image converters","Approximation algorithms","Convergence","Channel capacity","Delay","Degradation","Image restoration","Background noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient response","higher order statistics","blind equalisers","convergence of numerical methods","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["undermodeled equalization","stationary points","blind criteria family","performance","channel equalization","characterization","convergent points","sequence norms","combined channel-equalizer impulse response","output cumulants","Godard scheme","Shalvi-Weinstein scheme","Wiener response","blind algorithms","higher order statistics","superexponential family","attainable open-eye measures"]}],"doi":"10.1109/78.747781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/16138/00747781.pdf","startPage":"760","endPage":"770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.747781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Undermodeled equalization: a characterization of stationary points for a family of blind criteria","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=747781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Undermodeled equalization: a characterization of stationary points for a family of blind criteria","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747781/","volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6187028","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Undermodeled equalization: a characterization of stationary points for a family of blind criteria","sourcePdf":"00747781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052083S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","articleId":"747781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":747782,"authors":[{"name":"N.D.

Since maximization of the likelihood function is analytically intractable, a novel coordinate ascent algorithm is used to obtain sequential updates of the data symbols and all unknown nuisance parameters. The novelty of the algorithm is due to the use of a multiresolution expansion of the received signal and the use of polynomial rooting in the complex plane in place of a line search over the signal delay parameter. The multiresolution structure of the algorithm is exploited to reduce sensitivity to impulsive noise via wavelet thresholding. Computer simulations of the single-user system show that the algorithm has fast convergence, and comparison with theoretical lower bounds establishes that the algorithm achieves nearly optimal error performance.","doi":"10.1109/78.747786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/16138/00747786.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.747786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A maximum likelihood digital receiver using coordinate ascent and the discrete wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=747786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747786/","displayDocTitle":"A maximum likelihood digital receiver using coordinate ascent and the discrete wavelet transform","volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6187033","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A maximum likelihood digital receiver using coordinate ascent and the discrete wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00747786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068788S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","articleId":"747786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":747787,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The moduli 2/sup n(i)/-1 and 2/sup n(i)/+1 are called conjugates of each other. The new RNSs that rely on pairs of conjugate moduli result in hardware-efficient two-level implementations for the weighted-to-RNS and RNS-to-weighted conversions, achieve very large dynamic ranges, and imply fast and efficient RNS processing. When compared with conventional systems of the same number of moduli and the same dynamic range, the proposed new systems offer the following benefits: (1) hardware savings of 25 to 40% for the weighted-to-RNS conversion and (2) a reduction of over 80% in the complexity of the final Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) involved in the RNS-to-weighted conversion. Thus, significant compromises between large dynamic ranges, fast internal processing, and low complexity are achieved by the new systems.","doi":"10.1109/78.747787","startPage":"826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/16138/00747787.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.747787","endPage":"838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation issues of the two-level residue number system with pairs of conjugate moduli","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747787/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Implementation issues of the two-level residue number system with pairs of conjugate moduli","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6187034","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation issues of the two-level residue number system with pairs of conjugate moduli","sourcePdf":"00747787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033317S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"50","articleId":"747787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":747790,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

Because of this, all circuits between the output of the modulator and the input of the demodulator must be linear within a large dynamic range to avoid distortions and spectral spreading. It is therefore desirable to limit the PAPR of the multicarrier signal. A method based on amplitude limiting and forward error correcting (AL-FEC) coding is proposed for reduction of the PAPR. The performance of the AL-FEC is compared to two methods, based on block coding, specially constructed to reduce the PAPR. The AL-FEC is superior as compared to the existing methods. Moreover, its practical realization is very simple for any number of carriers.","doi":"10.1109/26.747808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16137/00747808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.747808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16137","startPage":"18","endPage":"21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of peak factor in orthogonal multicarrier modulation by amplitude limiting and coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=747808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of peak factor in orthogonal multicarrier modulation by amplitude limiting and coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6184995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of peak factor in orthogonal multicarrier modulation by amplitude limiting and coding","sourcePdf":"00747808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033518S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"92","articleId":"747808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":747809,"authors":[{"name":"Dong In Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Seoul, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong In Kim","id":"37279315300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"747809","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":126},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","Modulation coding","Biorthogonal modulation","Error correction codes","Multiaccess communication","Interference","Error correction","Demodulation","Bit error rate","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","pulse position modulation","sequences","cellular radio","multiuser channels","correlation methods","radio receivers","Hadamard codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary pulse position modulation","biorthogonal modulation","direct-sequence code division multiple access","DS-CDMA systems","user-specific spreading sequence","biorthogonal spreading sequences","signal space","global space","interference","cross correlation properties","multi-user performance","M-ary orthogonal modulation","performance","receiver structure","Walsh/Hadamard orthogonal codes","M/4-ary orthogonal codes"]}],"abstract":"A novel modulation format is proposed for cellular direct-sequence CDMA systems where a user-specific spreading sequence is binary pulse position and biorthogonally modulated to form a set of biorthogonal spreading sequences.

Direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) is a multiple access technique that is well suited to provide multirate access. Thus, in this paper, multirate communication systems are considered for the transmission of DS/CDMA wireless signals. Performance for maximum-likelihood-based detection is studied in the context of two multirate access methodologies: multicode access, where high data rate users multiplex their information streams onto multiple codes; and variable spreading length access where signature sequences of different lengths are assigned to users with different data rates. Various maximum-likelihood-based detection schemes for the variable spreading length system are considered as they can achieve near-optimal performance and thus provide reference points for comparison with suboptimal schemes. In addition, asymptotic multiuser performance measures are calculated and bounded to compare performance of the two systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16137/00747814.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.747814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.747814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16137","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=747814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of maximum-likelihood-based detection for two multirate access schemes for CDMA signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Decorrelation","Context","Electrical resistance measurement","Maximum likelihood detection","Data communication","Mobile communication","Fading","Network topology","Telephony"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","maximum likelihood detection","multiuser channels","variable length codes","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum-likelihood-based detection","multirate access schemes","CDMA signals","wireless systems","information sources","data rates","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access","DS/CDMA","multirate communication systems","multicode access","multiple codes","variable spreading length access","signature sequences","asymptotic multiuser performance measures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of maximum-likelihood-based detection for two multirate access schemes for CDMA signals","volume":"47","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6185001","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of maximum-likelihood-based detection for two multirate access schemes for CDMA signals","sourcePdf":"00747814.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035915S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"88","articleId":"747814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":747815,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The near-far resistance is obtained by estimating the a priori unknown propagation delay using a subspace-based technique. Quantities obtained in the estimation procedure are used to design a filter used for suppression of interference, according to the minimum mean square error criterion. Either a decision feedback technique or a simple two-state Viterbi algorithm is subsequently used for the data demodulation in the uncoded case.

A user mobility model has been proposed and its statistical parameters have been derived. Both fixed channel allocation (FCA) and dynamic channel allocation (DCA) techniques have been considered. Moreover, in order to reduce the handover failure probability, we have assumed that interbeam handover requests which do not immediately obtain service can be queued. In particular, two different queuing disciplines have been compared: (a) the first input first output (FIFO) scheme and (b) a new technique called last useful instant (LUI) which is based on the knowledge of the maximum time within which the handover procedure must be accomplished. Implementation aspects for the LUI technique in a LEO-MSS have been discussed also in comparison with the measurement-based priority scheme (MBPS), previously proposed in the literature on this subject. The efficiency of the LUI queuing scheme as regards the FIFO technique has been investigated by simulations for both DCA and FCA techniques. An analytical approach has been also presented in order to allow the performance evaluation of the FCA scheme with different handover queuing disciplines.","doi":"10.1109/26.747816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16137/00747816.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.747816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handover queuing strategies with dynamic and fixed channel allocation techniques in low Earth orbit mobile satellite systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=747816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747816/","displayDocTitle":"Handover queuing strategies with dynamic and fixed channel allocation techniques in low Earth orbit mobile satellite systems","volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6185003","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handover queuing strategies with dynamic and fixed channel allocation techniques in low Earth orbit mobile satellite systems","sourcePdf":"00747816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061152S","chronDate":"Jan.  1999","isNumber":"16137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"73","articleId":"747816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":747817,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

The RAKE receiver used in existing systems suffers from significant performance degradation due to the rapid channel variations encountered under fast fading. We show that the Doppler spread induced by temporal channel variations in fact provides another means for diversity that can be further exploited to combat fading. We develop the concept of Doppler diversity and propose a framework that exploits joint multipath-Doppler diversity in an optimal fashion. Performance analysis shows that even the relatively small Doppler spreads encountered in practice can be leveraged into significant diversity gains via our approach. The framework is applicable in several mobile wireless multiple access systems and can provide substantial performance improvement over existing systems.","doi":"10.1109/26.747819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16137/00747819.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.747819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint multipath-Doppler diversity in mobile wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=747819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747819/","displayDocTitle":"Joint multipath-Doppler diversity in mobile wireless communications","volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6185006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint multipath-Doppler diversity in mobile wireless communications","sourcePdf":"00747819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052372S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"251","articleId":"747819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":747820,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chung Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Li-Chung Chu","id":"37366336300"},{"name":"U.

Traditional sources include transferred arcs, plasma torches, corona discharges, and dielectric barrier discharges. In arcs and torches, the electron and neutral temperatures exceed 3000/spl deg/C and the densities of charge species range from 10/sup 16/-10/sup 19/ cm/sup -3/. Due to the high gas temperature, these plasmas are used primarily in metallurgy. Corona and dielectric barrier discharges produce nonequilibrium plasmas with gas temperatures between 50-400/spl deg/C and densities of charged species typical of weakly ionized gases. However, since these discharges are nonuniform, their use in materials processing is limited. Recently, an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet has been developed, which exhibits many characteristics of a conventional, low-pressure glow discharge. In the jet, the gas temperature ranges from 25-200/spl deg/C, charged-particle densities are 10/sup 11/-10/sup 12/ cm/sup -3/, and reactive species are present in high concentrations, i.e., 10-100 ppm. Since this source may be scaled to treat large areas, it could be used in applications which have been restricted to vacuum. In this paper, the physics and chemistry of the plasma jet and other atmospheric-pressure sources are reviewed.","doi":"10.1109/27.747887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.747887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel4/27/16145/00747887.pdf","startPage":"1685","endPage":"1694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The atmospheric-pressure plasma jet: a review and comparison to other plasma sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1998","displayDocTitle":"The atmospheric-pressure plasma jet: a review and comparison to other plasma sources","volume":"26","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","accessionNumber":"6158137","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/747887/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The atmospheric-pressure plasma jet: a review and comparison to other plasma sources","sourcePdf":"00747887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061009S","chronDate":"Dec 1998","isNumber":"16145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"972","articleId":"747887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":747902,"authors":[{"name":"B.

These networks suffer from splitting, coupling, and attenuation losses. Since there is an upper bound on transmitter power and a lower bound on receiver sensitivity, optical amplifiers are usually required to compensate for the power losses mentioned above. Due to the high cost of amplifiers, it is desirable to minimize their total number in the network. However, an optical amplifier has constraints on the maximum gain and the maximum output power it can supply; thus, optical amplifier placement becomes a challenging problem. In fact, the general problem of minimizing the total amplifier count is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem. Previous studies have attacked the amplifier-placement problem by adding the \"artificial\" constraint that all wavelengths, which are present at a particular point in a fiber, be at the same power level. This constraint simplifies the problem into a solvable mixed-integer linear program. Unfortunately, this artificial constraint can miss feasible solutions that have a lower amplifier count but do not have the equally powered wavelengths constraint. In this paper, we present a method to solve the minimum-amplifier-placement problem, while avoiding the equally powered wavelength constraint. We demonstrate that, by allowing signals to operate at different power levels, our method can reduce the number of amplifiers required.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1998","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","accessionNumber":"6159942","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing amplifier placements in a multiwavelength optical LAN/MAN: the unequally powered wavelengths case","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing amplifier placements in a multiwavelength optical LAN/MAN: the unequally powered wavelengths case","sourcePdf":"00748087.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035467S","chronDate":"Dec 1998","isNumber":"16154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"25","articleId":"748087","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":748092,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohua Jia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Xiaohua Jia","id":"37087142268"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6692"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2566"}],"articleNumber":"748092","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":108,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":138},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Association for Computing Machinery","url":"http://www.acm.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed algorithm of delay-bounded multicast routing for multimedia applications in wide area networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748092","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed algorithms","Delay","Routing","Costs","Multicast algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Wide area networks","Intelligent networks","Real time systems","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia communication","wide area networks","distributed algorithms","telecommunication network routing","delays","multicast communication","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithm","delay-bounded multicast routing","multimedia applications","wide area networks","source node","optimal network cost","bounded delay","distributed heuristic algorithm","routing trees","suboptimal network cost","messages","convergence time","dynamic membership changes"]}],"abstract":"Multicast routing is to find a tree which is rooted from a source node and contains all multicast destinations. There are two requirements of multicast routing in many multimedia applications: optimal network cost and bounded delay. The network cost of a tree is defined as the sum of the cost of all links in the tree. The bounded delay of a routing tree refers to the feature that the accumulated delay from the source to any destination along the tree shall not exceed a prespecified bound. This paper presents a distributed heuristic algorithm which generates routing trees having a suboptimal network cost under the delay bound constraint. The proposed algorithm is fully distributed, efficient in terms of the number of messages and convergence time, and flexible in dynamic membership changes. A large amount of simulations have been done to show the network cost of the routing trees generated by our algorithm is similar to, or even better than, other existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/90.748092","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/16154/00748092.pdf","startPage":"828","endPage":"837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.748092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1998","displayDocTitle":"A distributed algorithm of delay-bounded multicast routing for multimedia applications in wide area networks","volume":"6","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","accessionNumber":"6159946","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748092/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed algorithm of delay-bounded multicast routing for multimedia applications in wide area networks","sourcePdf":"00748092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048367S","chronDate":"Dec 1998","isNumber":"16154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"108","articleId":"748092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":748093,"authors":[{"name":"Seok-Kyu Kweon","affiliation":["Real-Time Computing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Technical University of Munich, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Seok-Kyu Kweon","id":"37282905800"},{"name":"K.G.

In particular, per-packet (per-cell) delay guarantees are an important QoS requirement for real-time applications. Although several methods have been proposed to provide delay guarantees in packet-switching networks, they are either too complex for ATM networks which allow only very simple operations to achieve high bandwidths (hence, high-speed switching and routing), or too inefficient (in using network resources) to be cost effective. In this paper, we propose a cell-multiplexing scheme for the real-time communication service in ATM networks. The proposed scheme achieves an efficiency close to that of packet-by-packet generalized processor sharing, and incurs an implementation cost similar to that of rate controlled static priority queueing. It employs the leaky bucket model as the input traffic description model and regulates the input traffic at the user network interface to follow the input traffic specification. Inside the network, it consists of two components, traffic controller and scheduler. The function of the traffic controller is to shape real-time traffic to have the same input pattern at every switch along the path. The end-to-end delay is bounded by the scheduler which employs a nonpreemptive rate-monotonic priority scheduling policy at each switch on the path. The proposed scheme is compared to three other popular schemes with MPEG-coded movie clips. Finally, we present a hardware implementation of the proposed scheme based on a systolic array priority queue.","doi":"10.1109/90.748093","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/16154/00748093.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.748093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748093/","displayDocTitle":"Providing deterministic delay guarantees in ATM networks","volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","accessionNumber":"6159947","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing deterministic delay guarantees in ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00748093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058631S","chronDate":"Dec 1998","isNumber":"16154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"18","articleId":"748093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":748098,"authors":[{"name":"L.Y.

The GaAs MSM photodetectors flip-chip mounted on the top of OE-MCM substrate showed a low dark current of about 10 nA and a high responsivity of 0.33 A/W.","doi":"10.1109/2944.748115","startPage":"119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/2944/16152/00748115.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.748115","endPage":"126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flip-chip packaging using micromachined conductive polymer bumps and alignment pedestals for MOEMS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748115/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Flip-chip packaging using micromachined conductive polymer bumps and alignment pedestals for MOEMS","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6190698","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flip-chip packaging using micromachined conductive polymer bumps and alignment pedestals for MOEMS","sourcePdf":"00748115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055683S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1999","isNumber":"16152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"25","articleId":"748115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":748118,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The proposed approach is based on the introduction of an auditory model in a subtractive-type enhancement process. Single channel subtractive-type algorithms are characterized by a tradeoff between the amount of noise reduction, the speech distortion, and the level of musical residual noise, which can be modified by varying the subtraction parameters. Classical algorithms are usually limited to the use of fixed optimized parameters, which are difficult to choose for all speech and noise conditions. A new computationally efficient algorithm is developed based on masking properties of the human auditory system. It allows for an automatic adaptation in time and frequency of the parametric enhancement system, and finds the best tradeoff based on a criterion correlated with perception. This leads to a significant reduction of the unnatural structure of the residual noise. Objective and subjective evaluation of the proposed system is performed with several noise types form the Noisex-92 database, having different time-frequency distributions. The application of objective measures, the study of the speech spectrograms, as well as subjective listening tests, confirm that the enhanced speech is more pleasant to a human listener. Finally, the proposed enhancement algorithm is tested as a front-end processor for speech recognition in noise, resulting in improved results over classical subtractive-type algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748118/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6188159","volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Single channel speech enhancement based on masking properties of the human auditory system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single channel speech enhancement based on masking properties of the human auditory system","sourcePdf":"00748118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090627S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"379","articleId":"748118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":748120,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.F.

Typically, 30-70% of the computational time of a continuous density hidden Markov model-based (HMM-based) speech recognizer is spent calculating probabilities. The aim of CS is to reduce this load by selecting the subset of Gaussian component likelihoods that should be computed given a particular input vector. This paper examines new techniques for obtaining \"good\" Gaussian subsets or \"shortlists.\" All the new schemes make use of state information, specifically, to which state each of the Gaussian components belongs. In this way, a maximum number of Gaussian components per state may be specified, hence reducing the size of the shortlist. The first technique introduced is a simple extension of the standard GS method, which uses this state information. Then, more complex schemes based on maximizing the likelihood of the training data are proposed. These new approaches are compared with the standard GS scheme on a large vocabulary speech recognition task. On this task, the use of state information reduced the percentage of Gaussians computed to 10-15%, compared with 20-30% for the standard GS scheme, with little degradation in performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748120/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6188161","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"State-based Gaussian selection in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition using HMMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State-based Gaussian selection in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition using HMMs","sourcePdf":"00748120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06105S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"31","articleId":"748120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":748135,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The method does not require an artificial line-impedance stabilizing network (LISN) but does, however, allow the emission levels to be calculated as if an LISN were present. Testing can be performed when an LISN is either unavailable, prohibitively expensive, or impractical to include in the supply. This is often the case for large drive systems or for systems already installed in the field. A normal RF voltage probe and a spectrum analyzer are used to measure the spectra of the common-mode and differential-mode excitation sources due to the inverter switching. Line inductors for high-frequency (HF) isolation are required for some of the tests, but the cost and complexity of these compared to an LISN is low. Common-mode and differential-mode Thevenin equivalent circuits are then derived from measured impedances. The emissions for any defined supply impedance (including an LISN) can then be determined. A laboratory test on a 15 kW PWM drive system is carried out to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/15.748137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel4/15/16150/00748137.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.748137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of conducted electromagnetic emissions in PWM motor drive systems without the need for an LISN","volume":"41","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6192104","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748137/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of conducted electromagnetic emissions in PWM motor drive systems without the need for an LISN","sourcePdf":"00748137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026276S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"33","articleId":"748137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":748146,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Ill Moon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National Polytechnic University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ill Moon","id":"37087355535"},{"name":"A.

The direct state feedback is then replaced with nonlinear observers to estimate the vehicle velocity from the output of the system (i.e., wheel velocity).

Because of the finite amount of hardware resources, the problem is to use a \"right\" amount of hardware in a specific configuration so to maximize the processing speed. In this paper, the problem of finding the right processor array configuration is formulated as a constrained optimization problem where the cost function includes not only the cost of individual processor arrays but also the cost of interfacing circuits. Three heuristic algorithms are presented for the optimization problem. Among them, both the Lth axial neighbor algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm produce good results on a test case. Simulation results on the test case also indicate that the initial configuration is important in getting a good configuration for both algorithms. The Lth axial neighbor algorithm has the extra advantage of requiring less amount of performance tuning.","doi":"10.1109/43.748156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/16153/00748156.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.748156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processor array design with FPGA area constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748156/","displayDocTitle":"Processor array design with FPGA area constraint","volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6196917","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processor array design with FPGA area constraint","sourcePdf":"00748156.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107366S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","articleId":"748156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":748162,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The method utilizes the register-transfer level (RTL) circuit description of an ASPP or ASIP to come up with a set of test microcode patterns which can be written into the instruction read-only memory (ROM) of the processor. These lines of microcode dictate a new control/data flow in the circuit and can be used to test modules which are not easily testable. The new control/data flow is used to justify precomputed test sets of a module from the system primary inputs to the module inputs and propagate output responses from the module output to the system primary outputs. The testability analysis, which is based on the relevant control/data flow extracted from the RTL circuit, is symbolic. Thus, it is independent of the bit-width of the data path and is extremely fast. The test microcode patterns are a by-product of this analysis. If the derived test microcode cannot test all untested modules in the circuit, then test multiplexers are added (usually to the off-critical paths of the data path) to test these modules. This is done to guarantee the testability of all modules in the circuit. If the control microcode memory of the processor is erasable, then the test microcode lines can be erased once the testing of the chip is over. In that case, the DFT scheme has very little overhead (typically less than 1%). Otherwise, the test microcode lines remain as an overhead in the control memory. The method requires the addition of only one external test pin. Application of this technique to several examples has resulted in a very high fault coverage (above 99.6%) for all of them. The test generation time is about three orders of magnitude smaller compared to an efficient gate-level sequential test generator. The average area overhead (without assuming an erasable ROM) is 3.1% while the delay overheads are negligible. This method does not require any scan in the controller or data path. It is also amenable to at-speed testing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical test generation and design for testability methods for ASPPs and ASIPs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.748165","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/16153/00748165.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.748165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748165/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical test generation and design for testability methods for ASPPs and ASIPs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6196926","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical test generation and design for testability methods for ASPPs and ASIPs","sourcePdf":"00748165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082293S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"28","articleId":"748165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":748169,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongnam Youn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Processing Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Jeongnam Youn","id":"37373751500"},{"name":"Ming-Ting Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Processing Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Ming-Ting Sun","id":"37278328800"},{"name":"Chia-Wen Lin","affiliation":["Computer and Communication Research Laboratories, ITRI, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Wen Lin","id":"37278408000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-9210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0077"}],"articleNumber":"748169","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":171,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":447},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits &amp; Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"In transcoding, simply reusing the motion vectors extracted from an incoming video bit stream may not result in the best quality.

Those shadows are generated by objects moving between a light source and the background. Moving cast shadows cause a frame difference between two succeeding images of a monocular video image sequence. For shadow detection, these frame differences are detected and classified into regions covered and regions uncovered by a moving shadow. The detection and classification assume plane background and a nonnegligible size and intensity of the light sources. A cast shadow is detected by temporal integration of the covered background regions while subtracting the uncovered background regions. The shadow detection method is integrated into an algorithm for two-dimensional (2-D) shape estimation of moving objects from the informative part of the description of the international standard ISO/MPEG-4. The extended segmentation algorithm compensates first apparent camera motion. Then, a spatially adaptive relaxation scheme estimates a change detection mask for two consecutive images. An object mask is derived from the change detection mask by elimination of changes due to background uncovered by moving objects and by elimination of changes due to background covered or uncovered by moving cast shadows. Results obtained with MPEG-4 test sequences and additional sequences show that the accuracy of object segmentation is substantially improved in presence of moving cast shadows. Objects and shadows are detected and tracked separately.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel4/6046/16151/00748172.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"76","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/6046.748172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6046.748172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of moving cast shadows for object segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Object segmentation","Light sources","Change detection algorithms","ISO standards","MPEG 4 Standard","Layout","Image sequences","Two dimensional displays","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","motion estimation","standards","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving cast shadows detection","object segmentation","dominating scene background","monocular video image sequence","temporal integration","shape estimation","ISO/MPEG-4"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Detection of moving cast shadows for object segmentation","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6184725","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of moving cast shadows for object segmentation","sourcePdf":"00748172.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050181S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"214","articleId":"748172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":748173,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

We propose to transmit source data layers of different perceptual importance in parallel, each occupying a number of subchannels. New loading algorithms are developed to efficiently allocate the available resources, e.g., transmitted power and bit rate, to the subchannels according to the source layers they transmit. Instead of making the bit error rate of all the subchannels equal as in most existing loading algorithms, the proposed algorithm assigns different error performance to the subchannels to achieve unequal error protection for different layers. The channel induced distortion in mean-square sense is minimized. We show that the proposed system can be applied nicely to both fixed length coding and variable-length coding. Asymptotic gains with respect to channel distortion are also derived. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance improvement compared to the existing work, especially for spectrally shaped channels commonly used in in ADSL systems.","doi":"10.1109/6046.748174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel4/6046/16151/00748174.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6046.748174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16151","startPage":"88","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust image and video transmission over spectrally shaped channels using multicarrier modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust image and video transmission over spectrally shaped channels using multicarrier modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748174/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6184727","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust image and video transmission over spectrally shaped channels using multicarrier modulation","sourcePdf":"00748174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061737S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"43","articleId":"748174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":748175,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We present a system that adapts multimedia Web documents to optimally match the capabilities of the client device requesting it. This system has two key components. 1) A representation scheme called the InfoPyramid that provides a multimodal, multiresolution representation hierarchy for multimedia. 2) A customizer that selects the best content representation to meet the client capabilities while delivering the most value. We model the selection process as a resource allocation problem in a generalized rate distortion framework. In this framework, we address the issue of both multiple media types in a Web document and multiple resource types at the client. We extend this framework to allow prioritization on the content items in a Web document. We illustrate our content adaptation technique with a web server that adapts multimedia news stories to clients as diverse as workstations, PDA's and cellular phones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6184728","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adapting multimedia Internet content for universal access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adapting multimedia Internet content for universal access","sourcePdf":"00748175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070476S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"297","articleId":"748175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":748177,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The ADC is ideally suited to pixel-level implementation in a CMOS image sensor. The ADC uses successive comparisons to output one bit at a time simultaneously from all pixels.

The comparator/latch pair operates at very slow speeds and can be implemented using simple robust circuits. The ADCs can be fully tested by applying electrical signals without any optics or light sources. A CMOS 320/spl times/256 sensor using the MCBS ADC is described. The chip measures 4.14/spl times/5.16 mm/sup 2/. It achieves 10/spl times/10 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ pixel size at 28% fill factor in 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. Each 2/spl times/2 pixel block shares an ADC. The pixel block circuit comprises 18 transistors. It operates in subthreshold to maximize gain and minimize power consumption. The power consumed by the sensor array is 20 mW at 30 frames/s. The measured integral nonlinearity is 2.3 LSB, and differential nonlinearity is 1.2 LSB at eight bits of resolution.

In this paper, we use the dual-threshold technique to reduce leakage power by assigning a high-threshold voltage to some transistors in noncritical paths, and using low-threshold transistors in critical path(s). In order to achieve the best leakage power saving under target performance constraints, an algorithm is presented for selecting and assigning an optimal high-threshold voltage. A general leakage current model which has been verified by HSPICE simulations is used to estimate leakage power. Results show that the dual-threshold technique is good for leakage power reduction during both standby and active modes. For some ISCAS benchmark circuits, the leakage power can be reduced by more than 80%. The total active power saving can be around 50% and 20% at low- and high-switching activities, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748196/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6200546","volume":"7","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and optimization of dual-threshold circuits for low-voltage low-power applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and optimization of dual-threshold circuits for low-voltage low-power applications","sourcePdf":"00748196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048696S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"185","articleId":"748196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":748197,"authors":[{"name":"J.Y.

The power consumed by the bus can, therefore, be substantially reduced. The basic idea of bus segmentation is to partition the bus into several bus segments separated by pass transistors. Highly communicating devices are located to adjacent bus segments, thus, most data communication can be achieved by switching a small portion of the bus segments. As a result, power consumption and critical path delay are both reduced. Experimental results obtained by simulating a delay model and a power model demonstrate that the proposed segmented bus system reduces bus power by about 60%-70% and improves critical bus delay by about 10%-30%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/16156/00748197.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"29","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/92.748197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.748197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmented bus design for low-power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system modeling","Energy consumption","Tree graphs","Data communication","Delay","Very large scale integration","Communication switching","Capacitance","Wires","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power electronics","capacitance","delays","VLSI","integrated circuit modelling","driver circuits","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["segmented bus design","low-power systems","switched capacitance","pass transistors","power consumption","critical path delay","delay model","bus power","critical bus delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Segmented bus design for low-power systems","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6200547","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmented bus design for low-power systems","sourcePdf":"00748197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045582S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"56","articleId":"748197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":748201,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The proposed architecture is dedicated to flexible block-oriented image processing, such as adaptive vector quantization used in wavelet image coding. We show that reading the image along a two-dimensional (2-D) pseudo-fractal scan creates a very modular and regular data flow and, therefore, considerably reduces the folding complexity and memory requirements for VLSI implementation. This leads to significant area savings for on-chip storage (up to a factor of two) and reduces the power consumption. Furthermore, data scheduling and memory management remain very simple. The end result is an efficient VLSI implementation with a reduced area cost compared to the conventional approaches, reading the input data line by line.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/16156/00748201.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient VLSI architecture for 2-D wavelet image coding with novel image scan","doi":"10.1109/92.748201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.748201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748201/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"An efficient VLSI architecture for 2-D wavelet image coding with novel image scan","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6200551","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient VLSI architecture for 2-D wavelet image coding with novel image scan","sourcePdf":"00748201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05275S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"25","articleId":"748201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":748202,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In the multilevel paradigm, a sequence of successively coarser hypergraphs is constructed. A bisection of the smallest hypergraph is computed and it is used to obtain a bisection of the original hypergraph by successively projecting and refining the bisection to the next level finer hypergraph. We have developed new hypergraph coarsening strategies within the multilevel framework. We evaluate their performance both in terms of the size of the hyperedge cut on the bisection, as well as on the run time for a number of very large scale integration circuits. Our experiments show that our multilevel hypergraph-partitioning algorithm produces high-quality partitioning in a relatively small amount of time. The quality of the partitionings produced by our scheme are on the average 6%-23% better than those produced by other state-of-the-art schemes. Furthermore, our partitioning algorithm is significantly faster, often requiring 4-10 times less time than that required by the other schemes. Our multilevel hypergraph-partitioning algorithm scales very well for large hypergraphs. Hypergraphs with over 100 000 vertices can be bisected in a few minutes on today's workstations. Also, on the large hypergraphs, our scheme outperforms other schemes (in hyperedge cut) quite consistently with larger margins (9%-30%).","doi":"10.1109/92.748202","startPage":"69","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.748202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16156","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/16156/00748202.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel hypergraph partitioning: applications in VLSI domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748202/","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel hypergraph partitioning: applications in VLSI domain","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6200552","publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel hypergraph partitioning: applications in VLSI domain","sourcePdf":"00748202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040037S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"368","articleId":"748202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":748203,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.E.

These larger circuits often require significant amounts of storage. In order to address these storage requirements, FPGAs with large embedded memory arrays are now being developed by several vendors. One of the crucial components of an FPGA with on-chip memory is the routing structure between the memory arrays and logic resources. If this memory/logic interface is not flexible enough, many circuits will be unroutable, while if it is too flexible, it will be slower and consume more chip area than is necessary. In this paper, we show that an interconnect in which each memory pin can connect to between four and seven logic routing tracks is best in terms of both area and speed. We also show that by adding switches to support nets that connect multiple memory arrays, we can reduce the memory access time by up to 25% and improve the routability slightly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6200553","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"7","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"The memory/logic interface in FPGAs with large embedded memory arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The memory/logic interface in FPGAs with large embedded memory arrays","sourcePdf":"00748203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052003S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"19","articleId":"748203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":748204,"authors":[{"name":"B.P.

Embedded systems are generally specified in terms of a set of acyclic task graphs. In this paper, we present a co-synthesis algorithm COSYN, which starts with periodic task graphs with real-time constraints and produces a low-cost heterogeneous distributed embedded-system architecture meeting these constraints. It supports both concurrent and sequential modes of communication and computation. It employs a combination of preemptive and nonpreemptive static scheduling. It allows task graphs in which different tasks have different deadlines. It introduces the concept of an association array to tackle the problem of multirate systems. It uses a new task-clustering technique, which takes the changing nature of the critical path in the task graph into account. It supports pipelining of task graphs and a mix of various technologies to meet embedded-system constraints and minimize power dissipation. In general, embedded-system tasks are reused across multiple functions. COSYN uses the concept of architectural hints and reuse to exploit this fact. Finally, if desired, it also optimizes the architecture for power consumption. COSYN produces optimal results for the examples from the literature while providing several orders of magnitude advantage in central processing unit time over an existing optimal algorithm.

Array architecture is a popular technique to implement these multipliers due to its regular compact structure. High power dissipation in these structures is mainly due to the switching of a large number of gates during multiplication. In addition, much power is also dissipated due to a large number of spurious transitions on internal nodes. Timing analysis of a full adder, which is a basic building block in array multipliers, has resulted in a different array connection pattern that reduces power dissipation due to the spurious transition activity. Furthermore, this connection pattern also improves the multiplier throughput. This array pattern is based on creating a compact tiled structure, wherein the shape of a tile represents the delay through that tile. That is, a compact structure created using these tiles is nothing but a structure with high throughput. Such a temporal tiling technique can also be applied to other digital circuits. Based on our simulation studies, a temporally tiled array multiplier achieves 50% and 35% improvements in delay and power dissipation compared to a conventional array multiplier. Improvement in delay can be traded for power using voltage reduction techniques.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.748208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16156","startPage":"121","endPage":"124","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/16156/00748208.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance low power array multiplier using temporal tiling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"High performance low power array multiplier using temporal tiling","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6200558","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance low power array multiplier using temporal tiling","sourcePdf":"00748208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026035S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"47","articleId":"748208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":748211,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A single arrayed-waveguide router is simultaneously used for multiplexing and demultiplexing. This results in crosstalk not only from the incoming channels, but from the outgoing channels as well. We show that the performance of the OADM degrades as either N or m are increased, suggesting that the number of channels in a network based on OADM's is limited by crosstalk in the AWG router. When an optical filter is added at the output of the OADM the digital signal-to-noise ratio Q is independent of N and m, and within a few tenths of a decibel of the perfect filtering case.","doi":"10.1109/68.748231","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","startPage":"349","endPage":"351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/68/16158/00748231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.748231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of crosstalk in an arrayed-waveguide router on an optical add-drop multiplexer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical arrays","Optical crosstalk","Optical add-drop multiplexers","Optical filters","Optical fiber networks","Degradation","Optical noise","Signal to noise ratio","Demultiplexing","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical crosstalk","multiplexing equipment","wavelength division multiplexing","demultiplexing","optical noise","optical planar waveguides","optical waveguide filters","telecommunication network routing","optical fibre networks","optical communication equipment","optical arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","arrayed-waveguide router","optical add-drop multiplexer","crosstalk impact","performance","N-channel optical add-drop multiplexer","add/drop channels","n-pass channels","single arrayed-waveguide router","multiplexing","demultiplexing","incoming channels","outgoing channels","network","AWG router","optical filter","digital signal-to-noise ratio","perfect filtering case"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Impact of crosstalk in an arrayed-waveguide router on an optical add-drop multiplexer","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6186509","publicationDate":"March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748231/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of crosstalk in an arrayed-waveguide router on an optical add-drop multiplexer","sourcePdf":"00748231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037592S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"8","articleId":"748231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":748232,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

This problem is treated in the context of detecting a constant signal in additive, independent and identically distributed noise. Detectors that base their decisions on the comparison with a threshold of accumulated, nonlinearly transformed observations are treated. Asymptotic expressions are derived for the relationship between sample size and error probabilities for this model in two situations: that in which the nonlinearity has a partially absolutely continuous output distribution; and that in which it has a lattice output distribution. Traditional analyses of such problems have involved only the lowest-order terms of such relationships (i.e., central limit results), leading to performance indices such as the Pitman asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE). Such indices are known to be of limited accuracy in predicting performance for more moderate sample sizes. Here, the behavior of sample size as a function of error probabilities is considered in more detail, leading to more accurate indices of relative efficiencies for such detection problems. Several specific examples are examined in detail, and numerical results are included to illustrate the significantly improved performance estimation afforded thereby for even small sample sizes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1993.748330","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00748330.png","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Improvements in the performance of a concatenated coding system that uses VA decoding (inner decoder) can be obtained when, in addition to the stanard output, an indicator of the reliability of the VA decision is delivered to the outer stage of processing. Two different approaches of extending the VA are considered. In the first approach, the VA is extended with a Soft Output unit (SOVA) that calculates, based on the difference between the cumulative metrics of the two paths merging at each time instant and state, reliability values for each of the decoded information symbols. In the second approach, coding gains are obtained by delivering, in addition to the best path, the next L - 1 best estimates of the transmitted data sequence. Here, the output format is a list of size L. This is a List VA (LVA). In this work, we evaluate LVA and SOVA in comparison to each other and attain extended versions of LVA and SOVA with low complexity that implement the other algorithm. We construct and evaluate a List-SOVA using the reliability information of the SOVA to generate a list of size L and that also has a lower complexity than the LVA for a long list size. Further, we introduce a low complexity algorithm that accepts the list output of the LVA and calculates for each of the decoded information bits a reliability value. The complexity and the performance of this Soft-LVA is a function of the list size L. The performances of Soft-LVA and SOVA are compared in concatenated coding systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1993.748337","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00748337.png","startPage":"22","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The quick simulation technique developed extends to avalanche photodetection and is also compatible with a wide variety of coding schemes.

It is assumed that the receiver has no knowledge of the signature waveforms or timing information of other users. The receiver is trained by a known training sequence prior to data transmission, and continuously adjusted by an adaptive algorithm during data transmission. An adaptive, fractionally spaced least mean square (LMS) filter is employed for each user separately, instead of matched filters with constant coefficients. The proposed receiver is as simple as a standard single user detector receiver but it achieves essential advantages with respect to timing recovery, multiple-access interference elimination, narrowband interference suppression and user privacy. In comparison to the centralized linear multi-user detectior it has the same bit error performance while the computation complexity is substantially lower and independent of the number of users. The receiver structure is investigated and tested by simulation using a set of Gold sequences of length 31.

We discuss a linear equalizer as well as a reduced-state-sequence estimation (RSSE) scheme for CDMA channels with intersymbol interference. The linear equalizer is a modification of the decorrelating detector proposed by Lupas and Verdu. The RSSE collapses 2/sup K/ states into 2 states where K is the number of users. Both techniques are superior to a traditional matched filter detector (RAKE) when the interuser interference and/or the intersymbol interference is relatively strong. In a severe near-far environment, the RSSE can show significant (2 -3 dB) improvement over the linear equalizer in terms of receiver signal-to-noise ratio.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1993.748362","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The MMSE detector is near-far resistant, and can be implemented adaptively when no explicit knowledge of the interferers' signature sequences is available. We assume that users are assigned random binary signature sequences and derive upper and lower bounds on the average near far resistance of the MMSE detector. For synchronous CDMA, the MMSE detector considered has the same near-far resistance as the maximum likelihood and decorrelating detectors, so that the bounds derived apply to these detectors as well.

Thus, the asymptotic multiuser efficiency is an attenuation of the error rate exponent for isolated transmission and maximum a posteriori demodulation, and provides a simple yet precise means of comparing multiuser receivers for sufficiently low noise levels. To date, this parameter is only known for the following receivers in the 2-user, asynchronous AWGN channel: the maximum likelihood sequence detector, the decorrelating detector, the linear MMSE detector, and the conventional detector. In this talk the asymptotic multiuser efficiencies for a class of detectors for the 2-user, asynchronous AWGN channel will be presented. This class may be loosely described as receivers which estimate and subtract multiple-access interference (MAI) by using tentative data decisions, and includes the two stage detectors with both conventional or decorrelated tentative decisions. The asymptotic multiuser efficiencies for this class of detectors clearly indicate regions for which a given user should avoid updating tentative decisions and suggest combinations of the above receivers to improve single-user performance. This technique applies to the AME of soft tentative decision strategies as well, and we demonstrate that the near-far resistance of two-stage detectors may be markedly improved using soft decision nonlinearities. Below we present an outline of the approach for conventional tentative decisions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1993.748365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14996","startPage":"50","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

In this talk we present cosets for which d/sup 2//sub free/ is larger than the free Hamming distance of any convolutional code with the same rate and constraint length. We also describe how the new bounds, described in [1, 2], on the maximum zero-run length of cosets may be used to ensure a short zero-run length at the channel output. Analytical arguments, supported by results from computer search, suggest that cosets with large free squared euclidean distance also have short maximum zerorun lengths.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1993.748556","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Block interleaved RM codewords are transmitted with preceding over the PRIV channel. In the receiver, soft-decision decoding is accomplished in two stages. An inner decoder accounts for the preceded transmission of binary symbols over the PRIV channel. Approximate log-likelihood ratios for individual code symbols are determined by a new bi-directional symbol estimation algorithm. The obtained soft information values are deinterleaved and passed to the outer decoding stage. With sufficient interleaving, these values represent the appropriate metrics for soft-decision RM decoding. An efficient suboptimal decoding algorithm based on the generalized multiple concatenation (GMC) structure of RM codes is employed. Real coding gains over uncoded transmission with maximum-likelihood sequence decoding were determined by simulation. Results are presented for various RM code parameters and degrees of interleaving. Encoder and decoder realization as well as complexity issues are addressed. A comparison with other coding schemes known for PRIV channels shows significant advantages of the scheme considered here in terms of coding gains versus decoding complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1993.748557","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Our multiuser channel model incorporates the effects of propagation, frequency selective fading, and interference among users in the presence of a constrained system bandwidth. The CDMA and FH systems are compared using BPSK modulation. The main point of contrast between these systems is that the orthogonal hopping patterns in a FH system result in a decreased additive interference power, however the frequency spreading nature of CDMA results in the ability to combat fading. An information theoretic analysis is presented, which shows that system capacity is larger for CDMA than for FH. Hence, for this channel, with sufficient coding the CDMA system can achieve a higher level of performance than the FH system. However, it is unclear what level of complexity would be required to achieve such performance, and what effect such complexity would have on the practicality of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1993.748566","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

An analysis method concerning the probability of the first error event at large SNR is developed for the whole SA(B,C) family and results in an analysis tool named the Vector Euclidean Distance (VED) of which the traditional Euclidean Distance (ED) is a scalar special case.

An isomorphism between a. trellis constructed using Massey's method and one constructed using Wolf's method is derived. It is confirmed that Wolf's and Massey's trellis constructions also yield minimal trellises. Two simplified methods for minimal trellis construction ate presented, along with a. method to calculate the trellis dimensions that is art alternative to the methods of [2] and [3]. An improvement is found to a lower bound on the maximum trellis dimension due to Muder [4]. It is shown that when equivalent codes are constructed by permutations of the symbol positions the resulting trellis dimensions are fixed near either end, while in the central portion of the trellis the dimensions vary between an attainable upper bound and a lower bound. From the lower bound on the trellis dimensions in the central portion of the trellis it is seen that only codes (and their duals) that meet a certain condition on their minimum distances can possibly have a trellis with a relatively small number of states.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00748605.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

At the moment, the main question about interference-resilient receivers is: do they really bring forth the capacity increase they promise on theoretical grounds? The aim of this study is to give a preliminary answer to such a question, through the capacity analysis of the forward link of a multisatellite, multibeam, radio communication network. Specifically, starting from simplified yet realistic assumptions on the beam layout, the antenna footprint shape, and the coding/multiplexing/modulation and power control strategies, it is shown that the blind, adaptive, interference-mitigation receiver, selected as an appealing representative of the lot, can indeed boost the system quality of service in terms of outage probability. The results are derived after a mix of theoretical analysis (as far as the detector performance evaluation is concerned) and simulation (to examine a number of different random system configurations) to circumvent the inherent complexity of the issue.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16164/00748784.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.748784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.748784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16164","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of a multibeam, multisatellite CDMA mobile radio network with interference-mitigating receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio","Receivers","Multiple access interference","Radio network","Radio communication","Adaptive arrays","Receiving antennas","Shape control","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","mobile satellite communication","land mobile radio","radio receivers","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","quality of service","telecommunication network reliability","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibeam multisatellite CDMA mobile radio network","interference-mitigating algorithms","capacity","code-division multiple-access","forward link","beam layout","antenna footprint shape","coding","multiplexing","modulation","power control","blind adaptive interference-mitigation receiver","quality of service","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of a multibeam, multisatellite CDMA mobile radio network with interference-mitigating receivers","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6191191","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of a multibeam, multisatellite CDMA mobile radio network with interference-mitigating receivers","sourcePdf":"00748784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043861S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"7","articleId":"748784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":748786,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

Our results show that differential M-ary orthogonal signaling presents very good performance at Doppler frequency shifts much higher than the symbol rate. Amplitude statistics are considered to be Rayleigh, but may be easily extended to more general models based on the analytical derivation presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16164/00748786.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.748786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.748786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16164","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential M-ary orthogonal signaling for DS/CDMA land mobile satellite communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Satellite communication","Rayleigh channels","Least squares approximation","Doppler shift","Power system modeling","Performance analysis","Decoding","Frequency","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler shift","code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","Walsh functions","telecommunication signalling","land mobile radio","mobile satellite communication","Rayleigh channels","decoding","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential M-ary orthogonal signaling","DS/CDMA land mobile satellite communications","performance","differential decoding","Walsh chips","Hadamard chips","nonpilot-assisted detection","fast fading environments","land mobile satellite channel","LMS channel","Doppler frequency shifts","amplitude statistics","Rayleigh statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Differential M-ary orthogonal signaling for DS/CDMA land mobile satellite communications","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6191192","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential M-ary orthogonal signaling for DS/CDMA land mobile satellite communications","sourcePdf":"00748786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050995S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1","articleId":"748786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":748788,"authors":[{"name":"C.G.F.

In this paper, the method referred to as the fast convolution filter bank is analyzed for regenerative payloads. The size of the input fast Fourier transform (FFT) depends on the narrowest channel, while the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) number of points is relative to the decimation ratio associated with each channel. In order to reduce the complexity, most of the frequency coefficients are forced to zero, leading to a violation of the overlap-and-save (OS) condition. It is shown that the resulting error can be modeled as a cyclostationary process, and an optimization method based on minimization of the associated mean-square error (MSE) is proposed. Fast convolution is then compared with multistage implementation in terms of flexibility, reconfigurability, and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/49.748789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16164/00748789.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.748789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast convolution filter banks for satellite payloads with on-board processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748789/","displayDocTitle":"Fast convolution filter banks for satellite payloads with on-board processing","volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6191194","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast convolution filter banks for satellite payloads with on-board processing","sourcePdf":"00748789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038689S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"32","articleId":"748789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":748798,"authors":[{"name":"A.

With the March C algorithm, the BIST circuit's overhead is under 1.3% for a 1-Mbit DRAM and under 0.3% for a 16-Mbit DRAM. The BIST design presented for embedded DRAM supports built-in self-diagnosis by feeding error information to the external tester. Moreover, using a specific test sequence, it can test for critical timing faults, reducing tester time for ac parametric test. The design supports wafer test, pre-burn-in test, burn-in, and final test. It is field-programmable; the user can program test algorithms using predetermined test elements (such as march elements, surround test elements, and refresh modes). The user can optimize the hardware for a specific embedded DRAM with a set of predetermined test elements. Our design is different from the microprogram-controlled BIST described by J. Dreibelbis et al. (1998) which has greater flexibility but higher overhead.

SS/CDMA provides both multiple access and switching to a geostationary multibeam satellite. Multiple access is resolved by space, frequency, and code division. Space division is introduced by the multibeam antennas that provide frequency reuse in each beam. The spectrum is then channelized into frequency bands where each band is accessed by code division for both the uplink and downlink. The satellite on-board performs the switching function, which is also based on compatible code-multiplexed switching. The switch may route both circuit calls and data packets which are assigned upon request. The on-board code-division switch operates under the control of a channel assignment algorithm. We provide channel assignment algorithms for optimum, suboptimum, and random switch operation. The system throughput has been evaluated for each case and compared. Performance analysis has been carried out for the case of the optimum switch scheduling. The analysis is based on a discrete-time Markovian model, and provides the call-blocking probabilities and data packet delays. Computer simulations have been used to evaluate the performance of the optimum, suboptimum, and random cases. It is shown that the circuit call-blocking probabilities achieved for these cases are almost the same. The optimum algorithm achieves the minimum data packet delay, while the performance of the suboptimum algorithm is slightly better than the random one. Furthermore, data packets may be routed via the switch with limited delays, even with a heavy load of circuit calls.","doi":"10.1109/49.748812","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16164/00748812.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.748812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput evaluation of a satellite-switched CDMA (SS/CDMA) demand assignment system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748812/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput evaluation of a satellite-switched CDMA (SS/CDMA) demand assignment system","volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6197596","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput evaluation of a satellite-switched CDMA (SS/CDMA) demand assignment system","sourcePdf":"00748812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034871S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"13","articleId":"748812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":748815,"authors":[{"name":"T.R.

We first summarize the various ways in which latency and asymmetry can impair the performance of the Internet's transmission control protocol (TCP), and discuss extensions to standard TCP that alleviate some of these performance problems. Through analysis, simulation, and experiments, we quantify the performance of state-of-the-art TCP implementations in a satellite environment. A key part of the experimental method is the use of traffic models empirically derived from Internet traffic traces. We identify those TCP implementations that can be expected to perform reasonably well, and those that can suffer serious performance degradation. An important result is that, even with the best satellite-optimized TCP implementations, moderate levels of congestion in the wide-area Internet can seriously degrade performance for satellite connections. For scenarios in which TCP performance is poor, we investigate the potential improvement of using a satellite gateway, proxy, or Web cache to \"split\" transport connections in a manner transparent to end users. Finally, we describe a new transport protocol for use internally within a satellite network or as part of a split connection. This protocol, which we call the satellite transport protocol (STP), is optimized for challenging network impairments such as high latency, asymmetry, and high error rates. Among its chief benefits are up to an order of magnitude reduction in the bandwidth used in the reverse path, as compared to standard TCP, when conducting large file transfers. This is a particularly important attribute for the kind of asymmetric connectivity likely to dominate satellite-based Internet access.","doi":"10.1109/49.748815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16164","startPage":"326","endPage":"344","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16164/00748815.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.748815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transport protocols for Internet-compatible satellite networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transport protocols","IP networks","Internet","Low earth orbit satellites","Delay","Traffic control","Degradation","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","transport protocols","satellite communication","performance evaluation","telecommunication traffic","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet-compatible satellite networks","geostationary orbit","GEO","low-altitude Earth orbit","LEO","congestion","latency","asymmetry","performance","transmission control protocol","TCP","simulation","experiments","traffic models","Internet traffic traces","satellite gateway","proxy","Web cache","satellite transport protocol","split connection","network impairments","high error rates","bandwidth","file transfer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Transport protocols for Internet-compatible satellite networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6191199","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transport protocols for Internet-compatible satellite networks","sourcePdf":"00748815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045034S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"171","articleId":"748815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":748816,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Communication over satellite links is often characterized by sporadic high bit-error rates and burst losses. This is especially true when working in the Ka band, where weather conditions greatly affect link availability. Under such conditions, the TCP protocol that is predominantly used by data applications degrades dramatically in performance. Using simulations, this paper studies the performance of TCP under different network conditions. Several modifications, that take advantage of the special properties of the satellite channel, are proposed, and a new sender algorithm which can efficiently handle burst losses is presented. The main attractiveness of the proposed new sender algorithm is that it can be implemented only at the satellite ground station, rather than at every server in the world.","doi":"10.1109/49.748816","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"345","endPage":"359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16164/00748816.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.748816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed Internet access through unidirectional geostationary satellite channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modems","Throughput","Internet telephony","Satellite ground stations","Web server","Network servers","Propagation delay","Artificial satellites","Bit error rate","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","direct broadcasting by satellite","telecommunication channels","transport protocols","performance evaluation","satellite links","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed Internet access","unidirectional geostationary satellite channels","satellite links","high bit-error rates","burst losses","Ka band","weather conditions","link availability","TCP protocol","data applications","simulations","network conditions","sender algorithm","satellite ground station","direct satellite channel","home user"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"High-speed Internet access through unidirectional geostationary satellite channels","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6191200","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748816/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed Internet access through unidirectional geostationary satellite channels","sourcePdf":"00748816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033427S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","articleId":"748816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":748832,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The device may eventually show improved modulation bandwidth over conventional vertical injection lasers with bulk contacts, since its geometry and the 2-D nature of the injection offer reduced capacitance, HEMT integration, and an elimination of carrier capture problems.","doi":"10.1109/3.748840","startPage":"352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3/16163/00748840.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.748840","endPage":"357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The two-dimensional lateral injection in-plane laser","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"The two-dimensional lateral injection in-plane laser","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6198689","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The two-dimensional lateral injection in-plane laser","sourcePdf":"00748840.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047343S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"20","articleId":"748840","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":748848,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A low order all-pass filter can equalize the feedforward path so that it approximately achieves a minimum phase response. In this paper, we describe an adaptive algorithm for iteratively determining the optimal transfer function of the all-pass filter. Adaptation is based on estimating the gradient of the mean-square error with respect to the poles of the filter. This estimate is then used to update the positions of the poles. One simplifying feature of this technique is that these gradients are determined by applying the output of the all-pass to low-order finite impulse response (FIR) filters. We do not require values from the internal states of the filter. The proposed adaptation algorithm is characterized for first- and second-order all-pass filters over a range of storage densities. The optimality of the resulting equalizer is evaluated as a function of the order of the FLR filters used in estimating the gradients.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6198676","volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptation of an all-pass equalizer for decision feedback equalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptation of an all-pass equalizer for decision feedback equalization","sourcePdf":"00748857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044524S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"5","articleId":"748857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":748864,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper compares the dc-measured reverse-breakdown characteristics of low-voltage (<250 V) small-area (<5/spl times/10/sup -4/ cm/sup 2/) 4H-SiC p/sup +/-n diodes with and without elementary screw dislocations. Diodes containing elementary screw dislocations exhibited higher pre-breakdown reverse leakage currents, softer reverse breakdown current-voltage (I-V) knees, and highly localized microplasmic breakdown current filaments compared to screw dislocation-free devices. The observed localized 4H-SiC breakdown parallels microplasmic breakdown observed in silicon and other semiconductors, in which space-charge effects limit current conduction through the local microplasma as reverse bias is increased.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of bulk and elementary screw dislocation assisted reverse breakdown in low-voltage (<250 V) 4H-SiC p/sup +/-n junction diodes.

The method works by tessellating the input image into small square blocks with only one phase wrap. These blocks are unwrapped using a simple procedure, and the unwrapped blocks are merged together using one of two proposed block merging algorithms. By specifying a suitable mask, the method can easily handle objects of any shape. This approach is compared with the Ghiglia-Romero (1994) method and the Marroquin-Rivera (1995) method. On synthetic images with different noise levels, the BLS method is shown to be superior, both with respect to the resulting gray values in the unwrapped image as well as visual inspection. The method is also shown to successfully unwrap synthetic and real images with shears, fiber-optic interferometry images, and medical magnetic resonance images. We believe the new method has the potential to improve the present quality of phase unwrapped images of several different image modalities.","doi":"10.1109/83.748892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/16166/00748892.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.748892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional phase unwrapping using a block least-squares method","volume":"8","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6193888","pubMedId":"18262880","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748892/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional phase unwrapping using a block least-squares method","sourcePdf":"00748892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074832S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"56","articleId":"748892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":748893,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The least-squares optimum approach involves the computation of the three-dimensional (3-D) Fourier transform of the sequence, followed by the detection of one or more planes in this domain with high energy concentration. We present a more efficient algorithm, based on the properties of the Radon transform and the two-dimensional (2-D) fast Fourier transform, which can sacrifice little performance for significant computational savings. We accomplish the motion detection and estimation by designing appropriate matched filters. The performance is demonstrated on two image sequences.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748900/","volume":"8","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6193896","pubMedId":"18262888","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional matched filtering for motion estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional matched filtering for motion estimation","sourcePdf":"00748900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062192S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"26","articleId":"748900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":748907,"authors":[{"name":"J.I.

Given the importance of object-oriented development techniques, one specific area where this has occurred is coupling measurement in object-oriented systems. However, despite a very interesting and rich body of work, there is little understanding of the motivation and empirical hypotheses behind many of these new measures. It is often difficult to determine how such measures relate to one another and for which application they can be used. As a consequence, it is very difficult for practitioners and researchers to obtain a clear picture of the state of the art in order to select or define measures for object-oriented systems. This situation is addressed and clarified through several different activities. First, a standardized terminology and formalism for expressing measures is provided which ensures that all measures using it are expressed in a fully consistent and operational manner. Second, to provide a structured synthesis, a review of the existing frameworks and measures for coupling measurement in object-oriented systems takes place. Third, a unified framework, based on the issues discovered in the review, is provided and all existing measures are then classified according to this framework. This paper contributes to an increased understanding of the state-of-the-art.","doi":"10.1109/32.748920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16169","startPage":"91","endPage":"121","pdfPath":"/iel4/32/16169/00748920.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.748920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified framework for coupling measurement in object-oriented systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software measurement","Terminology","Software quality","Measurement standards","Area measurement","Decision making","Object oriented modeling","Force measurement","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software metrics","object-oriented programming","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software measurement","object-oriented systems","object-oriented development techniques","coupling measurement","standardized terminology","standardized formalism","structured synthesis","unified framework"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"A unified framework for coupling measurement in object-oriented systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748920/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"25","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6185024","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified framework for coupling measurement in object-oriented systems","sourcePdf":"00748920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052379S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1999","isNumber":"16169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"430","articleId":"748920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":748925,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Three different transformation models-affine, bilinear and projective-as well as three optimization techniques-downhill simplex method, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms-are investigated and compared in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The registration of 26 pairs of fluoroscein angiography and indocyanine green chorioangiography images with the corresponding red-free retinal images, showed the superiority of combining genetic algorithms with the affine and bilinear transformation models. A comparative study of the proposed automatic registration scheme against the manual method, commonly used in clinical practice, is finally presented showing the advantage of the proposed automatic scheme in terms of accuracy and consistency.","doi":"10.1109/4233.748975","startPage":"47","endPage":"60","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/16172/00748975.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4233.748975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic retinal image registration scheme using global optimization techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Retina","Image registration","Radio frequency","Simulated annealing","Angiography","Genetic algorithms","Radiofrequency identification","Automatic testing","Optimization methods","Medical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image registration","eye","medical image processing","genetic algorithms","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic retinal image registration scheme","global optimization techniques","retinal modalities","clinical environment","image transformation model","function optimization techniques","initial preprocessing stage","affine model","bilinear model","projective model","downhill simplex method","simulated annealing","genetic algorithms","fluoroscein angiography image","indocyanine green chorioangiography images","red-free retinal images"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Angiography","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Retinal Vessels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748975/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Automatic retinal image registration scheme using global optimization techniques","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6191525","pubMedId":"10719503","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic retinal image registration scheme using global optimization techniques","sourcePdf":"00748975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048035S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"133","articleId":"748975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":748978,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The forward problem involves computing the scalp potentials or external magnetic field at a finite set of sensor locations for a putative source configuration. We present a unified treatment of analytical and numerical solutions of the forward problem in a form suitable for use in inverse methods. This formulation is achieved through factorization of the lead field into the product of the moment of the elemental current dipole source with a \"kernel matrix\" that depends on the head geometry and source and sensor locations, and a \"sensor matrix\" that models sensor orientation and gradiometer effects in MEG and differential measurements in EEG. Using this formulation and a recently developed approximation formula for EEG, based on the \"Berg parameters\", we present novel reformulations of the basic EEG and MEG kernels that dispel the myth that EEG is inherently more complicated to calculate than MEG. We also present novel investigations of different boundary element methods (BEMs) and present evidence that improvements over currently published BEM methods can be realized using alternative error-weighting methods. Explicit expressions for the matrix kernels for MEG and EEG for spherical and realistic head geometries are included.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.748978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16171","startPage":"245","endPage":"259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/16171/00748978.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEG and MEG: forward solutions for inverse methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"EEG and MEG: forward solutions for inverse methods","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6205905","pubMedId":"10097460","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG and MEG: forward solutions for inverse methods","sourcePdf":"00748978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068299S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"557","articleId":"748978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":748983,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper presents three supervised machine learning (ML) techniques for prediction of the activation patterns of muscles and sensory data, based on the history of sensory data, for walking assisted by a functional electrical stimulation (FES). Those ML's are: (1) a multilayer perceptron with Levenberg-Marquardt modification of backpropagation learning algorithm; (2) an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); and (3) a combination of an entropy minimization type of inductive learning (IL) technique and a radial basis function (RBF) type of artificial neural network with orthogonal least squares learning algorithm. Here we show the prediction of the activation of the knee flexor muscles and the knee joint angle for seven consecutive strides based on the history of the knee joint angle and the ground reaction forces. The data used for training and testing of ML's was obtained from a simulation of walking assisted with an FES system. The ability of generating rules for an FES controller was selected as the most important criterion when comparing the ML's. Other criteria such as generalization of results, computational complexity, and learning rate mere also considered. The minimal number of rules and the most explicit and comprehensible rules were obtained by ANFIS. The best generalization was obtained by the IL and RBF network.","doi":"10.1109/10.748983","startPage":"300","endPage":"310","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/16171/00748983.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.748983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three machine learning techniques for automatic determination of rules to control locomotion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Automatic control","Muscles","Knee","History","Legged locomotion","Inference algorithms","Backpropagation algorithms","Foot","Neuromuscular stimulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","learning by example","gait analysis","biocontrol","fuzzy neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","radial basis function networks","neuromuscular stimulation","computational complexity","physiological models","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","minimum entropy methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning techniques","automatic determination","locomotion control rules","automatic prediction","gait events","heel contact","flat foot","swing initiation","muscle activation profiles","real-time control of locomotion","supervised machine learning","sensory data","walking","functional electrical stimulation","multilayer perceptron","Levenberg-Marquardt modification","backpropagation learning algorithm","adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system","entropy minimization type","inductive learning","radial basis function","artificial neural network","orthogonal least squares learning algorithm","knee flexor muscles","knee joint angle","consecutive strides","ground reaction forces","generalization","computational complexity","learning rate","minimal number of rules","biomechanical model","subtractive clustering method"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biomechanics","Cluster Analysis","Entropy","Fuzzy Logic","Gait","Hip Joint","Humans","Knee Joint","Models, Biological","Muscle, Skeletal","Neural Networks (Computer)","Reference Values"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Three machine learning techniques for automatic determination of rules to control locomotion","volume":"46","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6205910","pubMedId":"10097465","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three machine learning techniques for automatic determination of rules to control locomotion","sourcePdf":"00748983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063339S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"76","articleId":"748983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":748984,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It is observed that the first two decomposed channels with highest energy are sufficient to reconstruct the ST-segment and J-point.

The originality of the method consists in the application of blind source separation techniques to obtain an observer of CSNA. We show how this observer can be deduced from a linear model of the cardiovascular system by introduction of the fundamental assumptions about the independence of the cardiac sympathetic an parasympathetic outflow. In cardiovascular applications, the reliability of the observer has been assessed by verification of the fundamental assumption for the given data. A primer qualitative validation has been performed using the muscle sympathetic nerve activity as an indirect indicator of CSNA. Very satisfying and promising results have been obtained. Moreover, we have performed quantitative validations of the observer in various experimental conditions known to elicit selectively cardiac sympathetic or parasympathetic response. The experimental conditions include a supine-to-60/spl deg/ tilt test, indirect sympathetic stimulation/inhibition by medication, and sympathetic stimulation by isometric handgrip. We show that the observer allows to highlight changing levels of the cardiac sympathetic activity in the LF band in all these experimental conditions.","doi":"10.1109/10.748985","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/16171/00748985.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.748985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16171","startPage":"322","endPage":"330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Observer of the human cardiac sympathetic nerve activity using noncausal blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Observer of the human cardiac sympathetic nerve activity using noncausal blind source separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748985/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6205912","pubMedId":"10097467","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observer of the human cardiac sympathetic nerve activity using noncausal blind source separation","sourcePdf":"00748985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046644S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"19","articleId":"748985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":748990,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

This invariant can be expressed as a linear form of the components of the distance distribution of the code with binomial numbers as coefficients. For this reason we call it a binomial moment of the distance distribution. Binomial moments appear in the proof of the MacWilliams (1963) identities and in many other problems of combinatorial coding theory. We introduce a linear programming problem for bounding these linear forms from below. It turns out that some known codes (1-error-correcting perfect codes, Golay codes, Nordstrom-Robinson code, etc.) yield optimal solutions of this problem, i.e., have minimal possible binomial moments of the distance distribution. We derive several general feasible solutions of this problem, which give lower bounds on the binomial moments of codes with given parameters, and derive the corresponding asymptotic bounds. Applications of these bounds include new lower bounds on the probability of undetected error for binary codes used over the binary-symmetric channel with crossover probability p and optimality of many codes for error detection. Asymptotic analysis of the bounds enables us to extend the range of code rates in which the upper bound on the undetected error exponent is tight.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16170/00748994.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.748994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.748994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16170","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binomial moments of the distance distribution: bounds and applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Binary codes","Upper bound","Vectors","Information theory","Laboratories","Postal services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","Golay codes","binary codes","error detection codes","linear programming","combinatorial mathematics","telecommunication channels","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binomial moments","distance distribution","combinatorial invariant","ordered pairs","codewords","subcodes","restricted support","binomial numbers","coefficients","MacWilliams identities","combinatorial coding theory","linear programming problem","linear forms","code rates","Golay codes","Nordstrom-Robinson code","optimal solutions","lower bounds","parameters","asymptotic bounds","undetected error probability","binary codes","binary-symmetric channel","crossover probability","error detection","1-error-correcting perfect codes","upper bound","undetected error exponent"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Binomial moments of the distance distribution: bounds and applications","volume":"45","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6198524","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binomial moments of the distance distribution: bounds and applications","sourcePdf":"00748994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028415S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"31","articleId":"748994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":748999,"authors":[{"name":"U.M.

Assume that two parties Alice and Bob and an adversary Eve have access to independent realizations of random variables X, Y, and Z, respectively, with joint distribution P/sub XYZ/. The secret-key rate S(X;Y/spl par/Z) has been defined as the maximal rate at which Alice and Bob can generate a secret key by communication over an insecure, but authenticated channel such that Eve's information about this key is arbitrarily small. We define a new conditional mutual information measure, the intrinsic conditional mutual information between S and Y when given Z, denoted by I(X;Y/spl darr/Z), which is an upper bound on S(X;Y/spl par/Z). The special scenarios are analyzed where X, Y, and Z are generated by sending a binary random variable R, for example a signal broadcast by a satellite, over independent channels, or two scenarios in which Z is generated by sending X and Y over erasure channels. In the first two scenarios it can be shown that the secret-key rate is strictly positive if and only if I(X;Y/spl darr/Z) is strictly positive. For the third scenario, a new protocol is presented which allows secret-key agreement even when all the previously known protocols fail.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16170/00748999.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.748999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.748999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16170","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=748999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unconditionally secure key agreement and the intrinsic conditional information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Communication channels","Random variables","Mutual information","Signal generators","Satellite broadcasting","Cryptographic protocols","Upper bound","Signal analysis","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public key cryptography","information theory","protocols","statistical analysis","telecommunication channels","random processes","message authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unconditionally secure key agreement","intrinsic conditional information","secret-key agreement","public discussion","joint distribution","secret-key rate","maximal rate","secret key generation","insecure authenticated channel","conditional mutual information measure","upper bound","binary random variable","satellite broadcast signal","independent channels","erasure channels","protocol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/748999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Unconditionally secure key agreement and the intrinsic conditional information","volume":"45","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6198529","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unconditionally secure key agreement and the intrinsic conditional information","sourcePdf":"00748999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07395S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"165","articleId":"748999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":749000,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For distortion measures which are \"locally quadratic\" a rigorous derivation of the asymptotic distortion and entropy-coded rate of multidimensional companders is given along with conditions for the optimal choice of the compressor function. This optimum compressor, when it exists, depends on the distortion measure but not on the source distribution. The rate-distortion performance of the companding scheme is studied using an asymptotic expression for the rate-distortion function which parallels the Shannon lower bound for difference distortion measures. It is proved that the high-resolution performance of the scheme is arbitrarily close to the rate-distortion limit for large quantizer dimensions if the compressor function and the lattice quantizer used in the companding scheme are optimal, extending an analogous statement for entropy-coded lattice quantization and MSE distortion.

Much of the previous work on the performance analysis of multiuser receivers has focused on their ability to reject worst case interference. Their performance in a power-controlled network and the resulting user capacity are less well-understood. We show that in a large system with each user using random spreading sequences, the limiting interference effects under several linear multiuser receivers can be decoupled, such that each interferer can be ascribed a level of effective interference that it provides to the user to be demodulated. Applying these results to the uplink of a single power-controlled cell, we derive an effective bandwidth characterization of the user capacity: the signal-to-interference requirements of all the users can be met if and only if the sum of the effective bandwidths of the users is less than the total number of degrees of freedom in the system. The effective bandwidth of a user depends only on its own SIR requirement, and simple expressions are derived for three linear receivers: the conventional matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE receiver. The effective bandwidths under the three receivers serve as a basis for performance comparison.","doi":"10.1109/18.749008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.749008","startPage":"641","endPage":"657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16170/00749008.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear multiuser receivers: effective interference, effective bandwidth and user capacity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/749008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Linear multiuser receivers: effective interference, effective bandwidth and user capacity","volume":"45","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6198538","publicationDate":"March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear multiuser receivers: effective interference, effective bandwidth and user capacity","sourcePdf":"00749008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02577S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"678","articleId":"749008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":749009,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The algorithm is devised based on a set of optimality conditions and the generation of a sequence of candidate codewords for an optimality test. The initial candidate codeword is generated by a simple decoding method. The subsequent candidate codewords, if needed, are generated by a chain of low-weight trellis searches, one at a time. Each search is conducted through a low-weight trellis diagram centered around the latest candidate codeword and results in an improvement over the previous candidate codewords that have been already tested. This improvement is then used as the next candidate codeword for a test of optimality. The decoding iteration stops whenever a candidate codeword is found to satisfy a sufficient condition on optimality or the latest low-weight trellis search results in a repetition of a previously generated candidate codeword. A divide-and-conquer technique is also presented for codes that are not spanned by their minimum-weight codewords. The proposed decoding algorithm has been applied to some well-known codes of lengths 48, 64, and 128. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves either practically optimal error performance for the example codes of length 48 and 64 or near optimal error performance for the (128, 29, 32) RM code with a significant reduction in computational decoding complexity.","doi":"10.1109/18.749023","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16170/00749023.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.749023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"731","endPage":"741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A low-weight trellis-based iterative soft-decision decoding algorithm for binary linear block codes","volume":"45","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6198553","publicationDate":"March 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/749023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-weight trellis-based iterative soft-decision decoding algorithm for binary linear block codes","sourcePdf":"00749023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049472S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"10","articleId":"749023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":749027,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Feedback information from the receiver is usually available at the transmitter only after some time delay. The capacity increase due to feedback depends on the feedback delay relative to the channel decorrelation time.

Two random coding upper bounds on the error probability of block codes are derived: a new bound and a simpler but looser bound assuming binary input distribution. Also, a new lower bound for any block code is derived using the strong converse to channel coding theorem. The lower bound shows that the new random coding upper bound is quite tight. Furthermore, it is shown that the maximum achievable diversity order in a block-fading channel with finite interleaving depends not only on the number of subchannels L, but also on the code rate R and that the performance can only marginally be improved by increasing the block length of the code. The random coding upper bound and the lower bound are shown to converge to the capacity outage for large channel block lengths N, demonstrating that the capacity outage can be used for estimating the error probability of coded diversity schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/749028/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6198558","volume":"45","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coded diversity on block-fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded diversity on block-fading channels","sourcePdf":"00749028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021928S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"163","articleId":"749028","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":749032,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Even for inexperienced designers, reliable and high-tolerance SDM coefficients for various applications can be automatically and efficiently generated using HOST. For synthesized SDM's with orders from three to eight and oversampling ratios from 32 to 256, coefficient variations within 2% (1% for the eighth order) are allowed and the resulting peak signal-to-noise ratio degradation is less than 3 dB.

In the first stage, a prototype filter is designed using a fast time-domain approximation. This is followed, in the second stage, where the design problem is formulated as a dynamic-programming-like recursive optimization problem, by a trellis search that optimizes the filter's frequency response. The proposed search algorithm, which iteratively designs filters that employ an increasing number of SPT terms, provides a means to control the filter's implementation complexity. Design examples demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of producing filters having a better frequency response than existing methods while using fewer SPT terms. We also show that the proposed algorithm can be used to design special FIR filters such as matched transmit and receive filters employing sums of signed-powers-of-two coefficients. Also presented is a modified algorithm that further reduces the required number of adders in a filter by exploiting redundancies within the coefficients.","doi":"10.1109/82.749079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/16168/00749079.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.749079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A trellis search algorithm for the design of FIR filters with signed-powers-of-two coefficients","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/749079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1999","displayDocTitle":"A trellis search algorithm for the design of FIR filters with signed-powers-of-two coefficients","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6200089","volume":"46","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A trellis search algorithm for the design of FIR filters with signed-powers-of-two coefficients","sourcePdf":"00749079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068606S","chronDate":"Jan.  1999","isNumber":"16168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"86","articleId":"749079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":749085,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This paper presents a number of novel models where state-space variables are selected in various different ways. The idea originates in the 'generalised flux' and 'generalised inductance' concept, which has recently been successfully developed and applied in the derivation of numerous models of saturated smooth air-gap AC machines. The concept is here extended to salient pole synchronous machines. Saturation itself is accounted for by means of a single saturation factor approach and conversion of an anisotropic to an isotropic machine is executed in the usual way. The new models, presented in the paper, yield the same accuracy as the existing models that are based on single saturation factor approach. This statement is confirmed by a simulation study and a sample of simulation results is included. However, a number of new models are considerably simpler than the existing ones, and thus more convenient for application in simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturation modelling in d-q axis models of salient pole synchronous machines","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/60.749146","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel4/60/16193/00749146.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.749146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=749146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/749146/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Saturation modelling in d-q axis models of salient pole synchronous machines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6192598","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saturation modelling in d-q axis models of salient pole synchronous machines","sourcePdf":"00749146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059388S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"86","articleId":"749146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":749147,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The validity of analysis is shown by good agreement between measured and calculated field current values of a 592 MVA turbine generator at various loads. It is clear that quantitative accuracy requires the magnetic coupling between d- and q-axis circuits be considered. Subsequently, steady-state reactances at various loads are analyzed by considering mutual reactances x/sub dq/ due to cross-magnetizing phenomenon.

The first issue is whether Web requests from a fixed user community are distributed according to Zipf's (1929) law. The second issue relates to a number of studies on the characteristics of Web proxy traces, which have shown that the hit-ratios and temporal locality of the traces exhibit certain asymptotic properties that are uniform across the different sets of the traces. In particular, the question is whether these properties are inherent to Web accesses or whether they are simply an artifact of the traces. An answer to these unresolved issues will facilitate both Web cache resource planning and cache hierarchy design. We show that the answers to the two questions are related. We first investigate the page request distribution seen by Web proxy caches using traces from a variety of sources. We find that the distribution does not follow Zipf's law precisely, but instead follows a Zipf-like distribution with the exponent varying from trace to trace. Furthermore, we find that there is only (i) a weak correlation between the access frequency of a Web page and its size and (ii) a weak correlation between access frequency and its rate of change. We then consider a simple model where the Web accesses are independent and the reference probability of the documents follows a Zipf-like distribution. We find that the model yields asymptotic behaviour that are consistent with the experimental observations, suggesting that the various observed properties of hit-ratios and temporal locality are indeed inherent to Web accesses observed by proxies. Finally, we revisit Web cache replacement algorithms and show that the algorithm that is suggested by this simple model performs best on real trace data. The results indicate that while page requests do indeed reveal short-term correlations and other structures, a simple model for an independent request stream following a Zipf-like distribution is sufficient to capture certain asymptotic properties observed at Web proxies.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1999.749260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1999.749260","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

Being able to be connected seamlessly anytime anywhere to the best network still remains an unfulfilled goal. Often, even determining the \"best\" network is a challenging task because of the widespread deployment of overlapping wireless networks. We describe a policy-enabled handoff system that allows users to express policies on what is the \"best\" wireless system at any moment, and make tradeoffs among network characteristics and dynamics such as cost, performance and power consumption. We designed a performance reporting scheme estimating current network conditions, which serves as input to the policy specification. A primary goal of this work is to make it possible to balance the bandwidth load across networks with comparable performance. To avoid the problem of handoff instability, i.e., many mobile hosts making the same handoff decision at essentially the same time, we designed randomization into our mechanism. Given the current \"best\" network, our system determines whether the handoff is worthwhile based on the handoff overhead and potential network usage duration.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings WMCSA'99.

We present Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), a novel algorithm for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. Each mobile host operates as a specialized router, and routes are obtained as needed (i.e., on-demand) with little or no reliance on periodic advertisements. Our new routing algorithm is quite suitable for a dynamic self starting network, as required by users wishing to utilize ad-hoc networks. AODV provides loop-free routes even while repairing broken links. Because the protocol does not require global periodic routing advertisements, the demand on the overall bandwidth available to the mobile nodes is substantially less than in those protocols that do necessitate such advertisements. Nevertheless we can still maintain most of the advantages of basic distance vector routing mechanisms. We show that our algorithm scales to large populations of mobile nodes wishing to form ad-hoc networks. We also include an evaluation methodology and simulation results to verify the operation of our algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/749281/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6182615","conferenceDate":"25-26 Feb. 1999","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00749281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034746S","chronDate":"25-26 Feb 1999","isNumber":"16183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6056","citationCount":"3181","articleId":"749281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":749282,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-B.

In so doing, we suggest an architecture, called IDMaps, whereby Internet distance information is distributed over the Internet, using IP multicast groups, in the form of a virtual distance map. Systems listening to the groups can estimate the distance between any pair of IP addresses by running a spanning tree algorithm over the received distance map.

The clocks on the end-systems used to measure the delays, however, are not always synchronized, and this lack of synchronization reduces the accuracy of these measurements. Therefore, estimating and removing relative skews and offsets from delay measurements between sender and receiver clocks are critical to the accurate assessment and analysis of network performance. We introduce a linear programming-based algorithm to estimate the clock skew in network delay measurements and compare it with three other algorithms. We show that our algorithm has a time complexity of O(N), leaves the delay after the skew removal positive, and is robust in the sense that the error margin of the skew estimate is independent of the magnitude of the skew. We use traces of real Internet delay measurements to assess the algorithm, and compare its performance to that of three other algorithms. Furthermore, we show through simulation that our algorithm is unbiased, and that the sample variance of the skew estimate is better (smaller) than existing algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation and removal of clock skew from network delay measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

Typically, a client requests service from a single mirror site. We consider enabling a client to access a file from multiple mirror sites in parallel to speed up the download. To eliminate complex client-server negotiations that a straightforward implementation of this approach would require, we develop a feedback-free protocol based on erasure codes. We demonstrate that a protocol using fast Tornado codes can deliver dramatic speedups at the expense of transmitting a moderate number of additional packets into the network. This scalable solution extends naturally to allow multiple clients to access data from multiple mirror sites simultaneously. The approach applies naturally to wireless networks and satellite networks as well.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1999.749293","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99. Conference on Computer Communications.

We present analysis of 128 hours of end-to-end unicast and multicast packet loss measurement. From these we selected 76 hours of stationary traces for further analysis. We consider the dependence as seen in the autocorrelation function of the original loss data as well as the dependence between good run lengths and loss run lengths. The correlation timescale is found to be 1000 ms or less. We evaluate the accuracy of three models of increasing complexity: the Bernoulli model, the 2-state Markov chain model and the k-th order Markov chain model. Out of the 38 trace segments considered, the Bernoulli model was found to be accurate for 7 segments, and the 2-state model was found to be accurate for 10 segments. A Markov chain model of order 2 or greater was found to be necessary to accurately model the rest of the segments. For the case of adaptive applications which track loss, we address two issues of on-line loss estimation: the required memory size and whether to use exponential smoothing or a sliding window average to estimate average loss rate. We find that a large memory size is necessary and that the sliding window average provides a more accurate estimate for the same effective memory size.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1999.749301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16198","startPage":"345","endPage":"352 vol.1","pdfPath":"/iel4/6063/16198/00749301.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

This proposed scheme is similar to service disciplines based on fair queuing, but instead of using only a single service rate for each session for its entire connection lifetime, multiple service rates are used. The service rate of any session at any point in time is computed efficiently based on the number of bits backlogged in the queues of the session and another imaginary reference session at that point in time. The main advantage of this scheme is that the queuing delays suffered by all the sessions connected to a single output node are minimised, leading to a smaller delay variation. In addition, this smaller delay variation also implies a smaller variance in the maximum queue length, thereby, reducing the possibility of buffer overflow.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

Then the problem to be solved becomes a continuous nonlinear and multivariate optimization problem with many local optima. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a global optimum. We propose a new method to convert the original problem into a discrete combinatorial optimization problem and solve the converted problem by a genetic algorithm. We construct individuals by considering candidates of the locations of knots as genes, and convert the continuous problem into a discrete problem. We search for the best model among the candidate models by using H. Akaike's (1974) Information Criterion (AIC). Our method can determine appropriate number and locations of knots automatically and simultaneously. We don't need any subjective parameters such as error tolerance or a smoothing factor, and good initial location of knots for iterative search. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/749336/","accessionNumber":"6182663","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-4 March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Automatic knot placement by a genetic algorithm for data fitting with a spline","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic knot placement by a genetic algorithm for data fitting with a spline","confLoc":"Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"00749336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03062S","chronDate":"1-4 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6058","citationCount":"48","articleId":"749336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":749351,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The system does not require an optical frequency synthesizer allowing high communication bit rates. Encoding and decoding are passively achieved by Bragg gratings, Multiple Bragg gratings replace a frequency synthesizer, achieving a hopping rate in tens of GHz. A main lobe sine apodization can be used in writing the gratings to enhance the system capacity and the spectrum efficiency. All network users can use the same tunable encoder/decoder design. The simultaneous utilization of the time and frequency domains offers notable flexibility in code selection. Simulations show that the encoder efficiently performs the FFH spread spectrum signal generation and that the receiver easily extracts the desired signal from a received signal for several multiple access interference scenarios. We measure the system performance in terms of bit error rate, as well as auto-to cross-correlation contrast. A transmission rate of 500 Mb/s per user is supported in a system with up to 30 simultaneous users at 10/sup -9/ bit error rate. We compare FFH-CDMA to several direct sequence-CDMA systems in terms of bit error rate versus the number of simultaneous users. We show that an optical FFH-CDMA system requires new design criteria for code families, as optical device technology differs significantly from that of radio frequency communications.","doi":"10.1109/50.749379","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/50/16187/00749379.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.749379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive optical fast frequency-hop CDMA communications system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Passive optical fast frequency-hop CDMA communications system","volume":"17","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6204869","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/749379/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive optical fast frequency-hop CDMA communications system","sourcePdf":"00749379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07103S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"225","articleId":"749379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":749381,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

Both upper and lower hounds on the bit error rate (BER) are derived taking into account the effect of both multiple-user interference and receiver shot noise. The photodiodes' dark currents are neglected since their effect is minor. The throughput limitation of this system is evaluated as well. Performance characteristics are then compared to optical CDMA systems employing traditional ON-OFF keying (OOK) and pulse-position modulation (PPM) schemes.

The investigation is focused on major steps in the device fabrication processes necessary to optimize transducer performance. Such steps include membrane formation, vacuum sealing, and electrode metallization. Three transducer membrane structures are evaluated: a nitride membrane with an oxide sacrificial layer; a polysilicon membrane with an oxide sacrificial layer; and a nitride membrane with a polysilicon sacrificial layer. Three vacuum sealing mechanisms are compared, each of which requires a different degree of lithographic sophistication, uses a particular sealing mechanism, and results in a sealed cavity. Submicrometer via sealing requires sophisticated lithography but is amenable to LPCVD nitride, LTO, and other sealing procedures. Standard g-line lithography results in vies which seal only with high sticking coefficient species, such as LTO. A novel etch channel structure, which results in lateral sealing and requires neither sophisticated lithography nor a particular sealing material, is demonstrated. Finally, the impact of electrode metallization on the impedance, bandwidth, and efficiency of the transducers is discussed. The experiments in the paper are guided by theoretical analysis and computer simulations when applicable. The new process results in optimized devices which have a broad-band 50-/spl Omega/ real part impedance in the megahertz range. A transducer dynamic range in excess of 100 dB is achieved around 4.5 MHz. An untuned transducer exhibits more than 100% bandwidth when connected to electronics with 50-/spl Omega/ input impedance. In addition, beam pattern measurement shows the immersion devices behave like uniform piston transducers and are readily suitable for array applications. The fabrication techniques and results herein reported indicate that surface micromachined ultrasonic immersion transducers are an attractive alternative to piezoelectric transducers in immersion applications.","doi":"10.1109/84.749409","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/16188/00749409.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.749409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabrication and characterization of surface micromachined capacitive ultrasonic immersion transducers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=749409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/749409/","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication and characterization of surface micromachined capacitive ultrasonic immersion transducers","volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6207712","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication and characterization of surface micromachined capacitive ultrasonic immersion transducers","sourcePdf":"00749409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057116S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"122","articleId":"749409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":749431,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The focus is quasi-static environments, such as multimedia classrooms, and situations characterized by real-time services and high traffic loads. In these cases, centralized control may be preferable due to its simplicity and high efficiency. Using a link loss matrix, an approach is proposed for selection of a network leader that takes into consideration link losses and transmitter powers. Both minimax and minisum criteria are developed to determine uplink, downlink, and overall leaders. A QoS-based iterative algorithm for determination of link transmit powers is also proposed, from which leader selection is obtained as a special case.

Volatile disk or file caches are sometimes used to delay the propagation of writes to disk (called delayed writes). While delayed writes improve system performance, volatile caches can cause the loss of vital data during sudden failure. In this study, we investigate managing non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) caches with different simple strategies to delay writes to disk. We evaluate the performance of NVRAM caches using three measures of merit: the number of stalled writes which wait while the cache is cleaned before being serviced the mean service time far I/O requests, and the number of writes generated by cleaning the cache. Our results show that even small non-volatile write caches using simple management policies can reduce the number of writes to disk by at least 70% and as much as 80% in some cases. Our results also show that the number of stalled writes is high: 30% at best and nearly 100% at worst. Adding pro-active purging effectively decreases both stalled writes and disk write activity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Random access memory","System performance","Propagation delay","Hardware","Software architecture","Delay systems","Read-write memory","Time measurement","Cleaning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-access storage","cache storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["non-volatile write caches","system performance","performance","NVRAM caches","management policies","pro-active purging"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=749455","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.1999.749455","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference (Cat.

The result of using /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulation is a spread in the spectrum of the conducted emissions so that large concentrations of power at discrete frequencies are avoided. Experimental time-domain waveforms and spectra of the switching function of first-order and second-order /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulators are presented to prove the viability of the scheme for EMI mitigation.

Today's voltage regulator module (VRM) will need a large amount of extra decoupling and output filter capacitors to meet future requirements, which basically makes the existing VRM topologies impractical. As a candidate topology, the interleaved quasi-square-wave (QSW) exhibits very good performance, such as fast transient response and very high power density. The limitation in the application of the interleaved parallel technology is current sharing control. In this paper, a novel current sensing and current sharing technique is proposed. With this technique, current sharing can be controlled simply in parallel converters without current transformer and current sensing resistors.

Also, the effect of different current excitation waveforms on the developed electromagnetic torque generated in 2-phase, 3-phase, and 5-phase BPM motors at full load is studied. Further, dynamic simulation is used to predict the torque ripple in these BPM motors. Simulation results are verified by experimental results obtained from 2-phase and 3-phase BPM motors. It is shown that for the same amount of copper loss, the 2-phase BPM motor is more cost effective as it gives higher average torque as well as peak torque. However, it generates deeper notches in the developed torque, Iron utilization is better in the 5-phase BPM motor.

The proposed topology of hybrid filter combines a shunt passive filter (PF) and a shunt active filter (AF). A series inductor between both the filters is introduced to create a harmonic voltage source at the input of nonlinear load. A diode bridge rectifier with R-C load is considered as a nonlinear load. An indirect current controlled voltage source inverter (ICC-VSI) is considered as an AF. A simple control algorithm based on proportional plus integral control of a self-supporting DC bus voltage of the shunt AF is implemented on a TMS320C31 DSP. The passive filter is tuned to compensate 5/sup th/ and 7/sup th/ harmonics, while the AF compensates the rest of harmonics of the load current. A laboratory prototype model of the proposed hybrid filter is developed and its performance is examined. Experimental results are given and discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/749761/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"6245577","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"14-18 March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Digital implementation of a new type of hybrid filter with simplified control strategy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital implementation of a new type of hybrid filter with simplified control strategy","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00749761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038569S","chronDate":"14-18 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059","citationCount":"20","articleId":"749761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
