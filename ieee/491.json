In this paper, we examine a technique to utilize a UHF RFID tag antenna as a displacement sensor by mapping structural deformation to a change in RFID tag characteristics. We evaluate how changes in two different parameters, a) tag backscatter power and b) minimum reader transmit power required for RFID chip activation, can be mapped to structural deformation. The theoretical principles of sensor development are first discussed followed by a presentation of the results of experimentation.

This paper presents the first multipath fading measurements for backscatter tags using multiple antennas at 5.79 GHz - the center of the 5.725-5.850 GHz, unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band that may offer reliable operation for future, miniature RF tags. NLOS measurement results are presented as cumulative density functions (CDF) and fade margins for use in backscatter radio link budget analysis and a detailed description of the custom backscatter testbed used to take the measurements is provided.

RFID has become one of the primarily means to construct a real-time locating system (RTLS) that tracks and identifies the location of objects in real time using simple, inexpensive tags attached to or embedded in objects and readers that receive the wireless signals from these tags to determine their locations. Most RFID tag localization techniques heavily rely on precise estimation of the range between a reader and the tags. Traditionally, range information is obtained from the received signal strength indication (RSSI). Such approach is inaccurate, particularly in a complicated propagation environment. Recent development on phase difference of arrival (PDOA) allows coherent signal processing for improved range estimation performance. Exploiting multiple frequencies may further improve the range estimation performance. In this paper, we focus on multifrequency-based techniques to achieve several important advantages in the range estimation of passive or semi-passive RFID tags. The use of well designed multiple frequencies allows effective phase upwrapping and elimination of the range ambiguity problem which may be encountered in PDOA methods. In a complicated propagation environment, the mutifrequency-based techniques provide frequency diversity for robust range estimation when signals are highly faded at some frequencies. These advantages not only yield improved range estimation accuracy of RFID tags in various applications, but also enable robust range estimation in challenging scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/RFID.2009.4911199","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on RFID","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on RFID","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850423/4911159/04911199.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID.2009.4911199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4911159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multifrequency-based range estimation of RFID Tags","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4911199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4911199/","displayDocTitle":"Multifrequency-based range estimation of RFID Tags","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10645378","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4911199/","conferenceDate":"27-28 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multifrequency-based range estimation of RFID Tags","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1569171759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101602S","chronDate":"27-28 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850423","isNumber":"4911159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850423","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4911159","articleId":"4911199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4911203,"authors":[{"name":"Dawei Shen","affiliation":["Media Laboratory, Viral Communications Group, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Dawei Shen","id":"37405083300"},{"name":"Grace Woo","affiliation":["Media Laboratory, Viral Communications Group, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Grace","lastName":"Woo","id":"37628178600"},{"name":"David P.

Finally, we describe how this technology can be used for touch interfaces as well as other applications with the addition of a LED for user feedback.","doi":"10.1109/RFID.2009.4911212","startPage":"103","endPage":"109","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on RFID","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID.2009.4911212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4911159","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on RFID","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850423/4911159/04911212.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A capacitive touch interface for passive RFID tags","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4911212/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A capacitive touch interface for passive RFID tags","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4911212/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10645391","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A capacitive touch interface for passive RFID tags","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1569173696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053228S","chronDate":"27-28 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850423","isNumber":"4911159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850423","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4911159","articleId":"4911212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4911577,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Castle","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Castle","id":"38179767900"},{"name":"Georg Klein","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Klein","id":"37572986800"},{"name":"David W.

In this paper, we consider the Montgomery multiplication in the binary extension fields and study different structures of bit-serial and bit-parallel multipliers. For each of these structures, we study the role of the Montgomery factor, and then by using appropriate factors, propose new architectures. Specifically, we propose two bit-serial multipliers for general irreducible polynomials, and then derive bit-parallel Montgomery multipliers for two important classes of irreducible polynomials. In this regard, first we consider trinomials and provide a way for finding efficient Montgomery factors which results in a low time complexity. Then, we consider type-II irreducible pentanomials and design two bit-parallel multipliers which are comparable to the best finite field multipliers reported in the literature. Moreover, we consider squaring using this family of irreducible polynomials and show that this operation can be performed very fast with the time complexity of two XOR gates.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.70","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5226180/04912195.pdf","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Serial and Bit-Parallel Montgomery Multiplication and Squaring over GF(2^m)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912195/","displayDocTitle":"Bit-Serial and Bit-Parallel Montgomery Multiplication and Squaring over GF(2^m)","volume":"58","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847104","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4912195/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Serial and Bit-Parallel Montgomery Multiplication and Squaring over GF(2^m)","sourcePdf":"ttc2009101332.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044865S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","isNumber":"5226180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"48","articleId":"4912195","onlineDate":"08 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4912202,"authors":[{"name":"Suyun Zhao","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Hebei University of Technology, Baoding, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5434317/4912202/4912202-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Suyun Zhao (M'06) received the bachelor's and master's degrees from the School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hebei University, Baoding, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

Some researchers studied on the rough approximation of fuzzy sets, while some others focused on studying one application of FRS: attribute reduction (i.e., feature selection). However, constructing classifier by using FRS, as another application of FRS, has been less studied. In this paper, we build a rule-based classifier by using one generalized FRS model after proposing a new concept named as \u00bfconsistence degree\u00bf which is used as the critical value to keep the discernibility information invariant in the processing of rule induction. First, we generalized the existing FRS to a robust model with respect to misclassification and perturbation by incorporating one controlled threshold into knowledge representation of FRS. Second, we propose a concept named as \u00bfconsistence degree\u00bf and by the strict mathematical reasoning, we show that this concept is reasonable as a critical value to reduce redundant attribute values in database. By employing this concept, we then design a discernibility vector to develop the algorithms of rule induction. The induced rule set can function as a classifier. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed rule-based classifier is feasible and effective on noisy data.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2009.118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5434317/04912202.pdf","startPage":"624","endPage":"638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2009.118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5434317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building a Rule-Based Classifier\u2014A Fuzzy-Rough Set Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912202/","displayDocTitle":"Building a Rule-Based Classifier\u2014A Fuzzy-Rough Set Approach","volume":"22","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11180154","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4912202/","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building a Rule-Based Classifier\u2014A Fuzzy-Rough Set Approach","sourcePdf":"ttk2010050624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130061S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5434317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"5434317","articleId":"4912202","onlineDate":"08 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4912211,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Rozner","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5291226/4912211/4912211-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eric Rozner received the BS degree from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 2005.

Routing protocols are critical to the performance and reliability of wireless mesh networks. Traditional routing protocols send traffic along predetermined paths and face difficulties in coping with unreliable and unpredictable wireless medium. In this paper, we propose a simple opportunistic adaptive routing protocol (SOAR) to explicitly support multiple simultaneous flows in wireless mesh networks. SOAR incorporates the following four major components to achieve high throughput and fairness: 1) adaptive forwarding path selection to leverage path diversity while minimizing duplicate transmissions, 2) priority timer-based forwarding to let only the best forwarding node forward the packet, 3) local loss recovery to efficiently detect and retransmit lost packets, and 4) adaptive rate control to determine an appropriate sending rate according to the current network conditions. We implement SOAR in both NS-2 simulation and an 18-node wireless mesh testbed. Our extensive evaluation shows that SOAR significantly outperforms traditional routing and a seminal opportunistic routing protocol, ExOR, under a wide range of scenarios.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5291226/04912211.pdf","endPage":"1635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOAR: Simple Opportunistic Adaptive Routing Protocol for Wireless Mesh Networks","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.82","startPage":"1622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"SOAR: Simple Opportunistic Adaptive Routing Protocol for Wireless Mesh Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912211/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10940663","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4912211/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SOAR: Simple Opportunistic Adaptive Routing Protocol for Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2009121622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080942S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5291226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"5291226","articleId":"4912211","onlineDate":"08 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4912213,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Levinshtein","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Levinshtein","id":"37397892800"},{"name":"Adrian Stere","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Stere","id":"37644911400"},{"name":"Kiriakos N.

It produces segments that, on one hand, respect local image boundaries, while, on the other hand, limiting undersegmentation through a compactness constraint. It is very fast, with complexity that is approximately linear in image size, and can be applied to megapixel sized images with high superpixel densities in a matter of minutes. We show qualitative demonstrations of high-quality results on several complex images. The Berkeley database is used to quantitatively compare its performance to a number of oversegmentation algorithms, showing that it yields less undersegmentation than algorithms that lack a compactness constraint while offering a significant speedup over N-cuts, which does enforce compactness.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5291213/04912213.pdf","startPage":"2290","endPage":"2297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TurboPixels: Fast Superpixels Using Geometric Flows","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Cost function","Shape control","Linear approximation","Image databases","Labeling","Pixel","Training data","Computational efficiency","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","geometry","image resolution","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TurboPixels","fast superpixels","geometric flows","dense oversegmentation","superpixels","Berkeley database","N-cuts","image segmentation","image labeling","perceptual grouping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Superpixels","image segmentation","image labeling","perceptual grouping."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"TurboPixels: Fast Superpixels Using Geometric Flows","volume":"31","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4912213/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930880","pubMedId":"19834148","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TurboPixels: Fast Superpixels Using Geometric Flows","sourcePdf":"ttp2009122290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083447S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5291213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"774","xplore-issue":"5291213","articleId":"4912213","onlineDate":"08 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4912217,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Jenssen","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Technology, University of Troms\u00f8, Tromso, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5432924/4912217/4912217-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert Jenssen received the degree of Dr Scient (PhD) in electrical engineering in 2005 from the University of Troms\u00f8, Norway, where he is currently an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Technology.

Kernel ECA reveals structure relating to the Renyi entropy of the input space data set, estimated via a kernel matrix using Parzen windowing. This is achieved by projections onto a subset of entropy preserving kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) axes. This subset does not need, in general, to correspond to the top eigenvalues of the kernel matrix, in contrast to the dimensionality reduction using kernel PCA. We show that kernel ECA may produce strikingly different transformed data sets compared to kernel PCA, with a distinct angle-based structure. A new spectral clustering algorithm utilizing this structure is developed with positive results.

These devices are based on intracavity difference-frequency generation in dual-wavelength mid-IR QCLs, and can now provide microwatt levels of coherent THz radiation up to room temperature.

By using the OSIC algorithm and the maximum-likelihood (ML) metric, the proposed method achieves near-ML performance without requiring a large number of candidates. Although the proposed method can be used for both hard and soft decoding systems, it is particularly useful for soft decoding systems since the log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) values for all the bits can efficiently be computed without using LLR estimation. The proposed method is also suitable for very large scale integration (VLSI) implementation since it leads to a fixed throughput system.

Pure wireless ad hoc networks with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) distributed communications have also been shown to scale. A natural question arises: Do hybrid wireless networks always scale no matter how many base stations are placed if MIMO distributed communications are used? In this paper, we address this question and show that hybrid wireless networks cannot always scale with the proposed resource-allocation strategy. Specifically, they can only scale either when m = Theta(1) and all resources are exclusively allocated to ad hoc mode transmissions or when m = Theta(n), and all resources are exclusively allocated to infrastructure mode transmissions; moreover, the delay is significantly large in the first case, whereas it is Theta(1) in the second case, where Theta(f(n)) means on the order of f(n) when n is large.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2022533","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"4620","endPage":"4627","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04912341.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2022533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput and Delay in Cooperative Wireless Networks With Partial Infrastructure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Wireless networks","Mobile ad hoc networks","Wireless personal area networks","Base stations","MIMO","Resource management","Laboratories","Intserv networks","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","MIMO communication","mobile radio","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless ad hoc network","multiple-input-multiple-output distributed communication","MIMO system","resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay","hybrid wireless networks","scaling law","throughput capacity","wireless ad hoc networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Throughput and Delay in Cooperative Wireless Networks With Partial Infrastructure","volume":"58","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10903068","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4912341/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912341/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput and Delay in Cooperative Wireless Networks With Partial Infrastructure","sourcePdf":"tvt-fang-2022533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0788S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4912341","onlineDate":"08 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4912342,"authors":[{"name":"Dorothy A.

In an uncontrolled environment, a speech classifier should be adaptive to different users and robust to noisy environments. It is usually observed that specific features and classifiers are more appropriate to parts of the problem domain than others; therefore, we propose a self-optimizing approach in which multiple feature extraction and classification techniques are simultaneously considered. The system uses a genetic algorithm to simultaneously select features and classifier, and the results from multiple classifiers are then combined using the Dempster-Shafer theory.

Theoretical analysis of the effect of fiber dispersion, optical transmitter, and optical receiver response on system performance is carried out considering amplitude and phase distortion. Experiments are conducted and verified by our theoretical analysis and good agreement is obtained. It is found that RF modulation index of ~4% is optimum for optical transmitter with Mach-Zehnder modulator, and optical receiver with Chebyshev-II response is the best for MB-OFDM UWB over fiber. Compared to back-to-back UWB over fiber, optical transmission is mainly limited by laser phase noise converted relative intensity noise and phase distortion induced by fiber dispersion when optimum modulation index is used. Higher modulation index is limited by amplitude and phase distortion to OFDM signal induced by optical transmitter and receiver response nonlinearities and fiber dispersion and the spectral mask. It is also found that highly received optical power is required for transmission of MB-OFDM UWB signal over fiber.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5208445/04912353.pdf","startPage":"4112","endPage":"4123","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2022508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2022508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208445","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Optical Transmission on Multiband OFDM Ultra-Wideband Wireless System With Fiber Distribution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Ultra wideband technology","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Optical modulation","Optical distortion","Optical fiber dispersion","Phase distortion","Optical noise","Phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","light transmission","OFDM modulation","optical fibre communication","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical transmission","multiband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","ultra-wideband wireless system","fiber distribution","data rate access","fiber transmission system","optical modulation","phase distortion","RF modulation","Mach-Zehnder modulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiband OFDM","optical fiber communication","radio over fiber","subcarrier modulation","ultra-wideband wireless communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Optical Transmission on Multiband OFDM Ultra-Wideband Wireless System With Fiber Distribution","volume":"27","issue":"18","htmlLink":"/document/4912353/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10836778","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Optical Transmission on Multiband OFDM Ultra-Wideband Wireless System With Fiber Distribution","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhang-2022508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082819S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5208445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5208445","articleId":"4912353","onlineDate":"08 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4912355,"authors":[{"name":"Huisheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China","Applied Mathematics Department, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Huisheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37635191400"},{"name":"Wei Wu","affiliation":["Applied Mathematics Department, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37423052900"},{"name":"Fei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of Missouri, Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37631009600"},{"name":"Mingchen Yao","affiliation":["Applied Mathematics Department, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Mingchen","lastName":"Yao","id":"37636201100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4912355","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":531},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Gradient methods","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Cost function","Mathematics","Automatic control","Stochastic processes","Approximation methods","Quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundedness","online gradient method","feedforward neural networks","network training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boundedness","convergence","feedforward neural networks","online gradient method","penalty"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912355","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2020848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","abstract":"In this brief, we consider an online gradient method with penalty for training feedforward neural networks.

Among the several wind generation technologies, variable speed wind turbines utilizing doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are gaining momentum in the power industry. With the increase in penetration of these wind turbines, the power system dominated by synchronous machines will experience a change in dynamics and operational characteristics. Given this assertion, the present paper develops an approach to analyze the impact of increased penetration of DFIG-based wind turbines on transient and small signal stability of a large power system. The primary basis of the method is to convert the DFIG machines into equivalent conventional round rotor synchronous machines and then evaluate the sensitivity of the eigenvalues with respect to inertia. In this regard, modes that are both detrimentally and beneficially affected by the change in inertia are identified. These modes are then excited by appropriate disturbances and the impact of reduced inertia on transient stability performance is also examined. The proposed technique is tested on a large test system representing the Midwestern portion of the U.S. interconnection. The results obtained indicate that the proposed method effectively identifies both detrimental and beneficial impacts of increased DFIG penetration both for transient stability and small signal stability related performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Increased Penetration of DFIG-Based Wind Turbine Generators on Transient and Small Signal Stability of Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2021234","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5170200/04912364.pdf","startPage":"1426","endPage":"1434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2021234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Increased Penetration of DFIG-Based Wind Turbine Generators on Transient and Small Signal Stability of Power Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4912364/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793407","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Increased Penetration of DFIG-Based Wind Turbine Generators on Transient and Small Signal Stability of Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-gautam-2021234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10109S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5170200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"482","xplore-issue":"5170200","articleId":"4912364","onlineDate":"08 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4912371,"authors":[{"name":"Kim Roberts","affiliation":["Nortel, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5170198/4912371/4912371-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kim Roberts (S'81\u2013M'84) received the B.A.Sc. and M.A.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.","He has innovated in the areas of optical transmission and high-capacity packet connections since 1984.

The chip consists of eight 16-channel front-end recording blocks, spike detection and feature extraction digital signal processor (DSP), ultra wideband (UWB) transmitter, and on-chip bias generators. Each recording channel has amplifiers with programmable gain and bandwidth to accommodate different types of biological signals. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) shared by 16 amplifiers through time-multiplexing results in a balanced trade-off between the power consumption and chip area. A nonlinear energy operator (NEO) based spike detector is implemented for identifying spikes, which are further processed by a digital frequency-shaping filter. The computationally efficient spike detection and feature extraction algorithms attribute to an auspicious DSP implementation on-chip. UWB telemetry is designed to wirelessly transfer raw data from 128 recording channels at a data rate of 90 Mbit/s.

However, this issue is well known as a nonlinear, multimodal and mixed-variable problem. In the last decades, computation intelligence-based techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), differential evolution (DE) algorithms and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, etc., have often been used for this aim. In this work, a seeker optimization algorithm (SOA)-based reactive power dispatch method is proposed. The SOA is based on the concept of simulating the act of human searching, where the search direction is based on the empirical gradient by evaluating the response to the position changes and the step length is based on uncertainty reasoning by using a simple Fuzzy rule. In this study, the algorithm's performance is evaluated on benchmark function optimization. Then, the SOA is applied to optimal reactive power dispatch on standard IEEE 57- and 118-bus power systems, and compared with conventional nonlinear programming method, two versions of GAs, three versions of DE algorithms and four versions of PSO algorithms. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is superior to the other listed algorithms and can be efficiently used for optimal reactive power dispatch.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10793423","htmlLink":"/document/4912428/","displayDocTitle":"Seeker Optimization Algorithm for Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seeker Optimization Algorithm for Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs03-cdai-2021226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12428S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5170200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"5170200","articleId":"4912428","onlineDate":"08 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4912437,"authors":[{"name":"Elad Alon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/4982886/4912437/4912437-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Elad Alon (S'02\u2013M'06) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2001, 2002, and 2006, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","In January 2007, he joined the University of California, Berkeley, as an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, where he is now a co-director of the Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC).

The models of the interconnects have to be broadband and accurate to represent high frequency and second-order effects such as frequency dependence of dielectric losses and surface roughness. The large and small signal behaviors of the transmitter and receiver circuitries have to be correctly represented in link analysis. In addition, the system simulation needs to properly capture the interactions between the circuits and interconnect subsystems to optimize the overall system. However, determining the values of the critical link parameters and their correlations can be complicated. Some of the key parameters are not deterministic and some cannot be observed directly. A combined modeling and measurement approach is indispensable to determine the performance of high-speed links. This paper presents the modeling and characterization techniques employed in the design and verification of a 16 Gb/s bidirectional asymmetrical memory interface. Direct frequency and time-domain methods as well as indirect techniques based on bit-error-rate testing are used to model and determine important link parameters. Complex de-embedding procedures are utilized to extract parameters from externally observed data. On-chip measurements are also used to complement off-chip instrumentation and accurately measure the true performance of the link. The modeling and characterization of prototypes are also discussed and model-to-hardware correlations are presented at component and system levels. Based on both simulation and measurement results, the behavioral model of the complete system is constructed and statistical simulation technique is used to predict the yield and performance at low bit error rate.","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2009.2018460","startPage":"306","endPage":"327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2009.2018460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982886","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/4982886/04912448.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Modeling and Accurate Characterization of a 16 Gb/s Memory Interface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912448/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Advanced Modeling and Accurate Characterization of a 16 Gb/s Memory Interface","volume":"32","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4912448/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10684910","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Modeling and Accurate Characterization of a 16 Gb/s Memory Interface","sourcePdf":"tadvp-wbeyene-2018460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098181S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"4982886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4982886","articleId":"4912448","onlineDate":"08 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":4912454,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsung Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5071758/4912454/4912454-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinsung Choi (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2004 and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at POSTECH.","His main interests are analog/RF circuit design in ultra deep sub-micrometer CMOS technology, mixed-mode signal-processing integrated-circuit design, and digitally assisted RF transceiver architectures.","Mr. Choi was the recipient of the Bronze Prize of the Human-Tech Thesis Prize presented by Samsung Electronics in 2009."]},"firstName":"Jinsung","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405962600"},{"name":"Daehyun Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5071758/4912454/4912454-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Daehyun Kang (S'08) received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2006, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea.","His research interests include the design of PAs and highly efficient and linear transmitters."]},"firstName":"Daehyun","lastName":"Kang","id":"37289143600"},{"name":"Dongsu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5071758/4912454/4912454-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Dongsu Kim received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2007, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at POSTECH.","His research interests are CMOS RF circuits for wireless communications, with a special focus on highly efficient and linear RF transmitter design."]},"firstName":"Dongsu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37068059400"},{"name":"Bumman Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5071758/4912454/4912454-photo-4-source-small.gif","p":["Bumman Kim (M'78\u2013SM'97\u2013F'07) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 1979.","From 1978 to 1981, he was engaged in fiber-optic network component research with GTE Laboratories Inc.

It results in a reduced chip size and the crest factor of the supply modulating signal is reduced by 6 dB, enhancing the efficiency of the supply modulator. The designed ET transmitter consisting of the Doherty amplifier and the supply modulator are fabricated in 2- mum HBT and 0.13-mum CMOS processes, respectively. It presents the efficiency improvement over the broad output power region. Especially at the 16-dB backed-off power level, more than 23% of power-added efficiency (PAE) is achieved.

To mimic the biological olfactory system, temperature modulation is first used to virtually increase the number of sensors by periodically sampling the sensors' response at different temperatures. A convex microhotplate is used in order to improve the thermal properties of the structure enabling efficient temperature modulation process to be carried out. Temperature modulation is shown to increase the number of effective sensors from 16 physically available sensors (integrated on a single chip) to 12 000 virtual sensors (VSs). This enables the emulation of a very large number of sensors typically found in biological systems. The response of each sensor is seen as a fingerprint map, which is further processed using various image processing techniques. Self organized maps (SOMs) algorithm is used to create a 2D map for each gas and to combine the huge number of VSs in order to reduce the dimensionality. Image moments are used as a feature enabling to characterize the spatial distribution within the image lattice and to retrieve the brighter regions in the SOM' nodes exhibiting high activity to the input gas. Experiments on real sensors data show improved performance (96%) as compared with standard gas discrimination algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Pattern Recognition System for Tin-Oxide Gas Sensor Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2009.2020116","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/4897226/04912577.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2009.2020116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912577/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Pattern Recognition System for Tin-Oxide Gas Sensor Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4912577/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10691375","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-Inspired Pattern Recognition System for Tin-Oxide Gas Sensor Applications","sourcePdf":"jsen-abermak-2020116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083744S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"4897226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4897226","articleId":"4912577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4912588,"authors":[{"name":"Linlin Gu","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4815917/4912588/4912588-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Linlin Gu was born in Jiangsu Province, China, in 1984.

In doing so, film capacitors can be adopted instead of electrolytic capacitors to achieve a long power suppliespsila lifetime. The voltage ripple of the storage capacitor is intentionally increased to reduce the storage capacitance. The method of determining the storage capacitance for ensuring that the boost power factor correction converter operates normally in the whole input voltage range is also discussed. For the purpose of further reducing the storage capacitance, a method of injecting the third harmonic current into the input current flow is proposed. While ensuring that the input power factor is always higher than 0.9 to comply with regulation standards such as ENERGY STAR, the storage capacitance can be reduced to 65.6% of that with an input power factor of 1. A 60-W experimental prototype is built to verify the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2016662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4815917/04912588.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2016662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815917","startPage":"1399","endPage":"1408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Means of Eliminating Electrolytic Capacitor in AC/DC Power Supplies for LED Lightings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Means of Eliminating Electrolytic Capacitor in AC/DC Power Supplies for LED Lightings","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912588/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10691382","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4912588/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Means of Eliminating Electrolytic Capacitor in AC/DC Power Supplies for LED Lightings","sourcePdf":"tpel-gu-2016662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094352S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4815917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"311","xplore-issue":"4815917","articleId":"4912588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4912627,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Accurate load forecasting is the first step to enhance the UC solution. Lagrange relaxation (LR) method is used for solving the UC problem. Total costs calculated for the actual load and two different forecasting load data are compared. Four-unit Tuncbilek thermal plant which is in Kutahya region, Turkey, is used for this analysis.

Firstly, a transmission network reduction is applied to find an equivalent for assessing composite reliability for practical large power systems. After that, in order to classify the operating states, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based on Group Method Data Handling (GMDH) techniques are used to capture the patterns of the operating states, during the beginning of the non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The idea is to provide the simulation process with an intelligent memory, based only on polynomial parameters, to speed up the evaluation of the operating states. For the conventional reliability assessment, the ANNs are used to classify the operating states into success and failure. However, for the well-being analysis, only success states are classified into healthy and marginal by the ANNs. The proposed methodology is applied to the IEEE Reliability Test System 1996 and to a configuration of the Brazilian South- Southeastern System.","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Probablistic Methods Applied to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912595/4912596/04912649.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Probablistic Methods Applied to Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks Applied to Reliability and Well-Being Assessment of Composite Power Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system reliability","Artificial neural networks","Power system simulation","Power system analysis computing","Data handling","Polynomials","System testing","Pattern analysis","Failure analysis","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","Monte Carlo methods","neural nets","power engineering computing","power generation reliability","power transmission reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","power system reliability","composite generation","transmission system","ANN","group method data handling technique","nonsequential Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks Applied to Reliability and Well-Being Assessment of Composite Power Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4912649/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10646179","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Networks Applied to Reliability and Well-Being Assessment of Composite Power Systems","confLoc":"Rincon, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"PMAPS 2008 - PAPER 060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064317S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4912595","isNumber":"4912596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912595","xplore-issue":"4912596","articleId":"4912649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4912663,"authors":[{"name":"G.

To save storage capacity, a MOD generally stores simplified trajectories only. A simplified trajectory approximates the actual trajectory of the mobile object according to a certain accuracy bound. In order to minimize the costs of communicating position information between mobile object and MOD, the trajectory simplification should be performed by the mobile object. To assure that the MOD always has a valid simplified trajectory of the remote object, we propose the generic remote trajectory simplification protocol (GRTS) allowing for computing and managing a simplified trajectory in such a system in real-time. We show how to combine GRTS with existing line simplification algorithms for computing the simplified trajectory and analyze trade-offs between the different algorithms. Our evaluations show that GRTS outperforms the two existing approaches by a factor of two and more in terms of reduction efficiency. Moreover, on average, the reduction efficiency of GRTS is only 12% worse compared to optimal offline simplification.","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912767","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906860/4912739/04912767.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912739","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remote real-time trajectory simplification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Remote real-time trajectory simplification","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912767/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10629445","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4912767/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote real-time trajectory simplification","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077955S","chronDate":"9-13 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906860","isNumber":"4912739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906860","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4912739","articleId":"4912767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4912776,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Gu","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Tao Gu","id":"37087396461"},{"name":"Zhanqing Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China"],"lastName":"Zhanqing Wu","id":"37087395865"},{"name":"Xianping Tao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China"],"lastName":"Xianping Tao","id":"37087397097"},{"name":"Hung Keng Pung","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China"],"firstName":"Hung Keng","lastName":"Pung","id":"37298400100"},{"name":"Jian Lu","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Jian Lu","id":"37087397308"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4912776","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1603},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Pervasive computing","Humans","Wearable sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Smart homes","Laboratories","Concurrent computing","Machine learning","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","ubiquitous computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["epSICAR","concurrent activity recognition","interleaved recognition","sequential recognition","pervasive computing","learning-based models","real smart home","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["activity recognition","emerging patterns","sequential, interleaved and concurrent activities","wireless sensor networks"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"epSICAR: An Emerging Patterns based approach to sequential, interleaved and Concurrent Activity Recognition","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912739","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906860/4912739/04912776.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912776","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912776","abstract":"Recognizing human activities from sensor readings has recently attracted much research interest in pervasive computing. This task is particularly challenging because human activities are often performed in not only a simple (i.e., sequential), but also a complex (i.e., interleaved and concurrent) manner in real life. In this paper, we propose a novel emerging patterns based approach to sequential, interleaved and concurrent activity recognition (epSICAR). We exploit emerging patterns as powerful discriminators to differentiate activities. Different from other learning-based models built upon the training dataset for complex activities, we build our activity models by mining a set of emerging patterns from the sequential activity trace only and apply these models in recognizing sequential, interleaved and concurrent activities. We conduct our empirical studies in a real smart home, and the evaluation results demonstrate that with a time slice of 15 seconds, we achieve an accuracy of 90.96% for sequential activity, 87.98% for interleaved activity and 78.58% for concurrent activity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10629454","htmlLink":"/document/4912776/","conferenceDate":"9-13 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"epSICAR: An Emerging Patterns based approach to sequential, interleaved and Concurrent Activity Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"epSICAR: An Emerging Patterns based approach to sequential, interleaved and Concurrent Activity Recognition","confLoc":"Galveston, TX","sourcePdf":"031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129033S","chronDate":"9-13 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906860","isNumber":"4912739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906860","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4912739","articleId":"4912776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4912783,"authors":[{"name":"Sourish Dasgupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas City, USA"],"firstName":"Sourish","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37634041200"},{"name":"Satish Bhat","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas City, USA"],"firstName":"Satish","lastName":"Bhat","id":"37624934500"},{"name":"Yugyung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas City, USA"],"firstName":"Yugyung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281120000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4912783","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pervasive computing","Context-aware services","Indexing","Service oriented architecture","Adaptive systems","Cities and towns","Context modeling","Logic","Computer vision","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","indexing","query processing","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event driven service composition","pervasive computing","pervasive services","dynamic representations","functional modules","spatial information","temporal information","information flow","activity network","causal relations","semantic relations","contextual entities","dynamic workflows","data structure","activity logic graphs","dynamic pervasive environment","recognition process","indexing technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pevsive computing","event","service composition","indexing","context"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event driven service composition for pervasive computing","abstract":"Pervasive Computing plays an integral role in our daily life. As pervasive services become increasingly important to be able to capture context, it is reasonable to speculate that dynamic representations for composition of services is very much needed. Such representations may typically include activities or functional modules that are not only temporal but also responsive to each other. Such actions may be associated with actors who execute them, spatial and temporal information, information-flow and background objects. Consequently, one may model an activity network that depicts causal relations between activities and has the capability of embedding the semantic relations of these activities with other contextual entities. In this paper we discuss a new way of representing such dynamic workflows with a novel data structure called activity logic graphs (ALGs). We introfduce a novel design of an architecture that grasps the semantics of activities (or events) in dynamic pervasive environments, maps that to a collaboration of services (as ALGs) in order to recognize specific situations (known as Situation Boundaries) that has risen out of the events, and implements the recognition process using an efficient indexing technique. We test the model with a set of ALGs and report experimental results on the queries that are essential for service composition.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912783","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912783","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906860/4912739/04912783.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912783/","displayDocTitle":"Event driven service composition for pervasive computing","conferenceDate":"9-13 March 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10629460","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4912783/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event driven service composition for pervasive computing","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055354S","chronDate":"9-13 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906860","isNumber":"4912739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906860","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4912739","articleId":"4912783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4912796,"authors":[{"name":"Lun-Wu Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lun-Wu","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37409067400"},{"name":"Che-Yen Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Che-Yen","lastName":"Lu","id":"37406436400"},{"name":"Yu-Hsuan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Hsuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37068283200"},{"name":"Jia-Liang Liao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Liang","lastName":"Liao","id":"38182167300"},{"name":"Yu-Chee Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chee","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37276276400"},{"name":"Chien Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293083500"},{"name":"Chih-Wei Yi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Wei","lastName":"Yi","id":"37269745000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4912796","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lamps","Light emitting diodes","Light sources","Wireless sensor networks","Actuators","ZigBee","Robot sensing systems","Microprocessors","Solid modeling","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LED lamps","personal area networks","sensors","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iLamp","sensor-enhanced desk lamp","surface-tracking capability","light intensity","ZigBee-enabled sensor node","user-friendly interface","two-way communication capability","LED","luminous intensity","centimeter-level location-tracking system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LED","light control","location tracking","pervasive computing","sensor","wireless sensor network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912796","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912739","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906860/4912739/04912796.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iLamp: A sensor-enhanced lamp with surface-tracking capability based on light intensity","abstract":"The iLamp system is a sensor-enhanced desk lamp with surface-tracking capability based on received light intensity.

We show that the performance of our previously developed algorithms for detection in a controlled environments, which achieved 100% recall and precision, degrades significantly when tested in a real environment.

They use multi-hop radio communications to deliver multi-service (voice, data, and video) information. Each network element can either send a packet or receive a packet but not both. Therefore, synchronization between radios must be achieved for every packet scheduling time with minimal amount of time to ensure QoS provisioning. This paper presents a novel distributed synchronization scheme for radio communication in a TD/CDMA based MANET and Sensor Networks. The scheme is designed using a first order Digital Phase locked loop (DPLL) which performs the dasialocal lockingpsila at each receiver radio in a cluster of radios. The method exploits the clock drifts in each local clock of a radio with reference to which the local stored clocks are phase adjusted within the loop of the DPLL. A parameter called dasiaphase adjustment indexpsila represented by dasiaNpsila- an integer; is defined and is used as the scaling value of the local clock frequency. Analytical results have been shown to yield an effectively reduced size of overhead when compared to the overhead sizes dedicated for synchronization purpose in IEEE 802.11. The results have been verified by simulation in MATLAB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906860/4912739/04912841.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912739","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient distributed synchronization method for TD/CDMA based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Mobile ad hoc networks","Frequency synchronization","Clocks","Radio communication","Base stations","Poles and towers","Bandwidth","Scheduling algorithm","Phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","code division multiple access","digital phase locked loops","quality of service","radio networks","synchronisation","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed synchronization method","TD/CDMA","mobile ad hoc networks","sensor networks","multi-hop radio communications","multi-service information","packet scheduling time","digital phase locked loop","time division multiplexing","voltage controlled oscillator","quality of service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MANET","Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)","PLL","Scheduling","Phase error","Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)","QoS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"An efficient distributed synchronization method for TD/CDMA based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4912841/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10629512","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"9-13 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient distributed synchronization method for TD/CDMA based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044409S","chronDate":"9-13 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906860","isNumber":"4912739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906860","xplore-issue":"4912739","articleId":"4912841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4912868,"authors":[{"name":"Chittabrata Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Chittabrata","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37396676500"},{"name":"Carlos Cordeiro","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Cordeiro","id":"37277649400"},{"name":"Dharma P.

The state of the sub-band at any time point is either free (unoccupied by a PU) or busy (occupied by a PU). The states of a sub-band are monitored over L consecutive time periods, where each period is of a given time interval. Existing research assume the presence of a Markov chain for sub-band utilization by PUs over time, but this assumption has not been validated. Therefore, in this paper we validate existence of a Markov chain for sub-band utilization using real-time measurements collected in the paging band (928-948 MHz). Furthermore, since the detection of idle sub-bands by a cognitive radio is prone to errors, we probabilistically model the errors and then formulate a spectrum sensing paradigm as a hidden Markov model that predicts the true states of a sub-band. The accuracy of our proposed method in predicting the true states of the sub-band is substantiated using extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912868","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906860/4912739/04912868.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Markov chain existence and Hidden Markov models in spectrum sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912868/","displayDocTitle":"Markov chain existence and Hidden Markov models in spectrum sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10629536","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4912868/","conferenceDate":"9-13 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markov chain existence and Hidden Markov models in spectrum sensing","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045551S","chronDate":"9-13 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906860","isNumber":"4912739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906860","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4912739","articleId":"4912868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4912943,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Carlos Calvo Tudela","firstName":"Jos\u00e9 Carlos Calvo","lastName":"Tudela","id":"37087947799"},{"name":"Julio Ortega Lopera","firstName":"Julio Ortega","lastName":"Lopera","id":"38010907800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3544-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1066-6192"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5750"}],"articleNumber":"4912943","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sequences","Amino acids","Protein engineering","Evolutionary computation","Space technology","Parallel processing","Diseases","Nuclear magnetic resonance","Computer architecture","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","evolutionary computation","parallel processing","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel protein structure prediction","multiobjective optimization","parallel processing","parallel multiobjective evolutionary"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiobjective Optimization","Parallelism","Protein Structure Prediction","PSP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912943","abstract":"The protein structure prediction (PSP) problem is considered an open problem as there is no recognized \"best\" procedure to find solutions.

However, the computational power of the mobile terminal is normally limited, compared with that of the stationary computing machine, because it has a number of constraints such as size, power, and cost. Since the mobile robot also has its inherent tasks, processing a large amount of data may cause other performance problems as the intelligence level grows. For this reason, it is not good practice to perform image processing via software programs, either in the mobile terminal or the in remote robot. This paper proposes a dedicated hardware architecture which can assist both the mobile terminal and the remote robot by taking complete charge of the vision-related tasks and thus decreasing the computational burden still to be performed. As a result, the remote robot can fully use its computation power for its main tasks so that the overall performance and efficiency can be increased.","doi":"10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4912990","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850396/4912969/04912990.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4912990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based image processing system for remote robot control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4912990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4912990/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based image processing system for remote robot control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10629100","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4912990/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based image processing system for remote robot control","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067418S","chronDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850396","isNumber":"4912969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850396","xplore-issue":"4912969","articleId":"4912990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4913000,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremy A.

Force-based assembly strategies offer a potential solution, although such methods are still poorly understood and can be difficult to program. In this paper, we describe a force-based robotic assembly approach that uses fixed strategies with tunable parameters. A generic assembly strategy suitable for execution on an industrial robot is selected by the programmer. Parameters are then self-tuned empirically by the robot using a genetic-algorithm learning process that seeks to minimize assembly time subject to contact-force limits. Results are presented for two automotive part assembly examples using ABB robots with commercial force-control software, showing that the approach is highly effective and suitable for industrial use.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913000/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10629110","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913000/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automated learning for parameter optimization of robotic assembly tasks utilizing genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated learning for parameter optimization of robotic assembly tasks utilizing genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Bangkok","sourcePdf":"0434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060096S","chronDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850396","isNumber":"4912969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850396","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4912969","articleId":"4913000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4913063,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Folgheraiter","affiliation":["German Research Center of Artificial Intelligence DFKI Bremen, Robotics Laboratory, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Folgheraiter","id":"37294171700"},{"name":"Bertold Bongardt","affiliation":["German Research Center of Artificial Intelligence DFKI Bremen, Robotics Laboratory, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bertold","lastName":"Bongardt","id":"37640072400"},{"name":"Jan Albiez","affiliation":["German Research Center of Artificial Intelligence DFKI Bremen, Robotics Laboratory, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Albiez","id":"37372373100"},{"name":"Frank Kirchner","affiliation":["German Research Center of Artificial Intelligence DFKI Bremen, Robotics Laboratory, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Kirchner","id":"37283559600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2678-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2679-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4913063","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":391},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Haptic interfaces","Humans","Kinematics","Exoskeletons","Virtual reality","Anatomy","Robots","Motion measurement","Anthropometry","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","control system synthesis","haptic interfaces","manipulator kinematics","telerobotics","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired haptic interface","telerobotics applications","virtual reality","human arm anatomy","multi contact-point haptic interface","arm mobility","simplified kinematic model","kinematic architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exoskeleton","Haptic Interface","Teleoperation","Bio-Inspired Device","Biorobotics"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design concept for a bio-inspired exoskeleton intended for applications in tele-robotics and virtual reality.

Our main goal is to develop a multi contact-point haptic interface that does not restrict the arm mobility and therefore increases the operational workspace. We propose a simplified kinematic model of the human arm using a notation coming from the robotics field. To figure out the best kinematic architecture we employed real movement data, measured from a human subject, and integrated them with the kinematic model of the exoskeleton. This allows us to test the system before its construction and to formalize specific requirements.

Results of simulation and experiments show that the proposed hysteresis model can exactly describe and predict the hysteresis of piezo actuator in comparison with traditional bilinear interpolation and has the better generalization ability.","doi":"10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913134","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850396/4912969/04913134.pdf","startPage":"988","endPage":"991","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hysteresis modeling of piezo actuator using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hysteresis modeling of piezo actuator using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10629228","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4913134/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hysteresis modeling of piezo actuator using neural networks","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037565S","chronDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850396","isNumber":"4912969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850396","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4912969","articleId":"4913134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4913168,"authors":[{"name":"Teerapat Chinapirom","affiliation":["System and Circuit Technology, Heinz Nixdorf Institute, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Teerapat","lastName":"Chinapirom","id":"37640535100"},{"name":"Ulf Witkowski","affiliation":["System and Circuit Technology, Heinz Nixdorf Institute, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulf","lastName":"Witkowski","id":"37267467100"},{"name":"Ulrich Ruckert","affiliation":["System and Circuit Technology, Heinz Nixdorf Institute, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Ruckert","id":"37267463400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2678-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2679-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4913168","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"abstract":"This paper describes a resource-efficient vision system for the mini-robot \u201cKhepera\u201d. It is implemented to perform a fundamental approach of robotic navigation, which is obstacle detection by using an optical flow algorithm. This is inspired by visual perception of insects. The optical flow field is evaluated by implementing the sum of absolute differences (SAD) operation of block matching while the mobile mini-robot moves on texture plane. The SAD is realized in an additional processing module based on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) solution which can perform various tasks in parallel; for example, image processing, camera control and symbolic protocol transmission to the mini-robot. As a result, the Khepera equipped with 2D camera and the additional module is able to autonomously move avoiding collisions with obstacles, called ego-motion. The 30 \u00d7 16 SAD operation is processed by computing 16 pairs of pixels in each operation, which accomplishes the real-time approach. The proposed implementation reduces processing time and power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850396/4912969/04913168.pdf","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1187","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","doi":"10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A biologically-inspired and resource-efficient vision system using mobile mini-robots for obstacle avoidance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Biomedical optical imaging","Image motion analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Cameras","Robots","Navigation","Visual perception","Insects","Image processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A biologically-inspired and resource-efficient vision system using mobile mini-robots for obstacle avoidance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913168/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A biologically-inspired and resource-efficient vision system using mobile mini-robots for obstacle avoidance","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051017S","chronDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850396","isNumber":"4912969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850396","xplore-issue":"4912969","articleId":"4913168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4913170,"authors":[{"name":"Dongkyun Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dongkyun Kim","id":"38560145900"},{"name":"Seunghun Jin","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seunghun Jin","id":"37290425800"},{"name":"Dung Duc Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dung Duc","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37634426900"},{"name":"Jae Wook Jeon","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Wook","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37295879900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2678-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2679-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4913170","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a simple binary shape matching algorithm and its hardware implementation. A shape matching algorithm is a method to measure the similarity of objects in an image. This technology is generally used in image retrieval, inspection, and object detection. The proposed method uses a transformation matrix that handles translation, rotation, and scaling. With a combined transformation matrix, we can easily obtain the transformed image and compare with this transform image and pattern image. After examination of the basic algorithm, we consider the hardware perspective. We analyze the difference between the software and hardware implementations and present revision factors for hardware implementation. Finally, we propose a dedicated hardware binary matching system. It is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) using the VHSIC hardware description language (VHD). The implementation is evaluated using experimental result and a device utilization summary.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850396/4912969/04913170.pdf","startPage":"1194","endPage":"1199","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","doi":"10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time binary shape matching system based on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Pattern matching","Hardware","Shape measurement","Inspection","Pattern recognition","Robots","Biomimetics","Image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time binary shape matching system","FPGA","image retrieval","inspection","object detection","transformation matrix","field programmable gate array","VHSIC hardware description language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shape Matching","FPGA","VHDL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Real-time binary shape matching system based on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913170/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10629263","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time binary shape matching system based on FPGA","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047484S","chronDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850396","isNumber":"4912969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850396","xplore-issue":"4912969","articleId":"4913170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4913212,"authors":[{"name":"Quy Ngoc Le","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Quy Ngoc","lastName":"Le","id":"38253698800"},{"name":"Jae Wook Jeon","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Wook","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37295879900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2678-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2679-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4913212","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"abstract":"This paper presents an improved speed damping algorithm.

This smooth estimated speed provides the ability to increase the sample rate of the control algorithm.

To reduce the numerous work and subjective uncertainty in manual adjustments, a novel immune particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm based on immune theory and nonlinear decreasing inertia weight (NDIW) strategy was proposed. Owing to the restraint factor and NDIW strategy, IPSO algorithm can effectively prevents premature convergence and keeps balance between global and local searching ability. Meanwhile, the algorithm maintains the ability of handling multimodal and multidimensional problems. IPSO algorithm has the fastest convergence velocity and finds the best solutions compared with GA, IGA, basic PSO algorithm etc. in simulation experiments. The experimental results on the AUV simulation platform show that IPSO-based controllers perform well and have strong abilities against current disturbance.

Meanwhile, a sliding mode control term is incorporated to further improve the robustness of the whole controller against external vibrations. In the presence of bounded vibrations, the uniformly ultimately boundedness of the filter error and the estimation errors of the RBFNN parameters can be guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory.

The path planning problem is formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem of searching a sequence of N ordered intermediate configurations between start and goal configurations over the group of all possible configurations that avoid collisions with obstacles while minimize the path length. We employ Pareto-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization using island parallel genetic algorithm (IPGA) with migration to tackle this problem. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the generated paths are statistically both shorter and smoother, up to third order geometric continuity, when compared to path planning by cubic spiral. In particular, the effect of N that represents path complexity on path planning performance of the evolutionary path planner based on IPGA is extensively tested on environments consisting of similar number of obstacles but different configurations.","doi":"10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913252","startPage":"1671","endPage":"1677","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850396/4912969/04913252.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-quality path planning for autonomous mobile robots with \u03b73-splines and parallel genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Mobile robots","Genetic algorithms","Spirals","Information science","Polynomials","Kinematics","Tracking","Acceleration","Wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","genetic algorithms","mobile robots","splines (mathematics)","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-quality path planning","autonomous mobile robots","parallel genetic algorithms","splines","wheeled mobile robots","path planning problem","collision avoidance","Pareto-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","multiobjective optimization","spline","path planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"High-quality path planning for autonomous mobile robots with \u03b73-splines and parallel genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913252/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10629339","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-quality path planning for autonomous mobile robots with \u03b73-splines and parallel genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070545S","chronDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850396","isNumber":"4912969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850396","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4912969","articleId":"4913252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4913255,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey V.

Five categories of human motion were done including walking, running, going upstairs, fall and standing. Fourier analysis was used to extract the feature from the human motion data. The concentrated information was finally used to categorize the human motions through HMM (hidden Markov model) process.

As a demonstration, we used this system on actual robots in RoboCup rescue league[1] and evaluated the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913282","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850396/4912969/04913282.pdf","startPage":"1844","endPage":"1849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible interface for multiple autonomous and teleoperated rescue robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Flexible interface for multiple autonomous and teleoperated rescue robots","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10629367","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913282/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913282/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible interface for multiple autonomous and teleoperated rescue robots","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032976S","chronDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850396","isNumber":"4912969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850396","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4912969","articleId":"4913282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4913288,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The MIPS navigates on the horizontal plane while balancing the pendulum. Control of the MIPS is difficult since the system is non-holonomic and nonlinear so that simple linear controllers may have poor performances for the system. The radial basis function(RBF) network is used as an auxiliary controller to help the primary PID controllers to perform better. The back propagation algorithm has been developed for the RBF function network. Real time control of the RBF network has been achieved by embedding the learning algorithm onto the DSP board. The performance of the RBF network controller has been tested for the remotely controlled MIPS by conducting experiments of climbing the slanted surface while balancing.","doi":"10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913296","startPage":"1932","endPage":"1937","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912969","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850396/4912969/04913296.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust control of a mobile inverted pendulum robot using a RBF neural network controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913296/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust control of a mobile inverted pendulum robot using a RBF neural network controller","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913296/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10629380","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust control of a mobile inverted pendulum robot using a RBF neural network controller","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057806S","chronDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850396","isNumber":"4912969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850396","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4912969","articleId":"4913296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4913297,"authors":[{"name":"Idris E.

Rotorcraft UAVs, in particular have more challenges than its fixed wing counterparts. More research and experiments have been conducted to study the stability and control of RUAVs. A model-based control system design is particularly of our interest since it avoids a tedious trial and error process. To be able to successfully stabilize and control the RUAVs therefore a sufficiently accurate model is necessary. There are many methods in modeling small-scale rotorcraft. Using a standard first-principle based modeling approach, considerable knowledge about rotorcraft flight dynamics is required to derive the governing equation. Another method is system identification from flight data. This paper presents a method for system identification using Neural Networks. Input-output data are provided from nonlinear simulation of X-Cell 60 small scale helicopter. The data is used to train the multi-layer perceptron combined with NNARXM time regression input vector to learn nonlinear behavior of the vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913297","startPage":"1938","endPage":"1943","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912969","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850396/4912969/04913297.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of unmanned small scale rotorcraft based on Neural Network identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913297/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling of unmanned small scale rotorcraft based on Neural Network identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913297/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10629381","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of unmanned small scale rotorcraft based on Neural Network identification","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061839S","chronDate":"22-25 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850396","isNumber":"4912969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850396","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4912969","articleId":"4913297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4913298,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It computes the transfer function via a fast procedure that calculates the voltage ratio between the receiver port and the transmitter port given a real or randomly generated network topology. The approach allows not only taking into account the cable characteristics, the number and length of branches, but also the effect of loads. In particular the effect of time-variant loads that cause the channel transfer function to be time-variant.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913395.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bottom-up transfer function generator for broadband PLC statistical channel modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transfer functions","Programmable control","Network topology","Computational modeling","Voltage","Transmission line matrix methods","Transmission line theory","Computer networks","Transmitters","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","carrier transmission on power lines","transfer functions","transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bottom-up transfer function generator","broadband PLC statistical channel modeling","transmission line theory","network topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power line communications","Channel modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bottom-up transfer function generator for broadband PLC statistical channel modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913395/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645411","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bottom-up transfer function generator for broadband PLC statistical channel modeling","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569170777.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057035S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4913396,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Galli","affiliation":["Panasonic Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Galli","id":"37269200100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3792-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4913396","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1039},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rayleigh channels","Communication systems","Transfer functions","Winches","Delay effects","Attenuation","Physics","Power transmission lines","Transmission line theory","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","mean square error methods","multipath channels","Rayleigh channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor power line channel","wireless channel","multipath propagation","Rayleigh distributed fading","multipath channels","root-mean-square delay spread","indoor channels","comparative analysis"]}],"abstract":"We report for the first time some statistical properties of the indoor power line (PL) channel that exhibit some interesting similarities to the wireless channel, although some fundamental differences are also pointed out. In particular, we argue here that, while multipath propagation in wireless channels gives rise to Rayleigh distributed fading, multipath in PL channels gives rise to log normally distributed fading similarly to shadow fading. We also report for the first time that both channel gain and Root-Mean-Square Delay Spread (RMS-DS) of indoor channels are log normally distributed, leptokurtic and negatively correlated, thus suggesting that channels that introduce severe multipath are also characterized by large attenuation. These results are used to define a simplified PL channel model useful for comparative analysis of communication schemes and, at the same time, to draw some general conclusions on the design of multicarrier schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913396","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913396.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","startPage":"13","endPage":"19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simplified model for the indoor power line channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simplified model for the indoor power line channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913396/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645412","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4913396/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplified model for the indoor power line channel","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569170977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073768S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4913397,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Tlich","affiliation":["INNOVAS, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Tlich","id":"37397692700"},{"name":"Hassina Chaouche","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, France Telecom, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Hassina","lastName":"Chaouche","id":"37640283700"},{"name":"Ahmed Zeddam","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, France Telecom, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Zeddam","id":"37281710800"},{"name":"Pascal Pagani","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, France Telecom, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Pagani","id":"37265768900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3792-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4913397","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":713},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Noise measurement","Noise generators","Home appliances","Electrical products","Interference","Switches","Distortion measurement","Modems","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","distortion","domestic appliances","impulse noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["powerline communications","impulsive noise model","receiver side model","signal distortions","data transmission","electrical appliances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Powerline communication","Impulsive Noise modelling","Electrical Appliances"]}],"abstract":"The electrical appliances shared with PLC modems in the same powerline network generate noises. Among them, impulsive noises are the main source of interference resulting in signal distortions and bit errors during data transmission. Many impulsive noise models were proposed in the literature. They share the same impulsive noise definition: ldquounpredictable noises measured at the receiver siderdquo. This definition leads to the modelling of thousands of impulsive noises whose plurality would very likely come from the diversity of paths that the original impulsive noise took. In this paper, an innovative modelling approach is applied to impulsive noises which are henceforth studied directly at their sources. Noise at the receiver is considered as the noise model at the source filtered by the powerline channel. Effective in-device sources of impulsive noises are identified and classified into six classes, from which representative noises are proposed. Based on impulsive modelling at source, a receiver side model is finally proposed.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913397","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913397.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel approach for PLC impulsive noise modelling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913397/","displayDocTitle":"Novel approach for PLC impulsive noise modelling","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913397/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10645413","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel approach for PLC impulsive noise modelling","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569173639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088754S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4913399,"authors":[{"name":"Anil Mengi","affiliation":["Institute of Experimental Mathematics, Duisburg Essen University, Essen, Germany"],"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Mengi","id":"37550028000"},{"name":"A.

Although many authors studied the performance of the OFDM systems under the impulsive noise, their considerations are mostly restricted to OFDM systems with a large number of subcarriers. In that case, discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spreads the impulsive noise in such a way that its distribution in the frequency domain can be approximated as Gaussian. If the number of subcarriers is small, these methods can be hardly used. We describe an iterative algorithm for correcting the impulsive noise errors for the OFDM transmission with a small number of subcarriers. Simulation results for a 16-OFDM-QPSK systems show that the influence of impulsive noise can be essentially reduced.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulsive noise error correction in 16-OFDM for narrowband power line communication","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913399","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913399.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Impulsive noise error correction in 16-OFDM for narrowband power line communication","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913399/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645415","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulsive noise error correction in 16-OFDM for narrowband power line communication","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569170475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098907S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4913401,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea M.

First, in case of power line transmission model without the circuit line, it was confirmed that the transmission loss characteristics inside a circuit breaker and through a main breaker are almost the same characteristics, but the transmission loss in the in-phase is smaller by about 10 dB than that in the out-of-phase. PHY rate of in-phase transmission is full PHY rate of about 185 Mbps, but PHY rate of out-of-phase transmission decreases to 150 Mbps. Next, in case of power line transmission model with the branch line, the transmission loss characteristic in the in-phase and the out-of-phase transmissions had sharp attenuation of about 20 dB at the frequency of around 4 MHz, because of the signal resonance in the branch line (10 m length). However, this sharp attenuation did not affect to PHY rate in the in-phase transmission, if anything, in the out-of-phase transmission, PHY rate was improved by the branch line. Finally, PHY rate of PLC modem was calculated by MATLAB/ Simulink, and compared with measurement value. It was understood that the calculation value almost agreed with the measurement one in the in-phase transmission.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913415.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM signal transmission characteristics through a switchboard for a power line communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Communication switching","Power line communications","Physical layer","Propagation losses","Mathematical model","Attenuation","Circuit breakers","Resonance","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM signal transmission characteristics","switchboard","power line communication","circuit breaker","main breaker","in-phase transmission","PHY rate","PLC modem","MATLAB","Simulink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Line Communication","OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)","A switchboard"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"OFDM signal transmission characteristics through a switchboard for a power line communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913415/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645431","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM signal transmission characteristics through a switchboard for a power line communication","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569170651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03628S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4913416,"authors":[{"name":"Mloyiswa P.

In this paper we investigate passive coupling circuits as an alternative to transformer-capacitor couplers, as the coupling transformer is a relatively expensive component. Various other sub-fields of PLC such as modulation and coding have received a lot of attention in recent years, whereas the sub-fields of coupling, filtering, impedance adaptation and protection have lagged behind. Most electronic circuits, especially filter circuits have been around for years and perhaps their design is sometimes viewed as exhausted. However, the nature of the power-line grid requires careful consideration, as sensitive modems are to be connected to the power-line network, via these coupling circuits. These couplers further have to withstand the strain of relatively large voltages and currents. Hence, sufficient time spent, designing and selecting coupling circuitry elements is essential to avoid unnecessary attenuation as well as possible damage to the more expensive communication circuitry.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913416","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913416.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive, transformerless coupling circuitry for narrow-band power-line communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913416/","displayDocTitle":"Passive, transformerless coupling circuitry for narrow-band power-line communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645432","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913416/","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive, transformerless coupling circuitry for narrow-band power-line communications","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569172589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057067S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4913420,"authors":[{"name":"Ronghong Mo","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Ronghong Mo","id":"37285561700"},{"name":"Ser Wah Oh","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ser Wah","lastName":"Oh","id":"37404798500"},{"name":"Yonghong Zeng","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yonghong Zeng","id":"37271453200"},{"name":"Suwandi R.

The least square (LS) technique together with the identified signal subspace are then used to derive the channel estimate in time domain using pilot OFDM symbols. The proposed estimators do not assume the knowledge of statistics of colored noise. The simulations show that, the proposed pilot-aided subspace tracking channel estimators outperform conventional LS based channel estimators, however, the performance gain is degraded with the increase of number of multipath.

Many studies show that, compared to the single carrier modulation scheme, the OFDM not only fights against the channel time dispersion, but also helps to mitigate the noxious effects of such kind of noise. The OFDM/OQAM is an alternative multicarrier scheme that exhibits a higher theoretical spectral efficiency than OFDM with cyclic prefix (CP-OFDM) and may furthermore, be well-localized in time and frequency. In this paper, an investigation of the OFDM/OQAM performance in impulsive environment is done. The influence of the prototype filter and the number of carriers on the bit error rate (BER) performance is analyzed. The results are compared to those obtained with the OFDM scheme.

Thus, OFDM has been adopted for high speed data transmission of multimedia traffic such as HomePlug A/V and Mobile WiMax. However, OFDM also has a drawback of a high PAPR (peak-to-average-power-ratio). This high PAPR takes place due to parallel processing of a number of data at once using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor. Due to this high PAPR amplifier usually does not act in dynamic range. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can reduce PAPR using selective mapping (SLM) in power line communication (PLC) channel. In order to utilize SLM technique, side information needs to be transmitted for demodulation while degrading transmission efficiency. We propose and analyze scaled SLM technique which removes necessity of the side information.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913423","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913423.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of scaled SLM for PAPR reduction of OFDM signal in PLC channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of scaled SLM for PAPR reduction of OFDM signal in PLC channels","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913423/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645439","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of scaled SLM for PAPR reduction of OFDM signal in PLC channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569172259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072693S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4913424,"authors":[{"name":"Taro Hayasaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Taro","lastName":"Hayasaki","id":"37640329200"},{"name":"Daisuke Umehara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Umehara","id":"37283471400"},{"name":"Satoshi Denno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Denno","id":"37279596500"},{"name":"Masahiro Morikura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Morikura","id":"37282342000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3792-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4913424","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power line communications","Programmable control","OFDM","Forward error correction","Bit error rate","Time division multiple access","Broadband communication","Fading","Bit rate","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","carrier transmission on power lines","error statistics","fading channels","forward error correction","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-loaded OFDMA","in-home power line communication","PLC","shortwave wireless system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency selective fading channel","forward error correction","FEC","bit error rate","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","multiple access scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power line communication","OFDM","OFDMA","bit loading algorithm","forward error correction"]}],"abstract":"The in-home broadband power line communication (PLC) is drawing attention to us lately. The broadband PLC has regulation issues for the coexistence with shortwave wireless systems. Therefore, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted for the broadband PLC. On the other hand, the power line channels suffer from frequency selective fading. It is effective to load appropriate bits on each subcarrier in the OFDM for PLC. In this paper, we propose a bit loading algorithm that maximizes the bit rate by optimizing not only the bit quantity on each subcarrier but also the whole code rate of the forward error correction (FEC) code subject to constraints on the total bit error rate (BER) and power on each subcarrier. Furthermore, we investigate orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) as a multiple access scheme on the in-home power line networks. We show that the proposed OFDMA scheme is superior to a time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme from the viewpoint of throughput by computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913424","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913424.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","startPage":"171","endPage":"176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bit-Loaded OFDMA for in-home power line communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A bit-Loaded OFDMA for in-home power line communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913424/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645440","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4913424/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bit-Loaded OFDMA for in-home power line communications","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569174386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085586S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4913425,"authors":[{"name":"Salvatore D'Alessandro","affiliation":["DIEGM, Universit\u00e0 di Udine, Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"D'Alessandro","id":"37392141500"},{"name":"Andrea M.

In this work, a novel phase based SNR estimation method for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems transmitting over the MVN is proposed. By exploiting the fact that under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions the phase errors at the receiver are normally distributed when the real SNR is over 10dB, the method estimates the SNR by only making use of the signal's phase samples. The knowledge of the current channel's transfer function as well as the current transmission power is not necessary for the SNR estimation, which simplifies the calculations and increases the method's applicability in practical systems communicating within the MVN environment. Immunity against constant phase errors and phase jitter caused by noise, the MVN channel or/and realistic OFDM synchronization count to further beneficial properties of the proposed estimator.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913427","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913427.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","startPage":"188","endPage":"193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase based SNR estimation in OFDM over the medium voltage network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase based SNR estimation in OFDM over the medium voltage network","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913427/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645443","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4913427/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase based SNR estimation in OFDM over the medium voltage network","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569170505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042649S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4913429,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Moreover, the transmission capacity analysis will lead us to find out who is the winner between these two systems for PLC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission capacity for indoor PLC: A comparison between DMT and HS-OQAM","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913435","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913435.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Transmission capacity for indoor PLC: A comparison between DMT and HS-OQAM","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913435/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645451","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission capacity for indoor PLC: A comparison between DMT and HS-OQAM","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569172181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055791S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4913437,"authors":[{"name":"Nikoleta Andreadou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Telecommunications Division, Panepistimioupolis of Thessaloniki, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikoleta","lastName":"Andreadou","id":"37396539100"},{"name":"Fotini-Niovi Pavlidou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Telecommunications Division, Panepistimioupolis of Thessaloniki, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Fotini-Niovi","lastName":"Pavlidou","id":"37271709500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3792-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4913437","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913437","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power line communications","Parity check codes","Iterative algorithms","Iterative decoding","System performance","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Background noise","Power system modeling","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","carrier transmission on power lines","channel coding","cyclic codes","error statistics","impulse noise","iterative decoding","OFDM modulation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power line communication channel","QC-LDPC codes","low density parity check codes","iterative belief propagation decoding algorithm","bit flipping algorithm","quasi cyclic form","bit error rate","SNR","Middleton class A noise model","impulsive noise","Zimmermann channel model","OFDM transmission technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Line Communications (PLC)","Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes","decoding algorithms"]}],"abstract":"In this paper Low Density Parity Check Codes (LDPC) are introduced in the Power Line Communications Channel (PLC). We investigate how different decoding algorithms, which are applied on LDPC codes, affect the system's performance. Therefore, an iterative belief propagation decoding algorithm as well as a proposed variation of the original bit flipping algorithm are exploited. In addition, a hybrid technique combining these two algorithms is proposed. Irregular LDPC codes of various code rates are studied. Specifically, the cases of 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 3/4 and 4/5 code rates are investigated. Regarding the irregular LDPC codes, they are constructed in a Quasi-Cyclic form. The system's performance is expressed in terms of the resultant Bit Error Rate (BER) versus the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In order to design the power line communications channel, Middleton's class A noise model is used to account for the system's background and impulsive noise, while Zimmermann's channel model is also used. The OFDM transmission technique is taken into account. Results are derived via computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913437","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913437.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QC-LDPC codes and their performance on Power Line Communications Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"QC-LDPC codes and their performance on Power Line Communications Channel","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645453","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913437/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QC-LDPC codes and their performance on Power Line Communications Channel","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569173449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060354S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4913438,"authors":[{"name":"Kyong-Hoe Kim","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyong-Hoe","lastName":"Kim","id":"37634599600"},{"name":"Han-Byul Lee","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Han-Byul Lee","id":"37538535700"},{"name":"Yong-Hwa Kim","affiliation":["Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Ansan, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong-Hwa Kim","id":"37311197900"},{"name":"Seong-Cheol Kim","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Cheol","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291921400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3792-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4913438","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":268},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise robustness","Broadband communication","Power line communications","Programmable control","Communications technology","Power supplies","Streaming media","IP networks","Phase noise","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","synchronisation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband power line communications","time-varying powerline channel","noise synchronization","electrical power supply networks","video streaming","audio streaming","broadband Internet access","channel adaptation scheme","cyclic variation","AC cycle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel adaptation","channel measurement","LPTV","powerline communication"]}],"abstract":"Broadband power line communications (PLC) technology allows the usage of electrical power supply networks for communications purposes, such as audio/video streaming and broadband Internet access.

The Advanced Metering Infrastructure is a simple example of such a system where all the meters on a certain grid must be able to provide the necessary information to the master head end within a very short duration (fraction of a second for real time load control). Wireless solutions for the smart grid systems have been implemented, but cannot access all grid locations, especially enclosed ones. In this paper, we present an interactive, OFDMA based communication system optimized for operation over the low voltage power lines in the CENELEC bands A and B. A channel model representing statistical time-varying, and frequency selective powergrid channels and noise is presented. Using this model, an OFDMA based transceiver is developed that is capable of providing smart grid like access capacity to the head end connected to multiple meters. The transceiver is optimized based on the channel model and the characteristics derived from the structure of the grid.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913442.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"279","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data communication over the smart grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data communication","Smart grids","Power system modeling","Transceivers","Intelligent sensors","Sensor systems","Real time systems","Load flow control","Low voltage","Time varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","data communication","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","power grids","time-varying channels","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","smart grid","OFDMA based communication","low voltage power lines","channel model","statistical time-varying channel","frequency selective powergrid channel","transceiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart grid","channel modelling","OFDMA","sub-band allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4913442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Data communication over the smart grid","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4913442/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645458","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data communication over the smart grid","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569169973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0657S","chronDate":"March 29 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907388","isNumber":"4913386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907388","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4913386","articleId":"4913442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4913444,"authors":[{"name":"Meryem Ouzzif","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Meryem","lastName":"Ouzzif","id":"37319644500"},{"name":"Jerome Le Masson","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Le Masson","id":"37319647300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3792-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4913444","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4913444","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical analysis","Programmable control","Throughput","Power line communications","OFDM modulation","Intersymbol interference","Delay","Time domain analysis","Frequency measurement","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","channel capacity","indoor communication","OFDM modulation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical analysis","cyclic prefix length","multicarrier modulation","indoor PLC capacity","power line communication","channel impulse response","Orange Labs","OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor power line communications (PLC)","Cyclic Prefix (CP) length","statistical analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913444","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907388/4913386/04913444.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2009.4913444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4913386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical analysis of the Cyclic Prefix impact on indoor PLC capacity","abstract":"This paper aims at presenting the impact of the cyclic prefix (CP) length on the maximal achievable throughput for multicarrier modulations used in power line communications (PLC).

Especially, this paper points out how the same terms are explained and understood in a variety of meanings, and in very many cases are misinterpreted and misunderstood. Both terms, MTBF and MTTF are used as an attribute or measure of hardware and software reliability, and also as essential information in logistics for planning of the spare parts for the repairable items, or planning of the replacement or non repairable items, warranties, planning for part obsolescence, and such. It is a very frequent practice that MTTF is understood to be the universal attribute of a non-repairable item, and in the gross simplification it is often assumed to be the indicator of the expected life of that item. In a multitude of occasions, it is used interchangeably with the MTBF, and with no mention of how this value was derived, for what circumstances, for what stresses, or its application. The values are advertized, and the goodness of the product is judged by the advertized values. This paper does not focus on the correct use of both measures (MTTF and MTTF). It merely discusses the often inaccurate applications and often gross misinterpretation of those terms. In particular, this paper discusses their actual meaning, the dependency of their values on use of the items within products or by themselves, the meaning or the lack of it for various products of current technology, and the misguide they can provide if used for maintenance or repair planning. The paper emphasizes that one item does not have and cannot have one MTBF or MTTF, but those, if calculated, averaged, estimated, are entirely and widely dependent on the application stresses, their use profile within a system, the period of their use, the construction of the products, their sensitivity to the stress changes etc. Only physically correct mathematical representation may be able to decide usefulness and reliability of items, dependent on their application and the needs of the products where they are used. Also, the MTBF is a measure of failure frequency thus is dependent for the major part on the MTTF of the least reliable part in that item. The paper also explains the meaning of the reliability test results related to the MTBF or MTTF of an item and to the reliability of its components.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMS.2009.4914702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4914625","startPage":"353","endPage":"359","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906862/4914625/04914702.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to estimate and use MTTF/MTBF would the real MTBF please stand up?","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4914702/","displayDocTitle":"How to estimate and use MTTF/MTBF would the real MTBF please stand up?","conferenceDate":"26-29 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10645780","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to estimate and use MTTF/MTBF would the real MTBF please stand up?","confLoc":"Fort Worth, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"12C-2.2009RM0049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068857S","chronDate":"26-29 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906862","isNumber":"4914625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906862","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4914625","articleId":"4914702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4914720,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Tian","affiliation":["Concordia Institute of Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Zhigang Tian is currently an Assistant Professor in Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering at Concordia University, Canada.

However, maximizing their potential value in terms of system security and scheduling is a considerable challenge because of their widely varying and potentially complex operational characteristics. This paper investigates the use of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) to schedule a significant number of varied interruptible loads over 16 h. The scheduling objective is to achieve a system requirement of total hourly curtailments while satisfying the operational constraints of the available interruptible loads, minimizing the total payment to them and minimizing the frequency of interruptions imposed upon them. This multiobjective optimization problem was simplified by using a single aggregate objective function. The BPSO algorithm proved capable of achieving near-optimal solutions in manageable computational time-frames for this relatively complex, nonlinear and noncontinuous problem. The effectiveness of the approach was further improved by dividing the swarm into several subswarms. The proposed scheduling technique demonstrated useful performance for a relatively challenging scheduling task, and would seem to offer some potential advantages in scheduling significant numbers of widely varied and technically complex interruptible loads.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5170200/04914742.pdf","startPage":"1173","endPage":"1181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling of Demand Side Resources Using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2021219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2021219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4914742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914742/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling of Demand Side Resources Using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793402","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4914742/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling of Demand Side Resources Using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs03-mpedrasa-2021219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062134S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5170200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"210","xplore-issue":"5170200","articleId":"4914742","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4914745,"authors":[{"name":"Im Y.

A standard waveguide measurement setup is used to evaluate the performance of the design. The proposed FSS consists of two periodic arrays of metallic loops, with the same periodicity, on either side of a very thin dielectric substrate. The tuning of the reconfigurable surface is shown numerically to be possible by incorporating tuning varactors into the structure. Using varactors on both layers, a reconfigurable frequency response is achieved, which has two modes of operation: bandstop and bandpass. In addition to two completely different modes of operation, the center frequency, as well as the bandwidth of the response can be tuned independently. Frequency tunability with a constant bandwidth over 3-3.5 GHz is shown. A bandwidth tuning at a fixed center frequency is also demonstrated. Simulation results are verified experimentally by fabricating prototypes of the design at \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</i>\n-band loaded with lumped capacitors.

Using only a finite set of waveforms for model training, our technique enables the trained model to respond accurately to test waveforms of unknown shapes. To relate information of training waveforms with that of test waveforms, we exploit an internal space of a recurrent neural network, called the internal input-neuron space. We formulate a new circuit block combining a generic load and a generic excitation to terminate the circuit. By sweeping the coefficients of the proposed circuit block, we obtain a rich combination of training waveforms to cover the region of interest in the internal input-neuron space effectively. We also present a new method to reduce the amount of training data while maintaining the necessary modeling information. The proposed method is demonstrated through examples of recurrent neural-network modeling of high-speed drivers and an RF amplifier. It is confirmed that, for different terminations and test waveforms, the model trained with the proposed technique has better accuracy and robustness than that using the existing training methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2020832","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5071758/04914758.pdf","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1553","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2020832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Training Approach for Robust Recurrent Neural-Network Modeling of Nonlinear Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Training Approach for Robust Recurrent Neural-Network Modeling of Nonlinear Circuits","volume":"57","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10728490","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4914758/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Training Approach for Robust Recurrent Neural-Network Modeling of Nonlinear Circuits","sourcePdf":"57tmtt06-qzhang-2020832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093473S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5071758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5071758","articleId":"4914758","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":4914765,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Schacherer","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Physics, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schacherer","id":"37313621900"},{"name":"James Langston","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Power Systems, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Langston","id":"37413610900"},{"name":"Michael Steurer","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Power Systems, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Steurer","id":"37274946000"},{"name":"Mathias Noe","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Physics, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Mathias","lastName":"Noe","id":"37269107100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"4914765","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"abstract":"In recent years, good progress has been made in improving the quality and quantity afforded by the manufacturing process for YBCO coated conductors. As a result, several programs have started to develop electrical power applications like motors, transformers, and fault current limiters (SCFCL) with these conductors. High voltage resistive type SCFCLs may typically be assembled from modules connected in series and parallel to accommodate the required voltage and current levels. The limited length of such a SCFCL module simplifies the configuration, manufacturing, and maintenance. It also allows testing of these modules under laboratory conditions at reduced power levels. In order to test SCFCL modules under conditions they will experience in high voltage electrical networks, advanced test methods such as power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) can offer significant advantages. This method allows studying conditions such as voltage stability and severe system perturbations with the actual SCFCL module in the loop. Hence, the quench and recovery behavior of the SCFCL module can be investigated under conditions characteristic of real electrical power networks without elaborate experimental setups. This paper presents results from PHIL experiments with a SCFCL module consisting of an approx. 10 m coated conductor.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/5166701/04914765.pdf","startPage":"1801","endPage":"1805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2009.2018048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2009.2018048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4914765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing of a YBCO Coated Conductor Fault Current Limiting Module","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Yttrium barium copper oxide","Conductors","Fault currents","Voltage","Manufacturing processes","Transformers","Fault current limiters","Assembly","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["barium compounds","copper compounds","fault current limiters","superconducting devices","yttrium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power hardware-in-the-loop testing","coated conductor fault current limiting module","motors","transformers","fault current limiters","SCFCL","voltage stability","severe system perturbations","electrical power networks","YBCO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power-hardware-in-the-loop","superconducting fault current limiter","test method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Power Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing of a YBCO Coated Conductor Fault Current Limiting Module","volume":"19","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4914765/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10781783","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing of a YBCO Coated Conductor Fault Current Limiting Module","sourcePdf":"tasc-schacherer-2018048.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049874S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"5166701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5166701","articleId":"4914765","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4914780,"authors":[{"name":"Murtaza A.

The goal is to obtain a rate-control policy that minimizes the total transmission energy expenditure while ensuring that the QoS constraints are met. Using a novel formulation based on cumulative curves methodology, we obtain the optimal transmission policy and show that it has a simple and appealing graphical visualization.

The current standard is the wavelet-domain natural image statistics model (WNISM), which applies the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the marginal distributions of wavelet coefficients of the reference and distorted images to measure the image distortion. However, WNISM fails to consider the statistical correlations of wavelet coefficients in different subbands and the visual response characteristics of the mammalian cortical simple cells. In addition, wavelet transforms are optimal greedy approximations to extract singularity structures, so they fail to explicitly extract the image geometric information, e.g., lines and curves. Finally, wavelet coefficients are dense for smooth image edge contours. In this paper, to target the aforementioned problems in IQA, we develop a novel framework for IQA to mimic the human visual system (HVS) by incorporating the merits from multiscale geometric analysis (MGA), contrast sensitivity function (CSF), and the Weber's law of just noticeable difference (JND). In the proposed framework, MGA is utilized to decompose images and then extract features to mimic the multichannel structure of HVS. Additionally, MGA offers a series of transforms including wavelet, curvelet, bandelet, contourlet, wavelet-based contourlet transform (WBCT), and hybrid wavelets and directional filter banks (HWD), and different transforms capture different types of image geometric information. CSF is applied to weight coefficients obtained by MGA to simulate the appearance of images to observers by taking into account many of the nonlinearities inherent in HVS. JND is finally introduced to produce a noticeable variation in sensory experience. Thorough empirical studies are carried out upon the LIVE database against subjective mean opinion score (MOS) and demonstrate that 1) the proposed framework has good consistency with subjective perception values and the objective assessment results can well reflect the visual quality of images, 2) different transforms in MGA under the new framework perform better than the standard WNISM and some of them even perform better than the standard full-reference IQA model, i.e., the mean structural similarity index, and 3) HWD performs best among all transforms in MGA under the framework.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2018014","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5073253/04914782.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2018014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073253","startPage":"1409","endPage":"1423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Quality Assessment Based on Multiscale Geometric Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4914782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image Quality Assessment Based on Multiscale Geometric Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10704731","pubMedId":"19447715","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4914782/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Quality Assessment Based on Multiscale Geometric Analysis","sourcePdf":"18tip06-xli-2018014.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130828S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5073253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"5073253","articleId":"4914782","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4914784,"authors":[{"name":"Priyam Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5073253/4914784/4914784-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Priyam Chatterjee (S'07) received the B.Tech. degree in information technology from the University of Kalyani, India, and the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

These weights are exceedingly informative and robust in conveying reliable local structural information about the image even in the presence of significant amounts of noise. Next, we model each region (or cluster)-which may not be spatially contiguous-by ldquolearningrdquo a best basis describing the patches within that cluster using principal components analysis. This learned basis (or ldquodictionaryrdquo) is then employed to optimally estimate the underlying pixel values using a kernel regression framework. An iterated version of the proposed algorithm is also presented which leads to further performance enhancements. We also introduce a novel mechanism for optimally choosing the local patch size for each cluster using Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE). We illustrate the overall algorithm's capabilities with several examples. These indicate that the proposed method appears to be competitive with some of the most recently published state of the art denoising methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2018575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5073253/04914784.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2018575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5073253","startPage":"1438","endPage":"1451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering-Based Denoising With Locally Learned Dictionaries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4914784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clustering-Based Denoising With Locally Learned Dictionaries","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914784/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10704730","pubMedId":"19447711","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4914784/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering-Based Denoising With Locally Learned Dictionaries","sourcePdf":"18tip06-pchatterjee-2018575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133834S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5073253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"5073253","articleId":"4914784","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4914791,"authors":[{"name":"Justin A.

Its seamless communication capabilities arise by the supported handover scheme that relies on a novel Moving Extended Cell (MEC) concept. MEC exploits user-centric virtual groups of adjacent cells that transmit the same data content to the user and utilizes a switch mechanism for restructuring the virtual multi-cell area according to the user's mobility pattern, so that a virtual antenna group moves together with the mobile user. We present the theoretical formulation for MEC and show that it can provide zero packet loss and call dropping probability values in high-rate wireless services for a broad range of mobile speeds up to 40 m/sec, independently of the fiber link distances. We also demonstrate the physical layer network architecture and switch mechanism both for a RoF network with a single 60 GHz radio frequency (RF) over each wavelength, as well as for a RoF configuration supporting simultaneous multi-RF channel transmission over each optical wavelength. The performance of the multi-RF-over-lambda network implementation is evaluated via simulations showing successful 100 Mb/s radio signal transmission over fiber links longer than 30 km. To this end, MEC can enable seamless connectivity and bandwidth guarantees in 60 GHz picocellular RoF networks being also capable of serving multiple users over the same wavelength in a RF frequency-division-multiplexed (FDM) approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June15, 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10702511","htmlLink":"/document/4914798/","displayDocTitle":"A 60 GHz Radio-Over-Fiber Network Architecture for Seamless Communication With High Mobility","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60 GHz Radio-Over-Fiber Network Architecture for Seamless Communication With High Mobility","sourcePdf":"jlt-npleros-2022505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125944S","chronDate":"June15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5067409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5067409","articleId":"4914798","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4914799,"authors":[{"name":"Matan Protter","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Matan","lastName":"Protter","id":"37401841600"},{"name":"Michael Elad","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Elad","id":"37283273600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"4914799","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1154},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Image resolution","Image reconstruction","Solid modeling","Noise measurement","Gaussian noise","Robustness","Additive noise","Noise generators","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image resolution","motion estimation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["super-resolution reconstruction","SRR formulation","probabilistic motion estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deinterlacing","probabilistic motion estimation","super resolution"]}],"abstract":"Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) has long been relying on very accurate motion estimation between the frames for a successful process.

First, the suggested approach is much simpler and more intuitive, relying on the classic SRR formulation, and using a probabilistic and crude motion estimation.

The light path follows the microfluidic channels, an architecture that can maximize detection efficiency and make the most economic use of chip area in many lab-on-chip applications. The PDMS-based microfluidic channels are coated with Teflon amorphous fluoropolymers (Teflon AF) which has a lower refractive index (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n = 1.31) than water (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n = 1.33) to form a water/Teflon AF optical waveguide. Driven by a vacuum pump, the Teflon AF solution was flowed through the channels, leaving a thin (5-15 mum) layer of coating on the channel wall as the cladding layer of optical waveguides. This coating process resolves the limitations of spin-coating processes by reducing the elasticity mismatch between the Teflon AF cladding layer and the PDMS device body. We demonstrate that the resulting optofluidic waveguide confines and guides the laser light through the liquid core channel. Furthermore, the light in such a waveguide can be split when the fluid flow is split. This new method enables highly integrated biosensors such as lab-on-chip flow cytometers and micro-fabricated fluorescence-activated cell sorter with on-chip excitation.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2009.2022276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/5161434/04914805.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2009.2022276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161434","startPage":"1057","endPage":"1059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optofluidic Waveguides in Teflon AF-Coated PDMS Microfluidic Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4914805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optofluidic Waveguides in Teflon AF-Coated PDMS Microfluidic Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.1,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914805/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"15","publicationDate":"Aug.1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10779026","pubMedId":"20729984","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4914805/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optofluidic Waveguides in Teflon AF-Coated PDMS Microfluidic Channels","sourcePdf":"lpt-scho-2022276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07155S","chronDate":"Aug.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"5161434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5161434","articleId":"4914805","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4914807,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5175618/4914807/4914807-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoou Tang (S'93\u2013M'96\u2013SM'02\u2013F'09) received the B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 1990, the M.S. degree from the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, in 1991, and the Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 1996.","He is a Professor with the Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

The major advantage of the video-based method is that more information is available in a video sequence than in a single image. In order to take advantage of the large amount of information in the video sequence and at the same time overcome the processing speed and data size problems, we develop several new techniques including temporal and spatial frame synchronization, multilevel discriminant subspace analysis, and multiclassifier integration for video sequence processing. An aligned video sequence for each person is first obtained by applying temporal and spatial synchronization, which effectively establishes the face correspondence using both audio and video information; then multilevel discriminant subspace analysis or multiclassifier integration is employed for further analysis based on the synchronized sequence. The method preserves most of the temporal-spatial information contained in a video sequence.

Filters","abstract":"A novel adaptive interpolation filter structure for video coding with motion-compensated prediction is presented in this letter. The proposed scheme uses an independent directional adaptive interpolation filter for each sub-pixel location. The Wiener interpolation filter coefficients are computed analytically for each inter-coded frame at the encoder side and transmitted to the decoder. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to 1.1 dB coding gain and a 15% average bit-rate reduction for high-resolution video materials compared to the standard nonadaptive interpolation scheme of H.264/AVC, while requiring 36% fewer arithmetic operations for interpolation. The proposed interpolation can be implemented in exactly 16-bit arithmetic, thus it can have important use-cases in mobile multimedia environments where the computational resources are severely constrained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4914821/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828271","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Video Coding With Low-Complexity Directional Adaptive Interpolation Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Coding With Low-Complexity Directional Adaptive Interpolation Filters","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-drusanovskyy-2022708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049833S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5208486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5208486","articleId":"4914821","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4914823,"authors":[{"name":"Jyu-Yuan Lai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyu-Yuan","lastName":"Lai","id":"37400731800"},{"name":"Chih-Tsun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Tsun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281272400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4914823","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":949},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elliptic curve cryptography","CMOS technology","CMOS process","Coordinate measuring machines","Semiconductor device measurement","Performance evaluation","Hardware","Scalability","Cost function","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","microprocessor chips","power consumption","public key cryptography","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-throughput dual-field elliptic-curve-cryptography processor","CMOS technology","processor core size","coordinate conversion","binary field","prime field","ECC processor chip","power consumption","public-key cryptography","very large scale integration","cipher processor","size 0.13 mum","size 1.44 mm","frequency 121 MHz","power 70.0 mW","time 608 mus","time 372 mus","frequency 146 MHz","power 82.1 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Binary field","dual field","elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)","prime field","public-key cryptography","very large scale integration (VLSI) hardware implementation"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents a high-throughput dual-field elliptic-curve-cryptography (ECC) processor that features all ECC functions with the programmable field and curve parameters over both the prime and binary fields.

By capturing the latest degradation state of the component being monitored, the updating process provides a more accurate of the remaining life. With the aid of a stopping rule, maintenance routines are scheduled based on the most recently updated RLD.

Remote diagnosis can be realized using a communication network. We have developed a master-slave type remote medical system to diagnose shoulder diseases, such as dialysis-related amyloid arthropathy (DRAA), by ultrasonographic images. Proper positioning, orientation, and contact force between the ultrasound probe and the affected area of the patient are required in order to acquire proper diagnostic images. Safety and manipulability are also required when operating the remote medical system through a communication network. Therefore, the system has impedance control capability for positioning of the master and slave manipulators in order to convey the contact force and enhance manipulability. In addition, the system has continuous-path control capability for the orientation of the slave manipulator in order to realize smooth and accurate motion of the ultrasound probe, even if the sampling rate of the transmission of the orientation data of the master manipulator is not sufficient. The results of remote diagnostic experiments demonstrated that a healthcare professional could diagnose real patients through a communication network using the constructed system.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2009.2019785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5068831/04914837.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2009.2019785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068831","startPage":"522","endPage":"538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction Methodology for a Remote Ultrasound Diagnostic System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4914837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Construction Methodology for a Remote Ultrasound Diagnostic System","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914837/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10713515","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4914837/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction Methodology for a Remote Ultrasound Diagnostic System","sourcePdf":"tro-koizumi-2019785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131448S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5068831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5068831","articleId":"4914837","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4914843,"authors":[{"name":"Inaki Iturrate","affiliation":["Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n en Ingenier\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n and the Departamento de Inform\u00e1tica e Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/5068831/4914843/4914843-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["I\u00f1aki Iturrate (S'09) received the M.S. degree in computer science from the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, in 2008, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in brain\u2013computer interfaces at the Robotics, Perception, and Real Time Group.","He has been engaged in research on brain\u2013computer interfaces and was responsible for the software engineering tasks in the development of a brain-actuated wheelchair.

This location is transferred to the autonomous navigation system that drives the wheelchair to the desired location while avoiding collisions with obstacles in the environment detected by the laser scanner. This concept gives the user the flexibility to use the device in unknown and evolving scenarios. The prototype was validated with five healthy participants in three consecutive steps: screening (an analysis of three different groups of visual interface designs), virtual-environment driving, and driving sessions with the wheelchair. On the basis of the results, this paper reports the following evaluation studies: 1) a technical evaluation of the device and all functionalities; 2) a users' behavior study; and 3) a variability study.

The new filter design generalizes traditional filter realizations based on directly replacing the theoretical covariance matrix by its sample estimate, and being consistent when all dimensions in the model but the number of samples remain bounded. Our solution not only generalizes the conventional estimator, but also turns out to appropriately characterize model mismatch constraints due to finite sample-size limitations of fundamental importance in practical situations. The proposed implementation results from a generalized consistent estimation of the set of MMSE filter subspace coefficients on the reduced-dimensional subspace. Results are based on the theory of the spectral analysis of large-dimensional random matrices. In particular, we build on the analytical description of the asymptotic spectrum of sample-covariance-type matrices in the limiting regime defined as both the number of samples and the observation dimension grow without bound at the same rate. As a result, the proposed MMSE signal waveform estimator is shown to present a superior mean-square error performance under a finite sample-size by avoiding the breakdown experienced as the selected rank increases. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914845/","volume":"57","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764089","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Consistent Reduced-Rank LMMSE Estimation With a Limited Number of Samples per Observation Dimension","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistent Reduced-Rank LMMSE Estimation With a Limited Number of Samples per Observation Dimension","sourcePdf":"57tsp08-frubio-2021500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058541S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","isNumber":"5165248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4914845","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4914849,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Martins","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5235161/4914849/4914849-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ricardo Martins received the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), Universidade T\u00e9cnica de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal, in 2007.","He was a Researcher of the Image Group at IST, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, as part of the European Project VISNET II, a network of excellence.

Contrary to available prediction-based standard video codecs, WZ video coding exploits the source statistics at the decoder, allowing the development of simpler encoders. Until now, WZ video coding did not reach the compression efficiency performance of conventional video coding solutions, mainly due to the poor quality of the side information, which is an estimate of the original frame created at the decoder in the most popular WZ video codecs. In this context, this paper proposes a novel side information refinement (SIR) algorithm for a transform domain WZ video codec based on a learning approach where the side information is successively improved as the decoding proceeds. The results show significant and consistent performance improvements regarding state-of-the-art WZ and standard video codecs, especially under critical conditions such as high motion content and long group of pictures sizes.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2022783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5235161/04914849.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2022783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235161","startPage":"1327","endPage":"1341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refining Side Information for Improved Transform Domain Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4914849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Refining Side Information for Improved Transform Domain Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914849/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10864320","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4914849/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Refining Side Information for Improved Transform Domain Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-rmartins-2022783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105342S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5235161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5235161","articleId":"4914849","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4914850,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Xiang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Surveying, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, QLD, Australia","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5344167/4914850/4914850-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Xiang (S'00\u2013M'04) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees, both in electronic engineering, from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering from the University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia, in 2004.","Since January 2004, he has been with the Faculty of Engineering and Surveying, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia, where he was first an Associate Lecturer in Computer Systems Engineering from 2004 to 2006, then a Lecturer from 2007 to 2008, and currently holds a faculty post of Senior Lecturer.

The proposed 2DL-MDC scheme allocates multiple description sub-bitstreams of a 2-D scalable bitstream to two network paths with unequal loss rates. We formulate the 2-D scalable rate-distortion problem and derive the expected distortion for the proposed scheme. To minimize the end-to-end distortion given the total rate budget and packet loss probabilities, we need to optimally allocate source and channel rates for each hierarchical sublayer of the scalable bitstream. The conventional Lagrangian multiplier method can be utilized to solve this problem but with overwhelming computational complexity. Therefore, we consider the use of the genetic algorithm to solve the rate-distortion optimization problem. The simulation results verify that the proposed method is able to achieve significant performance gain as opposed to the conventional equal rate allocation method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2022787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5344167","startPage":"1730","endPage":"1738","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5344167/04914850.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward Error Correction-Based 2-D Layered Multiple Description Coding for Error-Resilient H.264 SVC Video Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4914850/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Forward Error Correction-Based 2-D Layered Multiple Description Coding for Error-Resilient H.264 SVC Video Transmission","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11005215","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward Error Correction-Based 2-D Layered Multiple Description Coding for Error-Resilient H.264 SVC Video Transmission","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-wxiang-2022787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087627S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5344167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5344167","articleId":"4914850","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4914853,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Lian Lin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5208445/4914853/4914853-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Lian Lin received the B.S. degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan, in 2006, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan in 2008.","His recent research interests include optical systems design, microoptoelectromechanical system, and signal processing."]},"firstName":"Wei-Lian","lastName":"Lin","id":"37632726700"},{"name":"Tsung-Chih Yu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5208445/4914853/4914853-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Chih Yu received the B.S. degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2002, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2004, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree."]},"firstName":"Tsung-Chih","lastName":"Yu","id":"37290331400"},{"name":"Yu-Lung Lo","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5208445/4914853/4914853-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Lung Lo received the B.S. degree from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1985, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from the Smart Materials and Structures Research Center, University of Maryland, College Park, in 1992 and 1995, respectively.","After graduation, he joined the Opto-Electronics and Systems Laboratories of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), working on fiber optic smart structures and fiber communications.

In the proposed approach, the Stokes parameters are measured for linearly polarized probe lights with polarization angles of 0deg and 45deg, respectively, with the azimuth angle of the test cell set to 0deg. The TNLC is then rotated through 45deg and the Stokes parameters are remeasured. The four sets of Stokes parameters are processed by GA for the data fitting to inversely derive the cell parameters, and especially the pretilt angle is successfully obtained with slight tilt of the cell. Also, the proposed method enables the four parameters of the TNLC cell to be measured over the full azimuth angle range and involves a single wavelength only. Unlike existing methods that need continuously rotating the polarizer for achieving a curve fitting in Stokes parameters or using multiple wavelengths, this technique first proposed in this study supplies a simpler and cheaper methodology to extract the four parameters of TNLC cell.

The log-normal and gamma-gamma irradiance probability density function models have been considered to include the effects of optical turbulence. An expression for the mean intensity under pointing fluctuations is derived. Results for ergodic and outage channel capacities are presented.

Although, in general, turbulence degrades communications link performance, it can reduce sensitivity to pointing errors by increasing the effective beam radius.

It consists in detecting the presence of a given template in a digital image. This task becomes considerably more complex with the invariance to rotation, scale, translation, brightness and contrast (RSTBC). A novel RSTBC-invariant robust template matching algorithm named Ciratefi was recently proposed. However, its execution in a conventional computer takes several seconds. Moreover, the implementation of its general version in hardware is difficult, because there are many adjustable parameters. This paper proposes a software that automatically generates compilable Hardware Description Logic (VHDL) modules that implements Ciratefi in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices. The proposed solution accelerates the time to process a frame from 7s (in a 3 GHz PC) to 1.06 ms. This excellent performance (more than the required for a real-time system) may lead to cost-effective high-performance co-processing computer vision systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4914881/4914882/04914890.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"26","publicationTitle":"2009 5th Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","doi":"10.1109/SPL.2009.4914890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPL.2009.4914890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4914882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4914890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic VHDL generation for solving rotation and scale-invariant template matching in FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer vision","Hardware","Programmable logic arrays","Digital images","Brightness","Robustness","Automatic logic units","Logic devices","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic VHDL generation","rotation template matching","scale-invariant template matching","FPGA","computer vision","digital image","Ciratefi","hardware description logic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automatic VHDL generation for solving rotation and scale-invariant template matching in FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4914890/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646224","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic VHDL generation for solving rotation and scale-invariant template matching in FPGA","confLoc":"Sao Carlos, Brazil","sourcePdf":"Paper_23_-_Automatic_VHDL_generation_for_solving.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070375S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4914881","isNumber":"4914882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4914881","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4914882","articleId":"4914890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4914893,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Sbeiti","affiliation":["Embedded Security Group, Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute of IT Security, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Sbeiti","id":"37643553500"},{"name":"Michael Silbermann","affiliation":["Embedded Security Group, Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute of IT Security, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Silbermann","id":"37643648600"},{"name":"Axel Poschmann","affiliation":["Embedded Security Group, Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute of IT Security, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Poschmann","id":"37428097100"},{"name":"Christof Paar","affiliation":["Embedded Security Group, Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute of IT Security, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Christof","lastName":"Paar","id":"37282655400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3847-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4914893","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design space exploration of present implementations for FPGAS","abstract":"In this paper we investigate the performance of the block cipher PRESENT on FPGAs.

Results for big operands show that the decimal adder works faster than an equivalent binary implementation and furthermore the coding / decoding processes are no more needed.","publicationTitle":"2009 5th Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4914881/4914882/04914894.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPL.2009.4914894","doi":"10.1109/SPL.2009.4914894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4914882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decimal addition in FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decimal addition in FPGA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914894/","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4914894/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646228","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decimal addition in FPGA","confLoc":"Sao Carlos, Brazil","sourcePdf":"Paper_32_-_Decimal_Addition_in_FPGA.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056275S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4914881","isNumber":"4914882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4914881","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4914882","articleId":"4914894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4914898,"authors":[{"name":"Miaoqing Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Washington University, USA"],"firstName":"Miaoqing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37554049400"},{"name":"Olivier Serres","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Washington University, USA"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Serres","id":"38270444900"},{"name":"Tarek El-Ghazawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Washington University, USA"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"El-Ghazawi","id":"38192796200"},{"name":"Greg Newby","affiliation":["Arctic Region Supercomputing Center, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, USA"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Newby","id":"37322418600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3847-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4914898","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Image registration","Discrete wavelet transforms","Field programmable gate arrays","Coprocessors","Application software","Software algorithms","Parallel processing","Image processing","Image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","image matching","image registration","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameterized hardware design","reconfigurable computer","image registration","FPGA coprocessor","rigid-body transformation","exhaustive search algorithm","discrete wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"Reconfigurable computers (RCs) with hardware (FPGA) co-processors can achieve significant performance improvement compared to traditional computers for certain categories of applications. The potential amount of speedup an RC can deliver depends on the intrinsic parallelism of the target application as well as the characteristics of the target platform. In this paper, we use image registration implementation as a case study to show how a hardware implementation is parameterized by co-processor architecture, particularly the local memory layout. Image registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match two or more pictures taken at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. One of several basic transformations in image registration is rigid-body transformation, which is composed of a combination of a rotation thetas, a translation (t\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</sub>\n,t\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</sub>\n), and a scale change (s). In this work, rigid-body transformation is applied on the test image to register it with the reference image; and correlation coefficient is used as the similarity metric between the two images. Two different algorithms, exhaustive search algorithm and discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based search algorithm, are implemented on hardware (i.e., FPGA device on Cray XD1 reconfigurable computer). The hardware implementation of exhaustive search algorithm is 10times faster than the software implementation. The performance improvement of DWT-based search algorithm in hardware is roughly 2 folds compared to the corresponding software implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameterized hardware design on reconfigurable computers: An image registration case study","publicationTitle":"2009 5th Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","doi":"10.1109/SPL.2009.4914898","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th Southern Conference on Programmable Logic (SPL)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4914881/4914882/04914898.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPL.2009.4914898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4914882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4914898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4914898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Parameterized hardware design on reconfigurable computers: An image registration case study","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4914898/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646232","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameterized hardware design on reconfigurable computers: An image registration case study","confLoc":"Sao Carlos, Brazil","sourcePdf":"Paper_41-Parameterized_Hardware_Design_on_Reconfig.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084705S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4914881","isNumber":"4914882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4914881","xplore-issue":"4914882","articleId":"4914898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4914901,"authors":[{"name":"Advait Jain","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Advait","lastName":"Jain","id":"37537849300"},{"name":"Pulkit Gambhir","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Pulkit","lastName":"Gambhir","id":"37637002700"},{"name":"Priyanka Jindal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Priyanka","lastName":"Jindal","id":"37639997600"},{"name":"M Balakrishnan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Balakrishnan","id":"37276191600"},{"name":"Kolin Paul","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Kolin","lastName":"Paul","id":"37400818200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3847-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4914901","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Prediction algorithms","Hardware","Amino acids","Bioinformatics","Application software","Parallel processing","Protein engineering","Computer applications","Minimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","biomedical engineering","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA accelerator","protein structure prediction","bioinformatics application","CPU cycle","tertiary structure prediction","proteins","codesign methodology","hardware accelerator","protein energy minimization","core functions"]}],"abstract":"Bioinformatics applications are computationally very expensive programs.

It has been shown that significant speedups can be obtained by moving core time consuming functions onto an FPGA. It has been shown that a 5 fold decrease in the run time of the application can be achieved by simply moving one core function into hardware. Upto an order of magnitude improvement in runtimes can be obtained by moving two functions (core functions in many other bioinformatics applications) which consume 99% of the CPU cycles in the chosen application.

In this context fault injection plays an important role in the process of fault tolerance validation. As a result many fault injection tools have emerged during the last decade. However these tools only operate on specific domains and can therefore be referred to as hardware- or software-, simulation- or emulation based techniques. In this paper we present FuSE, a single fault injection tool which covers multiple domains as well as different fault injection purposes.

Based on the reconfigurability of FPGA devices, the system can be extended to swap modules optimized for different parameters, and to adopt more advanced registration algorithms. We show that a single core on 412 MHz XC5VLX330T FPGA can evaluate a rigid transformation of a 3D image with 16 million voxels in 35 ms.

resonance (SSR) is a potential problem in power systems having a steam turbine-generator connected to a series compensated transmission line. Flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) controllers are widely applied to mitigate SSR. In this paper, two control ways for SSR damping for the gate-controlled series capacitor (GCSC) are presented. The first method is constant power control based on proportional (P) controller and the other one is based on Takagi-Sugeno (TS)-type fuzzy logic controller. The First IEEE Benchmark Model for the analysis of the SSR phenomenon is adopted. The actual possibility of controlling SSR was verified by MATLAB program. Three different GCSC ratings are evaluated. It will be shown that although the GCSC with the designed constant power control based on the P controller in the all considered GCSC ratings can damp SSR, it can not prepare a good dynamic response for the system. A comparative study between proportional and TS fuzzy controller is carried out showing that the performance of TS fuzzy controlled GCSC is better than that of P controlled GCSC, and SSR as well as electromechanical power oscillation can be properly damped by this method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915145/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4915145/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645820","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of proportional and TS fuzzy controlled GCSC for SSR mitigation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of proportional and TS fuzzy controlled GCSC for SSR mitigation","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"paper_026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045515S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907389","isNumber":"4915129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907389","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4915129","articleId":"4915145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4915147,"authors":[{"name":"S.

But, the most significant problem associated with these compensators is the capacitor voltage imbalances and drift due to DC components in the zero sequence current, resulting in degradation of tracking performance of the voltage source inverter. This paper proposes a carrier based PWM control for an inverter-chopper circuit in order to regulate the capacitor voltages to their reference values. To demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of the above control scheme, a three-phase four-wire, three-level neutral point clamped compensator system is taken as an example. Detailed simulation has been carried out in PSCAD 4.2.1. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4915147/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645821","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Capacitor voltage balancing in neutral clamped inverters for DSTATCOM application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitor voltage balancing in neutral clamped inverters for DSTATCOM application","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"paper_031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058073S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907389","isNumber":"4915129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907389","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4915129","articleId":"4915147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4915152,"authors":[{"name":"G.

UPQC can simultaneously fulfill different objectives like, maintaining a balanced sinusoidal (harmonic free) nominal voltage at the load bus, eliminating harmonics in the source currents, load balancing and power factor correction. Keeping the cost effectiveness of UPQC, it is desirable to have a minimum VA loading of the UPQC, for a given system without compromising compensation capability. Hence, a methodology has been proposed in this work to minimize VA loading of UPQC considering the effects of source voltage and load current distortion. The series active filter of UPQC can be made to inject voltages in such a way that a minimum VA loading of UPQC is possible. The optimal angle at which series voltage has to be injected so as to have minimum VA loading of UPQC is computed by particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The proposed method has been validated through detailed simulation studies. The VA loading without optimization and with optimization has been compared.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907389/4915129/04915152.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"557","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives","doi":"10.1109/POWERENG.2009.4915152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERENG.2009.4915152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4915129","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimization of VA loading of Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power quality","Voltage","Active filters","Power system harmonics","Power harmonic filters","Load management","Power factor correction","Costs","Particle swarm optimization","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","harmonics suppression","particle swarm optimisation","power factor correction","power filters","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified power quality conditioner","series active filter","shunt active filter","balanced sinusoidal nominal voltage","harmonics elimination","load balancing","power factor correction","load current distortion","particle swarm optimization technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Minimization of VA loading of Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4915152/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645826","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimization of VA loading of Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC)","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"paper_037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055379S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907389","isNumber":"4915129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907389","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4915129","articleId":"4915152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4915157,"authors":[{"name":"Adel A.

Since the optimal PID controller parameters are dependent on the selected weighting factors, the weighting factors was also treated as dynamic optimizing parameters within the particle swarm optimization as a dual optimization and global selection of PID controller optimal parameters as well as best set of weighting factors.

In this paper, we present a structure allowing the achievement of 6 kV phase to phase motor voltage and a control strategy that enables to obtain 5 levels on output voltage. However, using asynchronous PWM at high speed use, switching losses in the inverter become too high due to switching frequency which has to be at least 10 times the modulation frequency. Thus, one solution consists in using synchronous PWM with which the number of switching is reduced. Thus, this document proposes a synchronous method to respond to some criteria such as harmonic elimination, voltage level increasing and losses balancing on the two cells legs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective harmonic elimination PWM applied to H-bridge topology in high speed applications","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives","doi":"10.1109/POWERENG.2009.4915189","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907389/4915129/04915189.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERENG.2009.4915189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4915129","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Selective harmonic elimination PWM applied to H-bridge topology in high speed applications","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4915189/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10645863","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective harmonic elimination PWM applied to H-bridge topology in high speed applications","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"paper_111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07904S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907389","isNumber":"4915129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907389","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4915129","articleId":"4915189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4915243,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Electrical load forecast might be performed over different time intervals of short, medium and long term. Various techniques have been proposed for short term, medium term or long term load forecasting. In this study we employ artificial neural networks (ANN) and regression (linear and log-linear) approaches for annual electricity load forecasting. This study presents a model that is affected by two economical parameters which are Real-GDP and Population. Using Real-GDP instead of nominal-GDP can provide more accuracy because the effects of inflation are considered in the structure of such model and this will cause the results to be more reliable. To improve forecasting accuracy of the model we apply data preprocessing techniques. Forecasting capability of each approach is evaluated by calculating three separate statistical evaluations of the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). All evaluations indicate that the accuracy of ANN which is trained with preprocessed data is remarkably better than the other two conventional approaches.","doi":"10.1109/POWERENG.2009.4915245","startPage":"675","endPage":"679","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERENG.2009.4915245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4915129","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907389/4915129/04915245.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks and regression approaches comparison for forecasting Iran's annual electricity load","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915245/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks and regression approaches comparison for forecasting Iran's annual electricity load","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4915245/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10645918","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Networks and regression approaches comparison for forecasting Iran's annual electricity load","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"paper_189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085572S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907389","isNumber":"4915129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907389","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4915129","articleId":"4915245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4915580,"authors":[{"name":"Vikram Krishnamurthy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5238723/4915580/4915580-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vikram Krishnamurthy (S'90\u2013M'91\u2013SM'99\u2013 F'05) was born in 1966.

We consider a network of cognitive radios (CRs) where each CR obtains noisy multivariate measurements of the quality of several logical channels and needs to decide which channel to access. Assuming the CRs are rational devices, each CR determines which channel to access, based on its expected throughput and Bayesian estimate of the intention of other CRs. We formulate conditions for which the Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) of the resulting global game is monotonically increasing in the quality of the logical channel. This leads to a simple characterization of the competitive optimal behavior of the system as a function of the prior probability distribution of spectrum hole occupancy, channel quality and observation noise. In obtaining the characterization of the BNE, we extend recent results in univariate global games to the multivariate case.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2022860","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/04915580.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2022860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"3999","endPage":"4013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Spectrum Access Amongst Cognitive Radios\u2014An Interacting Multivariate Global Game-Theoretic Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Spectrum Access Amongst Cognitive Radios\u2014An Interacting Multivariate Global Game-Theoretic Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915580/","volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4915580/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869460","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Spectrum Access Amongst Cognitive Radios\u2014An Interacting Multivariate Global Game-Theoretic Approach","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-vkrishnamurthy-2022860.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110275S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"4915580","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4915581,"authors":[{"name":"Yongqiang Ye","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Ye","id":"37279357100"},{"name":"Peter X.

These include 16-ary PDM-QPSK, 64-ary PDM-8PSK, 64-ary PDM-8QAM as well as 256-ary PDM-16 QAM. We show that high-speed QPSK, 8PSK, 8QAM, and 16QAM can all be generated using commercially available optical modulators using only binary electrical drive signals through novel synthesis methods, and that all of these modulation formats can be detected using a universal receiver front-end and digital coherent detection. We show that the constant modulus algorithm (CMA), which is highly effective for blind polarization recovery of PDM-QPSK and PDM-8PSK signals, is much less effective for PDM-8QAM and PDM-16 QAM. We then present a recently proposed, cascaded multi-modulus algorithm for these cases. In addition to the DSP algorithms used for constellation recovery, we also describe a DSP algorithm to improve the performance of a coherent receiver using single-ended photo-detection. The system impact of ASE noise, laser phase noise, narrowband optical filtering and fiber nonlinear effects has been investigated. For high-level modulation formats using full receiver-side digital compensation, it is shown that the requirement on LO phase noise is more stringent than the signal laser. We also show that RZ pulse shaping significantly improves filter- and fiber-nonlinear tolerance. Finally we present three high-spectral-efficiency and high-speed DWDM transmission experiments implementing these ML-MDC technologies.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2022765","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5170198/04915582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2022765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170198","startPage":"3641","endPage":"3653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Level, Multi-Dimensional Coding for High-Speed and High-Spectral-Efficiency Optical Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Level, Multi-Dimensional Coding for High-Speed and High-Spectral-Efficiency Optical Transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"16","publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10858746","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4915582/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Level, Multi-Dimensional Coding for High-Speed and High-Spectral-Efficiency Optical Transmission","sourcePdf":"jlt-xzhou-2022765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083739S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5170198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5170198","articleId":"4915582","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4915740,"authors":[{"name":"Kendall Ananyi","affiliation":["Financial CAD Corporation, Surrey, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Kendall","lastName":"Ananyi","id":"37644167100"},{"name":"Hamad Alrimeih","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamad","lastName":"Alrimeih","id":"37644162800"},{"name":"Daler Rakhmatov","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada"],"firstName":"Daler","lastName":"Rakhmatov","id":"37295812600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4915740","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":789},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915740","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Elliptic curve cryptography","NIST","Arithmetic","Galois fields","Elliptic curves","Cryptographic protocols","Protection","Security","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","multiplying circuits","public key cryptography","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible hardware processor","elliptic curve cryptography","NIST prime finite field","private information exchange","public medium","data protection method","unauthorized access","scalar multiplication","point operation","modular arithmetic operation","modular addition","modular subtraction","modular multiplication","modular inversion","sequence","field-programmable gate-array","frequency 60 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)","modular arithmetic","prime finite fields","programmable hardware"]}],"abstract":"Exchange of private information over a public medium must incorporate a method for data protection against unauthorized access.

These procedures overcome a major drawback of graphs, which consists of a serious lack of algorithms for classification. This paper is inspired by the idea of representing graphs through dissimilarities and extends our previous work to the more general setting of Lipschitz embeddings. In an experimental evaluation, we empirically confirm that classifiers that rely on the original graph distances can be outperformed by a classification system using the Lipschitz embedded graphs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915743/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879849","pubMedId":"19447721","htmlLink":"/document/4915743/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Graph Classification by Means of Lipschitz Embedding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph Classification by Means of Lipschitz Embedding","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-riesen-2019264.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151503S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5238715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5238715","articleId":"4915743","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4915747,"authors":[{"name":"Ranadip Pal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5200771/4915747/4915747-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ranadip Pal (M'09) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and electrical communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 2002 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.","In August 2007, he joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas Tech University, Lubbock as an Assistant Professor.

Given a total energy budget allowable to be used by all sensors, there exists a tradeoff between the subset of active sensors and the energy used by each active sensor in order to minimize the estimation MSE. To determine the optimal quantization bit rate and transmission energy of each sensor, a concept of equivalent unit-energy MSE function is introduced. Based on this concept, an optimal energy-constrained distributed estimation algorithm for homogeneous sensor networks and a quasi-optimal energy-constrained distributed estimation algorithm for heterogeneous sensor networks are proposed. Moreover, the theoretical energy-distortion performance bound for distributed estimation is addressed and it is shown that the proposed algorithm is quasi-optimal within a factor 2 of the theoretical lower bound. Simulation results also show that the proposed method can achieve a significant reduction in the estimation MSE when compared with other uniform schemes. Finally, the proposed algorithm is easy to implement in a distributed manner and it adapts well to the dynamic sensor environments.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2022874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/04915748.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2022874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","startPage":"3746","endPage":"3758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Estimation in Energy-Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Estimation in Energy-Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869437","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4915748/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Estimation in Energy-Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-galregib-2022874.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094995S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"4915748","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4915749,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Jun Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Jin-Jun","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37278647100"},{"name":"Arye Nehorai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Arye","lastName":"Nehorai","id":"37265777100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4915749","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Controlling the polarization information in transmitted waveforms enables improving the performance of radar systems. We consider the design of optimal polarizations at both the radar transmitter and receiver for the estimation of target scattering embedded in clutter. The goal is to minimize the mean squared error of the scattering estimation subject to an average radar pulse power constraint. Under the condition that the target and clutter scattering covariance matrices are known a priori, we show that such a problem is equivalent to the optimal design of a radar sensing matrix that contains the polarization information. We formulate the optimal design as a nonlinear optimization problem and then recast it in a convex form and is thus efficiently solvable by semi-definite programming (SDP). We compare the sensing performance of the optimally selected polarization over conventional approaches. Our numerical results demonstrate that a significant amount of power gain is achieved in the target scattering estimation through such an optimal design.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/04915749.pdf","startPage":"4142","endPage":"4147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2022887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2022887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Transmitter and Receiver Polarization Optimization for Scattering Estimation in Clutter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Polarization","Signal processing","Radar scattering","Covariance matrix","Sensor arrays","Speech processing","Radar clutter","Array signal processing","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","electromagnetic wave polarisation","mathematical programming","mean square error methods","radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitter-receiver polarization optimization","scattering estimation","radar systems","mean squared error","clutter scattering covariance matrices","semi-definite programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive estimation","optimization methods","radar polarimetry","scattering matrices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint Transmitter and Receiver Polarization Optimization for Scattering Estimation in Clutter","volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4915749/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869447","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Transmitter and Receiver Polarization Optimization for Scattering Estimation in Clutter","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-jxiao-2022887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065681S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"4915749","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4915752,"authors":[{"name":"Yunlong Cai","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4915752/4915752-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yunlong Cai received the B.S. degree in computer science from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K., in 2006.

The proposed space-time receiver is then further combined with cascaded DF stages to mitigate the deleterious effects of error propagation for uncoded schemes. To adjust the parameters of the receiver, we also present modified adaptive stochastic gradient (SG) and recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms that automatically switch to the best-available interference cancellation feedback branch and jointly estimate the feedforward and feedback filters. The performance of the system with beamforming and diversity configurations is also considered. Simulation results for an uplink scenario with uncoded systems show that the proposed space-time MPF-DF detector outperforms existing schemes such as linear, parallel DF (P-DF), and successive DF (S-DF) receivers in terms of bit error rate (BER) and achieves a substantial capacity increase in terms of the number of users, compared with the existing schemes. We also derive the expressions for MMSE achieved by the analyzed DF structures, including the novel scheme, with imperfect and perfect feedback and expressions of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the beamforming and diversity configurations with linear receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Adaptive MMSE Multiuser Decision Feedback Detectors With Multiple-Feedback Interference Cancellation for CDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2022830","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04915752.pdf","startPage":"4129","endPage":"4140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2022830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915752/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Adaptive MMSE Multiuser Decision Feedback Detectors With Multiple-Feedback Interference Cancellation for CDMA Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4915752/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903069","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Adaptive MMSE Multiuser Decision Feedback Detectors With Multiple-Feedback Interference Cancellation for CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-cai-2022830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121299S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4915752","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4915754,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan J.

A weighted alternating least squares (WALS) algorithm is derived that iteratively solves for the direction independent complex gains of the array elements, their noise powers and their gains in the direction of the calibrator sources. An extension of the problem is the case where the apparent calibrator source locations are unknown, e.g., due to refractive propagation paths. For this case, the WALS method is supplemented with weighted subspace fitting (WSF) direction finding techniques.

The design approach is applied to design 10-Gigabit Ethernet transceivers over copper cables. For a specified encoding speed, the proposed method requires substantially lower complexity in terms of area and storage. Furthermore, this method is generic and can be adapted easily for other LDPC codes. One major advantage of this design is that it does not require column swapping and it maintains compatibility with optimized LDPC decoders. For a 10-Gigabit Ethernet transceiver which is compliant with the IEEE 802.3 an standard, the proposed sequential (5-Parallel) hybrid architecture has the following implementation properties: critical path: (log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(324) + 1)T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">xor</sub>\n + T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">and</sub>\n, number of XOR gates: 11 056, number of and gates: 1620, and ROM storage: 104 976 bits (which can be minimized to 52 488 bits using additional hardware).

When the subsystems are modeled by affine equations, a direct adaptive controller is devised based on the Lyapunov theory, so that the stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by introducing a suitably driven adaptive rule. A neuro-based structure is proposed when the subsystems are nonaffine, and the stability analysis is also performed based on the Lyapunov theory. Moreover, the unknown interactions among the subsystems are considered as having a nonlinear function against the simple form considered for the affine case. The proposed controllers are employed in an inverted two-pendulum system, and their promising performances are illustrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5159565/04915779.pdf","startPage":"2459","endPage":"2467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2016388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2016388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Adaptive Control of Large-Scale Affine and Nonaffine Nonlinear Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Large-scale systems","Nonlinear systems","Control systems","Programmable control","Nonlinear control systems","Stability analysis","Neural networks","Automatic control","Aerospace industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","decentralised control","large-scale systems","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized adaptive control","large-scale affine systems","nonaffine nonlinear systems","affine equations","Lyapunov theory","closed-loop system stability","neuro-based structure","nonlinear function","inverted two-pendulum system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","decentralized affine and nonaffine nonlinear system","radial basis neural network (RBNN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Adaptive Control of Large-Scale Affine and Nonaffine Nonlinear Systems","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4915779/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10774741","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Adaptive Control of Large-Scale Affine and Nonaffine Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tim-karimi-2016388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091428S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5159565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5159565","articleId":"4915779","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4915782,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Stala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Drive and Industrial Equipment, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5154028/4915782/4915782-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert Stala was born in Krakow, Poland, in 1972.

In such an environment, collision among readers becomes a serious problem. Existing anticollision algorithms, depending on the information of neighboring readers, may require constant effort in order to grasp such information. Although it may be given by a server or a coordinator, they may not be suitable in dense and dynamic RFID networks with mobile readers. In this paper, we propose an efficient reader anticollision algorithm using a polling server in dense and dynamic RFID networks with mobile readers. Owing to the assistance of the server, the readers can rapidly decide whether they can work or not without interfering neighbors and can be easily synchronized. Our proposed algorithm is simple and makes readers aware of neighbors to minimize reader collisions. Performance evaluation shows how many readers can operate in a network and indicates that our proposed algorithm is more efficient than distributed color selection, colorwave, and hierarchical Q-learning algorithm, particularly in dense and mobile environments.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2021869","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5154028/04915784.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2021869","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"2326","endPage":"2336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Reader Anticollision Algorithm in Dense RFID Networks With Mobile RFID Readers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Reader Anticollision Algorithm in Dense RFID Networks With Mobile RFID Readers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915784/","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4915784/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10736260","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Reader Anticollision Algorithm in Dense RFID Networks With Mobile RFID Readers","sourcePdf":"tie-lee-2021869.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072608S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5154028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5154028","articleId":"4915784","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4915796,"authors":[{"name":"Rute Almeida","affiliation":["Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en red en Bioingenieria Biomateriales y Nanomedicina, Zaragoza, Arag\u00c3\u00b3n, ES"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5165131/4915796/4915796-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rute Almeida was born in Porto, Portugal, in 1979.

SL delineation is then applied over this optimal derived lead. The ML strategy produces a reduced error dispersion compared to SL results, thus providing more robust, accurate, and stable boundary locations than any electrocardiographic lead by itself and outperforming strategies based on lead selection rules after SL delineation.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2021658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5165131/04915796.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2021658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165131","startPage":"1996","endPage":"2005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilead ECG Delineation Using Spatially Projected Leads From Wavelet Transform Loops","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4915796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multilead ECG Delineation Using Spatially Projected Leads From Wavelet Transform Loops","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4915796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10763986","pubMedId":"19447698","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4915796/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilead ECG Delineation Using Spatially Projected Leads From Wavelet Transform Loops","sourcePdf":"tbme-almeida-2021658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072561S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5165131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5165131","articleId":"4915796","onlineDate":"12 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4917428,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiane da Silva Morony","affiliation":["Faculdades COC, Ara\u00e7atuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Cristiane da Silva","lastName":"Morony","id":"37640680000"},{"name":"Edward David Moreno","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Edward David","lastName":"Moreno","id":"37591676800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-0992"}],"articleNumber":"4917428","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":556},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Region 9","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/reg/9/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Software algorithms","Paper technology","DNA","Genetics","Sequences","Heuristic algorithms","Dynamic programming","Bioinformatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","C language","dynamic programming","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","Gens alignment","DNA genetic sequences","dynamic programming","C language","VHDL","bioinformatics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algoritmos Global e Local","FPGAs","Programa\u00e7\u00e3o Dinamica","Sequenciamento de Gens"]}],"abstract":"The paper has as objective to implement, in hardware-making use of FPGA technology, the algorithms that are considered as standard for the comparison and the global and local alignment of the DNA genetic sequences.

Provided an appropriately dimensioned pilot grid, 3D-PACE is shown to substantially reduce the required pilot overhead without sacrificing channel estimation accuracy.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917487.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917487","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917487","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917487","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Robot control","Internet","Delay","Mobile robots","Wireless application protocol","Propagation losses","Traffic control","Base stations","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot aided channel estimation","MIMO-OFDM","spatially correlated channels","pilot symbols","transmit antennas","three-dimensional channel estimation","channel estimation accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917487/","displayDocTitle":"3D Pilot Aided Channel Estimation","accessionNumber":"10646261","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917487/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Pilot Aided Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S08P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059594S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4917491,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Manolakis","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Manolakis","id":"37641036200"},{"name":"David Manuel Gutierrez Estevez","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"David Manuel","lastName":"Gutierrez Estevez","id":"37636355200"},{"name":"Volker Jungnickel","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Jungnickel","id":"37280807000"},{"name":"Wen Xu","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278552800"},{"name":"Christian Drewes","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Drewes","id":"37298721800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917491","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":98,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":3471},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","OFDM","Downlink","Frequency estimation","Frequency domain analysis","Long Term Evolution","Communications Society","Transmitting antennas","Binary sequences","Autocorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","correlation methods","multipath channels","synchronisation","telecommunication network reliability","time-frequency analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell search","3GPP LTE system","time synchronization","frequency synchronization","long-term evolution downlink","cell-specific reference signal","cyclic prefix-based autocorrelation","integer frequency offset","frequency domain analysis","time domain analysis","primary synchronization signal","secondary synchronization signal","cell detection reliability","multipath channel condition","carrier frequency mismatch"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we investigate the time and frequency synchronization as well as the sector and cell search for the 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) downlink.

In a cooperative retransmission scheme, these neighbor nodes, known as relays, can retransmit the failed packet on behalf of the original source node. The challenge is that multiple concurrent transmissions may lead to collision at the destination, and thus the problem is to decide which relay should help in retransmitting the failed packet so that the destination can successfully receive it. This paper proposes a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) model for selecting the relays to perform the cooperative retransmission. The proposed DEC- POMDP model does not require global channel state information (CSI). In addition, it is robust to noise in CSI measurements. Furthermore, the proposed DEC-POMDP scheme utilizes the gradient descent learning method to eliminate the need for a wireless channel model. We show that the proposed learning method based on the DEC-POMDP model can perform near optimally in the absence of a channel model and despite its implementation simplicity.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917494.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cooperative Retransmission Scheme in Wireless Networks with Imperfect Channel State Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Channel state information","Relays","Throughput","Learning systems","Noise robustness","Communications Society","Computer networks","Dynamic programming","Peer to peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative retransmission","wireless network","channel state information","packet transmission","decentralized partially observable Markov decision process","gradient descent learning method","wireless channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Cooperative Retransmission Scheme in Wireless Networks with Imperfect Channel State Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917494/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917494/","accessionNumber":"10646268","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cooperative Retransmission Scheme in Wireless Networks with Imperfect Channel State Information","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S17P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055419S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4917496,"authors":[{"name":"Siva D.

The proposed SIQR-GR channel estimation algorithm employs sequences of scaled Givens rotations to recursively processes data decisions corresponding to the SFBC groups within each OFDM block. As a result of the groupwise recursive processing, the proposed SIQR-GR scheme yields improved system performance under doubly-selective (i.e., frequency- selective and fast fading) channels. To evaluate the performance advantages of SIQR-GR we compare the normalized mean square error (NMSE) and symbol error rate (SER) performances of SIQR-GR to those corresponding to previously proposed channel estimation schemes. Furthermore, we also present computational complexity comparisons between SIQR-GR and the previously proposed schemes. These comparisons show an excellent performance-complexity tradeoff achieved by SIQR-GR over the previously proposed solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917496.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Decision Directed Square-Root Free Inverse QR-Decomposition Based Groupwise Recursive Channel Estimator for SFBC-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recursive estimation","OFDM","Channel estimation","Fading","Frequency estimation","Decoding","Iterative algorithms","System performance","Mean square error methods","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","channel estimation","matrix decomposition","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SFBC-OFDM system","space-frequency block coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","groupwise recursive channel estimator","decision directed square-root free inverse QR-decomposition","doubly-selective channel","normalized mean square error","symbol error rate","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Decision Directed Square-Root Free Inverse QR-Decomposition Based Groupwise Recursive Channel Estimator for SFBC-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917496/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646270","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Decision Directed Square-Root Free Inverse QR-Decomposition Based Groupwise Recursive Channel Estimator for SFBC-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S31P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05338S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4917498,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran M.

In the HRS scheme, when the destination decodes successfully, the relay nodes will remain silent. Otherwise, optimal relay node has to be determined to make an additional transmission. In this process, all the relays are divided into two groups, referred to as an amplify-and-forward (AAF) relay group and a decode-and-forward (DAF) relay group depending on whether they can decode correctly or not. The relay, which has the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination, will be selected from both AAF and DAF relay groups. Simulation results show that the proposed relay selection scheme significantly outperforms the conventional AAF selection in terms of both frame error rate (FER) and throughput, and these performance gains considerably grow as the number of relay nodes increases.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917507","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917507.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Relay Selection Scheme Using Differential Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917507/","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Relay Selection Scheme Using Differential Modulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646281","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917507/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Relay Selection Scheme Using Differential Modulation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S43P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053105S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4917509,"authors":[{"name":"Zan Li","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, XiDian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zan","lastName":"Li","id":"37279082100"},{"name":"Jiangbo Si","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, XiDian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiangbo","lastName":"Si","id":"37402423800"},{"name":"Feng Lan","affiliation":["China Electronic Systems Engineering Corporation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Lan","id":"37627677400"},{"name":"Xiaojun Chen","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, XiDian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37632801200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917509","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","Data communication","Channel estimation","Computational complexity","Throughput","Time varying systems","Maximum likelihood estimation","Time-varying channels","State estimation","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","channel estimation","communication complexity","data communication","maximum likelihood detection","radio receivers","radiocommunication","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint maximum likelihood sequence detection receiver","meteor burst communication","variable rate data transmission","time-varying meteor channel","multipath rays","data detection","channel estimation","per-survivor processing","computational complexity","adaptive state reduction","trellis diagram","adaptive threshold","computer simulations","MBC systems","adaptive modulation","adaptive coding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917509","abstract":"According to the characteristics of meteor burst channels, variable rate data transmission is often employed to improve the average system throughput, and the time-varying meteor channel in the presence of multi-path rays brings difficulties in both data detection and channel estimation at the receiver. As we know, per-survivor processing (PSP) based on the joint data and channel estimation of maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) is often considered to obtain the optimal detection performance for time-varying channels. However, the great computational complexity of PSP is the major problem in practice. In this paper we propose an adaptive state reduction of PSP (ASRP) algorithm with few states in the trellis diagram for exponential decay of meteor channels. Based on the estimation of the meteor channel parameters, the adaptive threshold is derived to select the states close to the right one in the trellis to reduce the complexity of PSP. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations results show that the ASRP we proposed provides suboptimal performance and makes good tradeoff between the performance and the computational complexity, so that the reliable data transmission can be realized for MBC systems with adaptive modulation and coding (AMC).","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917509","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917509.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint MLSD Receiver for Meteor Burst Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Joint MLSD Receiver for Meteor Burst Communication","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917509/","accessionNumber":"10646283","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917509/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint MLSD Receiver for Meteor Burst Communication","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S13P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085272S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917513,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37634905800"},{"name":"Q.

For the sake of comprehensiveness, the paper compares the performance of this new diversity technique with a conventional pairing diversity technique and with the well known maximum gain combined (MGC) time diversity. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional pairing technique, in terms of BER, and with proper code allocation, is also able to outperform time diversity systems. The new algorithm is able to accommodate up to 200% system loading even under severe asynchronous and multipath conditions.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917529","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917529.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Pairing Diversity Technique with Dynamic Code Allocation for CDMA Systems Employing Polyphase Sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917529/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Pairing Diversity Technique with Dynamic Code Allocation for CDMA Systems Employing Polyphase Sequences","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646303","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917529/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Pairing Diversity Technique with Dynamic Code Allocation for CDMA Systems Employing Polyphase Sequences","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S07P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071994S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917533,"authors":[{"name":"Rui-Ting Ma","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rui-Ting","lastName":"Ma","id":"37634426700"},{"name":"Yu-Pin Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Pin","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37397147200"},{"name":"Kai-Ten Feng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Ten","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289448000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917533","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":648},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Open source hardware","Frequency estimation","Data communication","Communications Society","Channel state information","FCC","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Markov processes","protocols","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["POMDP-based spectrum handoff protocol","partially observable cognitive radio network","static spectrum allocation","spectrum utilization","frequency spectrum","network channel","partially observable Markov decision process","network information","channel state information","POSH algorithm","target channel selection"]}],"abstract":"Recent studies have been conducted to indicate the ineffective usage of licensed bands due to the static spectrum allocation. In order to improve the spectrum utilization, the cognitive radio (CR) is therefore suggested to dynamically exploit the opportunistic primary frequency spectrums. How to provide efficient spectrum handoff has been considered a crucial issue in the CR networks. Existing spectrum handoff algorithms assume that all the channels within the network can be correctly sensed by the CR users in order to perform appropriate spectrum hand-off process. However, this assumption is considered impracticable in realistic circumstances primarily due to the excessive time required for the CR user to sense the entire spectrum space. In this paper, the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is exploited to estimate the network information by partially sensing the frequency spectrums. A POMDP-based spectrum handoff (POSH) scheme is proposed to determine the optimal target channel for spectrum handoff according to the partially observable channel state information. By adopting the policy resulted from the POSH algorithm for target channel selection, minimal waiting time at each occurrence of spectrum handoff can be achieved. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed POSH scheme can effectively minimize the required waiting time for spectrum handoff in the CR networks.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917533","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917533.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A POMDP-Based Spectrum Handoff Protocol for Partially Observable Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A POMDP-Based Spectrum Handoff Protocol for Partially Observable Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917533/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646307","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917533/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A POMDP-Based Spectrum Handoff Protocol for Partially Observable Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S06P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046497S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4917534,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Kliks","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Kliks","id":"37645975800"},{"name":"Hanna Bogucka","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Hanna","lastName":"Bogucka","id":"37273442700"},{"name":"Ivan Stupia","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Stupia","id":"37591299100"},{"name":"Vincenzo Lottici","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Lottici","id":"37271164300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917534","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Pulse shaping methods","Digital video broadcasting","Prototypes","Resource management","Context modeling","Fading","Pulse modulation","Communications Society","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pragmatic bit allocation algorithm","power allocation algorithm","NOFDM signalling","nonorthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Campello approach"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel pragmatic bit and power allocation algorithm for Non Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (NOFDM) systems is presented.

In this paper, we propose a region-based downlink scheduling algorithm for QoS-guaranteed services in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding systems. In contrast with conventional slot- based scheduling, region-based scheduling allocates bandwidth based on resource regions consisting of several slots. The proposed algorithm combines QoS-urgent-degree and the proportional fairness to select candidate connections, and determines the size of each SDMA region. In addition, multi-user scheduling is performed in all SDMA regions to completely exploit spatial multiplexing gains.

Recently, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission techniques have been widely deployed in wireless systems, while a multi-user MIMO-based collision mitigation scheme in uplink WLANs was proposed by authors, and we showed the scheme is very efficient for the uplink performance. However, for an infrastructure-based WLAN, we observe a significant performance unbalance problem between uplink and downlink, compared to the conventional WLANs. Moreover, access point (AP) yields lower throughput performance than each contending station(STA). In order to solve this unbalance problem between uplink and downlink, we adopt a modified minimum contention window (CWmin) adjustment scheme and a random piggyback scheme to the multi-user MIMO-based WLANs. We also develop an analytical model to evaluate the performance of multi-user MIMO-based WLANs in a saturated traffic environment.

The VTSA scheme allows multiple communication links in the network to simultaneously use the same time-slot, thus increases system throughput. Additionally, by coupling to higher-order modulation schemes, higher data rate can be achieved. The combination of both is found to be capable of realizing a multi- Gbps WPAN system. However, the employment of the VTSA scheme causes the generation of co-channel interference (CCI) in the system, and CCI is found to affect the modulation schemes differently. This paper investigates the tradeoff parameters between varying CCI due to the employment of the VTSA scheme, and the higher-order modulations applied. As a result, it is found that the VTSA scheme is capable of increasing 30% of the system throughput. It is also found that in low CCI environment, 16QAM offers the highest achievable system throughput, whereas when CCI becomes higher, the more-robust BPSK offers the highest throughput.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917552","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917552.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Virtual Time-Slot Allocation Throughput Enhancement Scheme with Multiple Modulations for a Multi-Gbps Millimeter-Wave WPAN System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917552/","displayDocTitle":"A Virtual Time-Slot Allocation Throughput Enhancement Scheme with Multiple Modulations for a Multi-Gbps Millimeter-Wave WPAN System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646326","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917552/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Virtual Time-Slot Allocation Throughput Enhancement Scheme with Multiple Modulations for a Multi-Gbps Millimeter-Wave WPAN System","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S22P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061556S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917555,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhao","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37537641500"},{"name":"Marc Kuhn","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Kuhn","id":"37285066500"},{"name":"Armin Wittneben","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Wittneben","id":"37264987800"},{"name":"Gerhard Bauch","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Bauch","id":"37266555700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917555","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Channel estimation","Relays","Decoding","Broadcast technology","Transmitting antennas","Communications Society","Communications technology","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel coding","channel estimation","decoding","fading channels","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO bidirectional broadcast channel","self-interference aided channel estimation","two-way decode-and-forward relaying system","block-fading channel model","spectral efficiency"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the broadcast (BRC) phase of two-way decode-and-forward (DF) relaying systems. The channel in that phase is called the bidirectional broadcast channel. Its achievable rates are calculated when the self-interference aided channel estimation scheme is applied. We consider a block- fading channel model in the BRC phase and exploit the self- interference that is inherent in two-way relaying techniques to get an initial estimate of the channel at the receiving terminals. This initial channel estimate is utilized to decode the data in the first several time slots of each coherence interval. Data- aided approaches are then employed to improve the channel estimates in the following time slots of each coherence interval. The spectral efficiency improvement for systems employing this self-interference aided channel estimation scheme is quantified by comparing its achievable rates to that of the traditional pilot- aided channel estimation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917555","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917555.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable Rates of MIMO Bidirectional Broadcast Channels With Self-Interference Aided Channel Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Rates of MIMO Bidirectional Broadcast Channels With Self-Interference Aided Channel Estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917555/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646328","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917555/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable Rates of MIMO Bidirectional Broadcast Channels With Self-Interference Aided Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S32P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070895S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917558,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Guo","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab Key laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Guo","id":"37628536600"},{"name":"Tao Peng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab Key laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Peng","id":"37288452400"},{"name":"Yuan Qi","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab Key laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Qi","id":"37405517500"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab Key laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917558","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Delay","Monitoring","Switches","Communications Society","Adaptive signal processing","Laboratories","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","search problems","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive channel cluster-based searching scheme","cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","MAC-layer sensing","search delay minimization","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917558","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917558","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","abstract":"The MAC-layer sensing, as a key component of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio, concerns the sensing mechanism design to determine when to sense and access which channel.

Moreover, the optimization of these two schemes are also developed in this paper. By adaptive selecting the searching parameters according to the current environment, the average consumed time of channel searching can be minimized, while the searching quality is also satisfied.

In order to show the effectiveness of our proposal, a number of comparisons to the standard per-subcarrier receiver and a previously existing method are reported.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917584.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Receiver Architecture for Cyclic-Prefixed OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Computer architecture","Wireless LAN","Transmitters","Computational complexity","Robustness","Channel estimation","Redundancy","Interference cancellation","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","maximum likelihood detection","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","error-rate performance","computational complexity","channel estimation","maximum-likelihood detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Receiver Architecture for Cyclic-Prefixed OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917584/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646357","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Receiver Architecture for Cyclic-Prefixed OFDM","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S19P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045917S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917589,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Shen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Tech. & Telecom., Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Shen","id":"37394691600"},{"name":"Taiping Cui","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Tech. & Telecom., Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taiping","lastName":"Cui","id":"37595605400"},{"name":"Kyungsup Kwak","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Tech. & Telecom., Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungsup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"},{"name":"Chengshi Zhao","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengshi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37396943400"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278615200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917589","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Relays","Testing","Statistical analysis","Energy measurement","Iterative algorithms","Interference","Detectors","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","iterative methods","spread spectrum communication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal soft fusion scheme","cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","Neyman-Pearson framework","deflection coefficient","global test statistic","iterative algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an optimal soft fusion scheme for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) network. Multiple cooperative secondary users (SUs) simply serve as relay nodes in the network to provide space diversity for spectrum sensing. An optimal soft fusion scheme of the relayed sensing observations is derived in Neyman-Pearson framework, on the basis of maximizing the deflection coefficient of the global test statistic at the fusion center. However, the proposed fusion scheme requires instantaneous measurements of the received PU signal strengths in SUs with high accuracy, which are extremely difficult to obtain in an energy detection based spectrum sensing scenario. An iterative algorithm is therefore proposed to perform the estimation of the received PU signal strengths. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed optimal soft fusion scheme can significantly improve the spectrum sensing performance and the estimate algorithm can effectively approach the ideal performance of the proposed optimal fusion scheme.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917589","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917589.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917589","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimal Soft Fusion Scheme for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Optimal Soft Fusion Scheme for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917589/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917589/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646362","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimal Soft Fusion Scheme for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Network","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S20P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064342S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4917593,"authors":[{"name":"Zhonghao Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38184144600"},{"name":"Baojin Li","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Baojin","lastName":"Li","id":"37292491800"},{"name":"Yongyu Chang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongyu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292169600"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37281508500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917593","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel receiver consists of the Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) canceller and the turbo equalizer for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over frequency selective fading channels where the multipath delay exceeds the guard interval duration.

We characterize the secrecy rate when source, destination, relay and eavesdropper all use single antenna and the channel conditions are fix. Both AF and DF cooperative strategies are proved theoretically to be able to facilitate secure communication. Detailed analysis of AF and DF scheme reveals a trade off between secrecy area and request secrecy rate. In addition, secrecy constraints in cooperative secure communication are discussed and are used to explain the differences in AF and DF scheme. Overall, our work establishes the utility of cooperation and compares each advantage of AF and DF scheme in facilitating secure communication over wireless channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917597/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10646370","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917597/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing Amplify-and-Forward and Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Strategies in Wyner's Channel Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing Amplify-and-Forward and Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Strategies in Wyner's Channel Model","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S01P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060548S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4917604,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Couillet","affiliation":["ST-NXP Wireless/Sup\u00e9lec, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Couillet","id":"37546137300"},{"name":"Sebastian Wagner","affiliation":["ST-NXP Wireless/Sup\u00e9lec, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37534218200"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["Sup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917604","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","MIMO","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Communications Society","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Antenna theory","Physics","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast antennas","broadcast channels","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic analysis","correlated multiantenna broadcast channels","MIMO broadcast channel","transmitter","receiver","regularized zero-forcing precoders","volume-limited devices","dense antenna packing","random matrix theory","ergodic sum rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917604","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917604","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","abstract":"In this paper we consider the MIMO broadcast channel with antenna correlation at the transmitter and receiver.

Among the joint transmission designs for base station (BS) cooperation, the linear joint transmissions with per-base power constraint is preferred due to its computational simplicity and reality. However, since the transmissions with per-base power constraint sometimes make BSs cannot fully utilize their usable power, it leads considerable capacity loss. In this paper, we propose a BS selection technique for MMSE joint transmitter in downlink cooperative MIMO system to relive the inefficient usage of power under per-base power constraint. To find the BS group which yields the highest capacity, we compare the system capacity of all the possible BS groups. Simulation results show that the BS selection significantly improves the system capacity compared to the conventional linear joint transmissions by overcoming the aforementioned power allocation problem.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917607","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917607.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Base Station Selection Technique for MMSE Joint Transmission in Downlink Cooperative MIMO System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Base Station Selection Technique for MMSE Joint Transmission in Downlink Cooperative MIMO System","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917607/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646380","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917607/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base Station Selection Technique for MMSE Joint Transmission in Downlink Cooperative MIMO System","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S10P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059721S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4917608,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Cai","id":"37391393400"},{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37406909900"},{"name":"Yik-Chung Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yik-Chung","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281222900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917608","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems using Bayesian method.

Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effects of employing different prior information on the estimation performances.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917608.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian CFO Estimation in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Timing","Wireless LAN","Communications Society","Frequency synchronization","Channel estimation","Digital video broadcasting","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","frequency estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian CFO estimation","OFDM system","carrier frequency offset estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","noise variance","maximum a posteriori estimator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian CFO Estimation in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917608/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646381","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian CFO Estimation in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S41P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086459S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917609,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Couillet","affiliation":["ST-NXP Wireless, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Couillet","id":"37546137300"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["Sup\u00e9lec3 rue Joliot-Curie, Alcatel-Lucent, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917609","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Receiving antennas","Signal detection","Detectors","MIMO","Additive white noise","Signal processing","Gaussian noise","AWGN","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","cognitive radio","information theory","MIMO communication","radio receivers","signal detection","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian inference","multiple antenna cognitive receiver","Bayesian learning","cognitive device","signal detection","communication channel","information theoretic criterion","noisy wireless MIMO communication","transmit antenna","noise power","wireless device"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917609","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917609.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Inference for Multiple Antenna Cognitive Receivers","abstract":"In this paper, we provide a Bayesian learning process for cognitive devices.

The SUs share the same spectrum with a primary user (PU) while maintaining the interference power at the PU under a certain level. In order to enhance the achievable sum rate, the cognitive RS exploits the channel state information (CSI) of channel links from the RS to PU and from the RS to SUs to determine the relay beamforming (BF) and the transmit power levels for the RS and SUs. The structures of the optimal relay BF and suboptimal BF schemes based on the subspace projection are presented. Both orthogonal and non-orthogonal projection are considered. In addition, power control algorithms are proposed to satisfy the transmit power constraints as well as the interference power constraints. Numerical results are provided to compare the performance of the optimal relay BF with that of the suboptimal ones and also to justify the benefit of the optimal power allocation.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917611","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917611.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming and Power Control for Multi-Antenna Cognitive Two-Way Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917611/","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming and Power Control for Multi-Antenna Cognitive Two-Way Relaying","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646384","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917611/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming and Power Control for Multi-Antenna Cognitive Two-Way Relaying","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S21P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066849S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917612,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond H.

In this paper, we study algorithms to estimate these multiple CFO values. We first derive the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator and show that the complexity of the ML estimator increases exponentially with the number of users so that the estimator is not suitable for practical implementations. To reduce the complexity, we propose a sub-optimal algorithm using constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences. The complexity of the proposed method increases only linearly with the number of users. Using computer simulations, we compare the performance using CAZAC training sequences with that using the m sequence and the short training field (STF) of the IEEE 802.11n systems. The results show that in the low to medium SNR regions, the performance using CAZAC sequences is very close to the single-user Cramer-Rao bound. For high SNR regions, an error floor exists due to multiple access interference (MAI). The error floor using CAZAC sequences is more than 10 times smaller compared to the error floor using the other two sequences.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917620","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917620.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for Multi-User MIMO OFDM Uplink Using CAZAC Sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917620/","displayDocTitle":"Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for Multi-User MIMO OFDM Uplink Using CAZAC Sequences","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646393","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917620/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for Multi-User MIMO OFDM Uplink Using CAZAC Sequences","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S41P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051397S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917622,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Ni","affiliation":["Nokia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Ni","id":"37629561200"},{"name":"Haifeng Wang","affiliation":["Nokia"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280093100"},{"name":"Zhenhong Li","affiliation":["Nokia"],"firstName":"Zhenhong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279074600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917622","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Job shop scheduling","Relays","Throughput","Telecommunication traffic","Time division multiplexing","Communications Society","Couplings","Art","Peer to peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","OFDM modulation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["centralized proportional fair scheduling","concurrent transmission","wireless multi-hop OFDMA networks","overhead reduction","channel quality information"]}],"abstract":"The paper proposes the scheduling method to not only implement the proportional fairness between terminal users but also improve spectral efficiency by enabling concurrent transmission (CT) in wireless multi-hop OFDMA networks.

Receivers for WCDMA are usually implemented as Rake receivers or variants of it. Such receivers require accurate estimation of complex gains of multipaths received. Pilot symbols are provided as part of DPCCH channel and can be used for pilot-aided estimation of multipath complex gains. However the pilot symbols are in time-multiplexed form i.e. not transmitted continuously in time. Also, for channels corresponding to high vehicular speeds, the coherence time of channel is very low. Hence the accurate estimation of channel taps with granularity as fine as 2 chips becomes a complex task. We present here a method of channel estimation based on interference-compensated cubic smoothing splines. This method has been found to be robust to additive noise, while at the same time able to closely track the channel variations with fine granularity. The smoothing splines are a variant of least-squares splines, but with added constraints on smoothness. A comparison of the proposed method with alternative methods of channel estimation is also presented.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917624.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917624","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917624","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917624","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","RAKE receivers","Smoothing methods","3G mobile communication","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Multipath channels","Coherence","Interference","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel estimation","cochannel interference","code division multiple access","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","radio access networks","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","time-multiplexed pilot","HSUPA uplink","high speed uplink packet access","UMTS","3GPP","WCDMA","interference-compensated cubic smoothing spline","least-squares spline"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917624/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation Using Time-Multiplexed Pilots in HSUPA Uplink","accessionNumber":"10646397","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917624/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation Using Time-Multiplexed Pilots in HSUPA Uplink","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S08P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047356S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917627,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Lei","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Lei","id":"37593754900"},{"name":"Wen Gao","affiliation":["Thomson Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37275736600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917627","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"abstract":"Recently, the universality of a well-designed LDPC code ensemble has been recognized. Take the DVB standards for example. The structured LDPC codes originally developed for satellite communications have been reused in terrestrial and cable channels. To this end, a bit interleaver can be employed to adapt the profile of the given code to the variation of channel conditions. In this paper, we focus on the design of code-dependent bit interleavers for parallel non-uniform channels. Since the channel- dependence of a given code ensemble is dominated by the mutual information between the channel input and output, we propose to simplify the analysis about the decoding behavior by using a set of surrogate binary erasure channels (BEC). The approximation of the actual channel by the surrogate BEC is established on the equivalence of bitwise capacities, which represent the mutual information between the uniformly-distributed binary input and the likelihood ratios of the effective parallel AWGN channels. Moreover, the transition of the erasure probabilities is modeled by a linear difference equation around the decoding threshold SNR, from which we can derive a necessary condition on the convergence of decoding iterations and achieve a useful guideline for the configuration of the bit interleavers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917627.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-Matched Interleaver Design over Surrogate Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Mutual information","Iterative decoding","Digital video broadcasting","Satellite communication","Communication cables","Information analysis","AWGN channels","Difference equations","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","interleaved codes","parity check codes","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code-matched interleaver design","surrogate channels","LDPC codes","satellite communications","binary erasure channels","AWGN channels","decoding threshold"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Code-Matched Interleaver Design over Surrogate Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917627/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646400","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-Matched Interleaver Design over Surrogate Channels","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S45P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055235S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4917629,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfei Chen","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281026600"},{"name":"Norman C.

Unlike previous works that assume perfect knowledge of the average channel signal-to-noise ratio, this paper considers the realistic case where estimation of the average channel signal-to-noise ratio has error. Furthermore, while previous works have designed and examined estimators based on assuming that the channel samples used in the average signal-to-noise ratio estimators are noiseless, the present work assumes that the channel samples are noisy, as is the case in practical systems. Numerical results show that the probability of missed opportunity decreases as the estimation error decreases, as expected. Perhaps unexpectedly, the results also show that in the presence of noise, there exists a threshold phenomenon for the noise level. Below a particular threshold, the probability of missed opportunity increases as the noise level increases.

Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the localization accuracy greatly, especially when only few one-bound scattering paths exist.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917631","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917631.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined AOA and TOA NLOS Localization With Nonlinear Programming in Severe Multipath Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917631/","displayDocTitle":"Combined AOA and TOA NLOS Localization With Nonlinear Programming in Severe Multipath Environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646404","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917631/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined AOA and TOA NLOS Localization With Nonlinear Programming in Severe Multipath Environments","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T03S10P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064022S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4917634,"authors":[{"name":"Taneli Riihonen","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Taneli","lastName":"Riihonen","id":"37392216400"},{"name":"Stefan Werner","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Werner","id":"37267643700"},{"name":"Risto Wichman","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Risto","lastName":"Wichman","id":"37269114900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917634","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Power system relaying","Directive antennas","Mobile communication","Transmitting antennas","Communications Society","Guidelines","Channel capacity","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cochannel interference","relays","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-duplex mode","half-duplex modes","fixed amplify-and-forward relay","fundamental capacity trade-off","full-duplex transmission mode","half-duplex transmission modes","two-hop communication system","closed-form expressions","end-to-end capacity","relay link","channel resources","orthogonal channel allocation","maximum loop interference","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"We study the fundamental capacity trade-off between full-duplex and half-duplex transmission modes in a two- hop communication system with a fixed infrastructure-based amplify-and-forward relay.

This relaying transmission creates spatial diversity to combat the effect of individual severe fading and path loss. Since cooperative users utilize some degree of their transmission freedom for relaying other user's data, cooperative transmission results in lowering each user's transmission spectral efficiency. Therefore, a coding scheme with high spectral efficiency and optimized performance would be desirable for a cooperative network. This paper proposes the Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) scheme to be incorporated with the cooperative Amplify-and- Forward (AF) systems. A criterion for designing good TCM codes for AF systems is also derived and two cooperative AF systems achieving 1 bits/sec/Hz and 1.5 bits/sec/Hz for each user are presented. Analyses in this paper show that cooperative TCM schemes can not only achieve high spectral efficiency, but also outperform convolutional codes with a high order modulation scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","Channel coding","Fading","Diversity methods","Communication networks","Convolutional codes","Digital relays","Decoding","Transmitting antennas","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","diversity reception","trellis coded modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis coded modulation","cooperative communication network","cooperative amplify-and-forward system","spatial diversity","convolutional code","high order modulation scheme"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917641","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917641.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Amplify-and-Forward with Trellis Coded Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Amplify-and-Forward with Trellis Coded Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917641/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917641/","accessionNumber":"10646414","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Amplify-and-Forward with Trellis Coded Modulation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S01P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039605S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4917650,"authors":[{"name":"Faouzi Bellili","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Faouzi","lastName":"Bellili","id":"37391785500"},{"name":"Alex Stephenne","affiliation":["Ericsson Canada, Montreal, QUE, Canada","INRS-EMT, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Stephenne","id":"37294239900"},{"name":"Sofiene Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofiene","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917650","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"abstract":"In this paper, we derive analytical expressions for the inphase/quadrature Cramer-Rao lower bounds (I/Q CRLB) for the non-data-aided (NDA) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation of square quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals.

This cross layer design scheme, between the physical and data link layer, provides BER and throughput improvements over traditional Coded Cooperation due to the fact that in some cases the base station has already decoded a particular set of information bits using a user's initially transmitted parity and not all parity bits are required. The user however is not informed by the base station of this, during Coded Cooperation. With the proposed cross layer design users can then transmit incremental parity packets and await feedback from the base station to decide whether further parity is required for a particular set of information bits. Improvements in Bit Error Rate (BER) and throughput are observed by the cross layer design over Coded Cooperation. BER theoretical bound analysis is performed and is validated by simulations in a block fading channel.

Thus, to attain a more realistic resolution our cross-layer design determines optimal subcarrier and power allocation policies based on partial CSIT and individual user's quality of service (QoS) requirements. The simulation results show that the proposed cross-layer scheduler can maximize the system's throughput and at the same time satisfy heterogeneous delay requirements of various users with significant low power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking

The key idea of the decoder is to use correctly decoded frames as an aid for correcting the remaining erroneous frames. To accomplish this, the decoder exchanges the relevant information between layers by using the cross-layer design method and an iterative decoding architecture. Moreover, the unequal-error protection (UEP) property of irregular LDPC is exploited and both the multiple-error detection and single-error correction capabilities of the CRC code are used. Simulation results show that the proposed decoder outperforms the pure sum-product algorithm (SPA) decoder by a considerable gain while the increase in complexity is moderate. Furthermore, the error floor of irregular LDPC codes in the high Eb/NO regime can be lowered effectively. The proposed cross-layer iterative decoder can be used for any irregular LDPC coded wireless system to boost the performance and lower the error floor.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917653","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917653.pdf","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917653/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Iterative Decoding of Irregular LDPC Codes using Cyclic Redundancy Check Codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917653/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10646426","publicationDate":"April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Iterative Decoding of Irregular LDPC Codes using Cyclic Redundancy Check Codes","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S37P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079068S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4917655,"authors":[{"name":"Saqib Ali","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Saqib","lastName":"Ali","id":"38252896100"},{"name":"F.

Since ICIC is performed at each mobile station (MS), the proposed ASE scheme can be classified as a decentralized ICIC scheme. Compared to conventional centralized ICIC schemes, our proposed decentralized ASE scheme has the following advantages: cell and user coordinations are easier in the proposed ASE scheme, the complexity of ICIC at base stations (BSs) is reduced, and frequency selectivity characteristics of interference channels to neighboring base stations can be utilized in ICIC. Using the ASE scheme, each MS first finds which neighboring BS suffers most from the interference induced by the MS. Then, it determines an exclusion ratio alpha according to how much intercell interference the MS induces to the selected BS. Finally, it excludes alpha of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) sub-bands under the consideration of the frequency characteristics of the channel between the selected BS and itself. Through extensive computer simulations, we show that the proposed ASE scheme is effective in improving cell edge user performance by eight times at a reasonable degradation of average user performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917658/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10646431","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917658/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Intercell Interference Coordination in Uplink Cellular Networks using Adaptive Sub-Band Exclusion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Intercell Interference Coordination in Uplink Cellular Networks using Adaptive Sub-Band Exclusion","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S05P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048381S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917659,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Upon detecting the primary network being idle, each CR user employs a modified 802.11 DCF protocol for contention-based channel access. Spectrum sensing is imperfect and introduces false alarms and mis-detections. To protect primary users, it is required that the combined probability of mis-detection of all CR users must be below a specified threshold.

For rateless coding, we consider a protocol that transmits new parity packets during retransmission and show that this scheme is stable if the jamming rate of the system is within a certain range. For both anti-jamming coding schemes, the corresponding simple ARQ protocols provide significant improvement in secondary user throughput. Moreover, the piecewise coding together with its ARQ protocol offers similar or better throughput performance compared with the rateless coding counterpart, without incurring the stability issue.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10646440","htmlLink":"/document/4917667/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of Efficient ARQ Schemes with Anti-Jamming Coding for Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Efficient ARQ Schemes with Anti-Jamming Coding for Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S21P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080495S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917668,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Jiang","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Research Institute, UK"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37270835600"},{"name":"Alain Mourad","affiliation":["Electronics Research Institute, UK"],"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Mourad","id":"37395520700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917668","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Throughput","Robustness","Samarium","Matrix decomposition","Design methodology","Space time codes","Reflection","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","genetic algorithms","linear codes","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","radio access networks","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear dispersion code","MIMO broadband wireless access system","link throughput","link robustness","multiple input multiple output system","unitary matrix theory","genetic algorithm","LDC design","data rate","error protection"]}],"abstract":"Linear dispersion codes (LDCs) are capable of achieving a good trade-off between link throughput and link robustness in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) broadband wireless access systems.

Nonlinear analog parts cause, however, impairments in the beamforming. In this paper we show that when the separate antenna elements include nonlinear amplifiers with different amplitude modulation to amplitude modulation (AM-AM) and amplitude modulation to phase modulation (AM- PM) conversions, there are errors in the level of main beam and in the direction of the main beam, respectively. There are no impairments in the beamforming if there is phase noise at the input of the antenna array. Anyhow, the phase noise may dramatically distort the signal constellation. A common method to avoid nonlinear distortions is to use modulation which has constant envelope. This is not enough if the nonlinear amplifier has memory.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917670","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917670.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917670","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Signal Design and Nonlinear Distortions in Antenna Array Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Digital Signal Design and Nonlinear Distortions in Antenna Array Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917670/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917670/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646443","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Signal Design and Nonlinear Distortions in Antenna Array Beamforming","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S36P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095832S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4917674,"authors":[{"name":"Prashanth Hande","affiliation":["Qualcomm Flarion Technologies, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Prashanth","lastName":"Hande","id":"37295655300"},{"name":"Shailesh Patil","affiliation":["Qualcomm Flarion Technologies, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Shailesh","lastName":"Patil","id":"37631531400"},{"name":"Hyung G.

A major factor contributing to the efficiency and stability of the network is the mechanism determining the connection of terminals to the appropriate AP and the RF carrier. This paper describes a practical, distributed, network-assisted and terminal-driven mechanism to determine the connections for load-balancing among the available RF carriers. The mechanism is based on a metric that we term as the service level indicating metric (SLIM). We extend the notion of SLIM to cases where Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters are specified and propose a load-balancing mechanism for such cases. We demonstrate the near-optimality of the proposed mechanisms through 3GPP based simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917674.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Load-Balancing in a Multi-Carrier Wireless System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Wireless LAN","Bandwidth","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Wireless networks","Next generation networking","Communications Society","USA Councils","Stability","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","quality of service","radio networks","resource allocation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed load-balancing","multi-carrier wireless system","cellular network","wireless local area network","WLAN","attachment points","multiple radiofrequency carriers","service level indicating metric","quality-of-service","3GPP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Load-Balancing in a Multi-Carrier Wireless System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917674/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646447","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Load-Balancing in a Multi-Carrier Wireless System","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S20P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04717S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4917676,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Hui","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi''an University of Technology, Xi'an, China","School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Hui","id":"37411811000"},{"name":"Shihua Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shihua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281408500"},{"name":"Guobing Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guobing","lastName":"Li","id":"37634094400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917676","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power system relaying","Fading","Channel state information","Wireless networks","Power engineering and energy","Communications Society","Automation","Decoding","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency interference","telecommunication signalling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward cooperative relay networks","channel state information","target outage probability","single relay power allocation scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917676","abstract":"In this paper, distributed power allocation schemes are studied for amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative relay networks, where only partial channel state information (CSI) is available at the source and relays.

We address the problem of characterizing the downlink capacity with the generalized assumptions: (al) per distributed antenna power constraint, (a2) generalized mobile terminals equipped with multiple antennas, (a3) a multi-cell environment. Based on system scale-up, we derive a good approximation of the ergodic downlink capacity by adopting random matrix theory.

The approximation is illustrated to be quite accurate and the iterative method is verified to be quite efficient by Monte Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Capacity of Distributed Antenna Systems in a Multi-Cell Environment","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917683","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917683.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Capacity of Distributed Antenna Systems in a Multi-Cell Environment","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917683/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646456","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Capacity of Distributed Antenna Systems in a Multi-Cell Environment","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S34P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052972S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4917688,"authors":[{"name":"Shamik Sengupta","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Shamik","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"37288180900"},{"name":"Mainak Chatterjee","affiliation":["School of EECS, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Mainak","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37278542600"},{"name":"Kevin Kwiat","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Kwiat","id":"37282220700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917688","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":238},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917688","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Mesh networks","Centralized control","Military communication","Network topology","Peer to peer computing","FCC","Switches","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic spectrum access","cognitive radio","tactical mesh network","spectral efficiency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917688","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917688.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio based Tactical Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate how cognitive radio (CR) enabled devices can self-organize to form a tactical mesh network and operate on non-dedicated (secondary) spectrum.

Although a flexible network can be realized by using multi-hop communication, a hidden node problem occurs between the links in the self flow and degrades the end-to-end throughput performance. As one of the solution of the hidden terminal problem, a TDMA multi- hop wireless network is considered. In TDMA multi-hop wireless network, the transmitting timing can be controlled not to give the interference toward the other links of the self flow. However, the data rate from the source node to the destination node of a fixed TDMA frame size is limited by the lowest quality link with small transmittable bits. As a result, the performance improvement by reducing the interference degrades. In this paper, the dynamic subcarrier assignment method is applied to reduce the effect of bottleneck link of TDMA wireless multi-hop networks. The proposed method can decide the used subcarriers by combining with a routing for establishing the multi-hop network.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917689","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917689.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Subcarrier Controlled TDMA/OFDM Multi-Hop Wireless Network for Improving End to End Throughput","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917689/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Subcarrier Controlled TDMA/OFDM Multi-Hop Wireless Network for Improving End to End Throughput","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646462","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917689/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Subcarrier Controlled TDMA/OFDM Multi-Hop Wireless Network for Improving End to End Throughput","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S14P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035976S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917690,"authors":[{"name":"Hye J.

In multiple input-multiple output and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems, the per subcarrier on per antenna feedback induces a substantial amount of feedback overload and requires high computational complexity. This paper addresses the channel quality information (CQI) quantization and feedback strategies for resolving this problem. First, a quantization method is proposed by quantized values indicating the modulation level instead of the full values of CQI. A close-form expression of the achievable spectrum efficiency is obtained and shows no loss compared with perfect CQI. Secondly, three partial feedback approaches are proposed in order to reduce the amount of CQI feedback at the expense of slight decrease of spectrum efficiency, named opportunistic, best and hybrid feedback respectively. Finally, extensive simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of feedback strategy. The results indicate that hybrid feedback combined with the proposed quantization method performs best in comparison with other schemes. In this case, the feedback overload can be greatly reduced without compromising the multiuser diversity gain, as long as a proper choice of the strategy parameters is executed.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917697","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Channel Quantization and Feedback Strategies for Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Channel Quantization and Feedback Strategies for Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917697/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646470","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917697/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Channel Quantization and Feedback Strategies for Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S27P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033776S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","articleId":"4917697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917698,"authors":[{"name":"Deepaknath Tandur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Deepaknath","lastName":"Tandur","id":"37646146900"},{"name":"Chong-You Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chong-You","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406332400"},{"name":"Marc Moonen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moonen","id":"37274397700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917698","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","OFDM","Equalizers","Frequency estimation","Convergence","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Frequency domain analysis","Sociotechnical systems","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","OFDM modulation","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","radio frequency impairment","inphase imbalance","quadrature-phase imbalance","carrier frequency offset","time domain equalizer","frequency domain equalizer","frequency-domain smoothing technique","transmitter RF impairment","receiver RF impairment"]}],"abstract":"OFDM based systems are very sensitive to radio frequency (RF) impairments such as in-phase/quadrature-phase (IQ) imbalance and carrier frequency offset (CFO). In this paper, a generally applicable joint transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) RF impairment compensation scheme is proposed. It is composed of a time domain equalizer (TEQ) and two frequency domain equalizers (FEQ). The TEQ utilizes the short training symbols (STS) to estimate and compensate the frequency selective Rx IQ imbalance along with the CFO. The two FEQs then work on the specially induced phase rotated long training symbols (LTS) in order to compensate the remaining Tx or the combined Tx and Rx IQ imbalance along with the channel. A frequency-domain smoothing technique is also utilized in order to further speed up the convergence of the equalizers. The resulting cascade of equalizers provide an efficient compensation scheme in terms of both computational complexity as well as faster convergence.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917698","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917698.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Compensation of RF Impairments for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917698/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Compensation of RF Impairments for OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646471","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917698/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Compensation of RF Impairments for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S22P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049338S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4917702,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed N.

The performance evaluated over a realistic channel model shows the efficiency of this technique which turns out to be a promising MIMO channel estimation technique for the future mobile video broadcasting systems.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917703","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917703.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Space Code Block Code MIMO Channel Estimation for Future Mobile Video Broadcasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917703/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Space Code Block Code MIMO Channel Estimation for Future Mobile Video Broadcasting","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646476","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917703/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Space Code Block Code MIMO Channel Estimation for Future Mobile Video Broadcasting","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S08P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04605S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917704,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungsoo Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University (ICU), Daejeon, KOREA"],"firstName":"Hyungsoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37634722900"},{"name":"Hyounkuk Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University (ICU), Daejeon, KOREA"],"firstName":"Hyounkuk","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292783900"},{"name":"Namshik Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea","Smart Radio Research Team, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, KOREA"],"firstName":"Namshik","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279220700"},{"name":"Hyuncheol Park","affiliation":["Smart Radio Research Team, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, KOREA"],"firstName":"Hyuncheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37277121400"},{"name":"Seok Seo","affiliation":["Smart Radio Research Team, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea","School of Engineering, Information and Communications University (ICU), Daejeon, KOREA"],"firstName":"Seok","lastName":"Seo","id":"37086906759"},{"name":"Jinkyu Choi","affiliation":["Smart Radio Research Team, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea","School of Engineering, Information and Communications University (ICU), Daejeon, KOREA"],"firstName":"Jinkyu","lastName":"Choi","id":"37086355278"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917704","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Linear antenna arrays","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate","Diversity methods","Error probability","Communications Society","Wireless communication","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","communication complexity","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","radiocommunication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit antenna selection","correlated MIMO channels","wireless communication","Poincare separation theorem","Monte-Carlo simulation complexity"]}],"abstract":"While multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system gives many advantages to wireless communication, the complexity of multiple RF chains gives a burden to the system. Antenna selection is introduced as a technique to reduce the burden. On the transmit antenna selection scheme, the exhaustive search for optimal antenna set quickly becomes impractical as adopting more antennas. To reduce complexity for searching, we propose an efficient transmit antenna selection method. We first make a threshold for optimal antenna set by using Poincare separation theorem. Instead of exhaustive search, we select a transmit antenna subset that exceeds the threshold. On the exponentially correlated channel of array antennas, we give an order to search for reducing complexity further. We search from the most remotely located antenna subset which in generally less correlated to the closely located antennas which is more correlated. Finally, we show the BER performance and tradeoff relation between performance and complexity by Monte-Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917704","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917704.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Transmit Antenna Selection for Correlated MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917704/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Transmit Antenna Selection for Correlated MIMO Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646477","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917704/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Transmit Antenna Selection for Correlated MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S02P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072693S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917722,"authors":[{"name":"Yasuyuki Hatakawa","affiliation":["KDDI Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuyuki","lastName":"Hatakawa","id":"37282451600"},{"name":"Noriaki Miyazaki","affiliation":["KDDI Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriaki","lastName":"Miyazaki","id":"37302165000"},{"name":"Toshinori Suzuki","affiliation":["KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshinori","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37276138400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917722","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":36,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917722","abstract":"This paper presents field experiments on open-loop precoding multiple input multiple output (MIMO) using a testbed targeting International Mobile Telecommunication - Advanced (IMT-Advanced) systems. Open-loop MIMO is realized by applying Rotational OFDM (R-OFDM) to MIMO transmission. MIMO R-OFDM is more robust with respect to correlated channels than conventional open-loop MIMO-OFDM as was shown by the authors in a previous study. MIMO R-OFDM is implemented in a testbed targeting IMT-Advanced systems and is evaluated in a mobile environment. The antenna spacings are changed, i.e. the correlation coefficients between two antennas are changed, then the validity of MIMO R-OFDM is evaluated. The results of the field experiment reveal that MIMO R-OFDM is effective when the transmitter antenna spacings are decreased. The maximum cumulative distribution function (CDF) gain of MIMO R-OFDM with respect to conventional MIMO-OFDM is 6 % when the antenna spacing of the transmitter is same as the wave length of the carrier. In addition, it was also found that the rotational angle should be determined based not only on modulation order and coding rate, but also on the correlation coefficients between transmitter and receiver antennas.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917722","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917722.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field Experiments on Open-Loop Precoding MIMO Using Testbed Targeted at IMT-Advanced System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","System testing","Radio transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Receivers","Bit error rate","Modulation coding","Downlink","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","correlation methods","MIMO communication","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","precoding","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open-loop precoding scheme","multiple input multiple output system","MIMO system","International Mobile Telecommunication system","IMT-advanced system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","rotational OFDM system","correlated channel","transmitting antenna","cumulative distribution function","receiving antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Field Experiments on Open-Loop Precoding MIMO Using Testbed Targeted at IMT-Advanced System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917722/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646495","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Experiments on Open-Loop Precoding MIMO Using Testbed Targeted at IMT-Advanced System","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S44P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050558S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4917729,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojing Huang","affiliation":["Wireless Technologies Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293558100"},{"name":"Y.

For space preceding, different preceding matrices selected from a predefined orthogonal matrix are used to allocate each frequency precoded data symbol to all transmit antennas to gain spatial diversity. The number of substreams and the corresponding data symbol mapping scheme are also adaptively determined at the receiver under varying received signal strength and MIMO channel conditions, and are made available to the transmitter through a low-rate feedback channel.

Using the conventional time reversal (TR) technique along with a specific OFDM symbol structure, the method facilitates the application of full-rate orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) to systems with more than two transmit antennas for complex signalling. Compared to the conventional eigen- beamforming method, which maximizes the received signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) when CSIT is available, it is shown that the proposed system has a much reduced computational complexity. However, this complexity reduction comes at the expense of a loss of diversity in an uncoded system, which we show through an analysis of bit error rate (BER).

We analyze the performance gain in terms of the symbol error probability (SEP) in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Similarly as in the single relay case [1], under a specific modulation scheme, these gains only depend on the ratio of channel mean power between the first-hop and second-hop transmission. In particular, we show that the HDAF protocol obtains a large gain, medium gain, and small gain over ADF, AF as the relays are placed close to the destination, half-way between the source and destination (symmetric case), and nearby the source, respectively. In contrast to the single-relay case in which the HDAF scheme has no benefit compared to ADF and AF as the relay is located close to the source [1], HDAF still achieves a small gain with multiple relays. Interestingly, we further show that for all cases the performance gains are saturated as the number of relays is large.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917740","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917740.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Decode-Amplify-Forward Cooperative Communications with Multiple Relays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Decode-Amplify-Forward Cooperative Communications with Multiple Relays","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917740/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646513","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917740/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Decode-Amplify-Forward Cooperative Communications with Multiple Relays","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S11P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040574S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4917741,"authors":[{"name":"Nikhil Shetty","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Shetty","id":"37408681800"},{"name":"Sofie Pollin","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium","Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sofie","lastName":"Pollin","id":"37271990100"},{"name":"Przemyslaw Pawelczak","affiliation":["Department of EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Przemyslaw","lastName":"Pawelczak","id":"37398059000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917741","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","System identification","Wireless LAN","Wideband","Bluetooth","Communications Society","USA Councils","Radiofrequency identification","Frequency measurement","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","pattern clustering","sampling methods","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum usage identification","machine learning","wireless system identification","dynamic radio environment","heterogeneous usage","spectrum use-center frequency","frequency spread-and cluster","unsupervised clustering method","Chinese restaurant process","Gibbs sampling","online classification","training phase"]}],"abstract":"We adopt a machine learning approach towards the problem of identifying wireless systems present in a dynamic radio environment with heterogeneous usage.

The heuristic algorithms based on initial subcarrier assignment and iterative improvement two steps have been proposed by Wong et al. and Chen et al. for real-time services [4-5]. However, an appropriate method for the initial assignment should be selected or designed to offer even better performance. In this paper, one subcarrier allocation algorithm proposed by Zhang [6] is adopted as an initial subcarrier assignment method for the allocation problem. Its advantage is that there is no need to pre-determine the number of the assigned subcarriers for each user, and it outperforms the constructive initial assignment method proposed by Wong et al.. We adopt the subcarrier allocation algorithm proposed by Zhang along with iterative improvement schemes to obtain better performance. Detailed discussions of the subcarrier allocation algorithm proposed by Zhang are presented in this paper. As indicated in the simulation results, it reveals that the better initial subcarrier assignment with the iterative improvement schemes achieves better performance. We utilize the linear integer programming-based branch-and-bound algorithm to provide the optimum solution as the performance bound. The simulation results show that the performance is improved with the new proposed heuristic polynomial time algorithm and is close to that of the optimum solution.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917749","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917749.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Schemes for Subcarrier, Bit, and Power Allocation in Multiuser OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917749/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Schemes for Subcarrier, Bit, and Power Allocation in Multiuser OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646522","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917749/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Schemes for Subcarrier, Bit, and Power Allocation in Multiuser OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S14P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034605S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917761,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmudur Rahman","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahmudur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37292338000"},{"name":"Halim Yanikomeroglu","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Halim","lastName":"Yanikomeroglu","id":"37280821200"},{"name":"William Wong","affiliation":["Communications Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Wong","id":"37633528300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917761","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1872},"abstract":"The investigation of co-channel interference mitigation techniques (such as, interference cancellation through receiver processing, interference randomization by frequency hopping, and interference avoidance through resource usage restrictions imposed by frequency and power planning) has become a key focus area in achieving dense spectrum reuse in next generation cellular systems such as 3GPP LTE, LTE- advanced, and WiMAX.

The time domain and proposed frequency domain EM based channel estimation algorithms are compared in terms of bit error rate (BER), mean square error (MSE) and the number of iterations used in the EM algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917765.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative EM-Based Channel Estimation for STBC-OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Iterative algorithms","Fading","Frequency domain analysis","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate","Intersymbol interference","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","channel estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","frequency-domain analysis","matrix inversion","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STBC-OFDM system","space time block code","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","iterative expectation maximisation","channel estimation algorithm","matrix inversion","frequency domain analysis","time domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Iterative EM-Based Channel Estimation for STBC-OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917765/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646538","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative EM-Based Channel Estimation for STBC-OFDM","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S17P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044578S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917766,"authors":[{"name":"Ville Syrjala","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Syrjala","id":"37304103300"},{"name":"Mikko Valkama","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Valkama","id":"37267657500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917766","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","OFDM","Sampling methods","AWGN","Phase noise","Receivers","Baseband","Signal mapping","Phase distortion","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","distortion","jitter","OFDM modulation","phase noise","radio receivers","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter mitigation","high-frequency bandpass-sampling","OFDM radio receiver","phase noise","signal distortion","AWGN","additive white Gaussian noise","extended ITU-R vehicular A multipath radio channel"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new way to address and mitigate sampling jitter in high-frequency bandpass-sampling OFDM radio receivers.

Due to the energy consumption in sensing the channels, the selfish users may not be willing to contribute to the cooperative sensing while they want to occupy more idle channels observed. To deal with this problem, we propose in this paper a game theoretic approach which will advocate users to spend power to sense the channel by using the access opportunity in the MAC layer as a payoff. In this protocol, the users who sense the channel are given higher priority to access the idle channel and meanwhile, the multiuser diversity in the MAC layer is exploited to increase the throughput for cognitive systems. The expressions for the average throughput and consumed power for a single user will be derived and then Nash equilibrium will be studied for the game model. It will be shown that the game will be characterized by the prisoner's dilemma. To guarantee the fairness and achieve higher throughput, we will design an evolutionary game protocol in which the Nash equilibrium can be dynamically changed based on the behaviors of cognitive users. Simulation results will show that the proposed protocol can achieve fairness and efficiency for cognitive users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917774/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10646547","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917774/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Joint Scheduling and Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radios: A Game Theoretic Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Scheduling and Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radios: A Game Theoretic Approach","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S07P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062703S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4917775,"authors":[{"name":"Fan-Shuo Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fan-Shuo","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37547008300"},{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Rong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280430600"},{"name":"Jwo-Yuh Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jwo-Yuh","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279156700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917775","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917775","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Upper bound","Protocols","Decoding","MIMO","Communications Society","Design engineering","Design methodology","Cooperative systems","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AF MIMO cooperative system","joint source/relay precoder matrices","amplify-and-forward relay system","MMSE criterion","minimum-mean- squared-error criterion","cooperative communication system","multiple antenna","direct minimization","MSE matrix","iterative water-filling technique"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Source/Relay Precoder Design in Amplify-and-Forward Relay Systems Using an MMSE Criterion","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917775","abstract":"This paper addresses the joint source/relay precoder design problem in amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative communication systems where multiple antennas are equipped at the source, the relay, and the destination. Existing solutions to the problem only consider the relay link and, thus, do not fully exploit all the available link resource. Using a minimum-mean- squared-error (MMSE) criterion, we propose a joint precoder design method, taking both the direct and relay links into account. It is shown that the MMSE is a highly nonlinear function of the precoder matrices, and a direct minimization is not feasible. To facilitate analysis, we propose to design the precoders toward first diagonalizing the MSE matrix of the relay link. This imposes certain structural constraints on both precoders that allow us to derive an analytically tractable MSE upper bound. By conducting minimization with respect to this upper bound, the solution can be obtained by an iterative water- filling technique. Simulations show that the proposed design can significantly enhance the performance of MIMO AF cooperative systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917775/","accessionNumber":"10646548","displayDocTitle":"Joint Source/Relay Precoder Design in Amplify-and-Forward Relay Systems Using an MMSE Criterion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Source/Relay Precoder Design in Amplify-and-Forward Relay Systems Using an MMSE Criterion","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S14P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095839S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4917776,"authors":[{"name":"E. del Castillo-Sanchez","affiliation":["Communication Engineering Department, ETSI Telecomunicacion, University of Malaga, Malaga, Spain"],"firstName":"E.","lastName":"del Castillo-Sanchez","id":"38272011100"},{"name":"F.

The value of this scaling factor lies in the individual power assigned to the transmit symbols prior the transmission. Such assignment will depend entirely on the matrix condition of the channel, in this case the eigenvalue's power of the channel inverse. Thus, the minimisation of this power constraint will rely on closing the power gap among the transmit symbols, and one solution is to use an auxiliary vector for fixing the matrix condition. This is equivalent to solving the integer least-squares problem. For achieving this specific goal there are two effective choices: the lattice-reduction, whose objective is to reduce the basis of any given matrix, and the sphere techniques which enumerate all the lattice points inside a sphere centered at the query point. Both choices aim for finding or fitting an approximated least-squares solution occasioning astonishing results in performance when minimising the scaling factor prior to transmit.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917778","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917778.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice-Reduction for Power Optimisation Using the Fast Least-Squares Solution-Seeker Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Lattice-Reduction for Power Optimisation Using the Fast Least-Squares Solution-Seeker Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10646551","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917778/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice-Reduction for Power Optimisation Using the Fast Least-Squares Solution-Seeker Algorithm","confLoc":"Budapest","sourcePdf":"T01S40P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049138S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4917785,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37635674700"},{"name":"Laurie Cuthbert","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Laurie","lastName":"Cuthbert","id":"37279686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917785","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":206},"abstract":"A load-based relay selection algorithm that improves the fairness of resource allocation is proposed for relay-based OFDMA systems. This algorithm takes into account the traffic load condition (bandwidth requirement) of relay link users and direct link users.

In the context of overlay spectrum sharing PSK is considered as the most appropriate mapping for the embedded symbol since it has no impact on the overall TDCS-CCSK power spectrum density. As each transmit antenna transmits different data, the bit rate of the proposed TDCS system becomes higher. The simulation results show that for the ratio between the number of the transmit antennas and the receive antennas of Vi or lower, the bit error rate (BER) performance improves significantly.

Mobile WiMAX is designed to support a wide range of different applications including media streaming, voice-over- IP (VoIP), video conferencing, and web browsing. All of these applications require different levels of quality of service (QoS) and this imposes a variety of different performance requirements on the WiMAX physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers. For example, TCP-based applications such as FTP or Web-browsing use automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) to tolerate a relatively high PHY packet error rate (PER), whilst a UDP-based application such as video streaming requires very low PER due to the lack of ARQ. This means that the same WiMAX system configuration needs to be able to provide different performance levels for different types of applications in order to operate efficiently. This paper analyses and compares the performance of a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) mobile WiMAX system in terms of achievable throughput and operating range for different PHY PER requirements. The paper shows that TCP applications can achieve higher throughputs and operating ranges due to higher PER tolerance. It also shows that this important QoS parameter affects the AMC switching points. Cross-layer interaction is required between the PHY and the scheduler in the MAC layer in order to efficiently fulfil the various QoS requirements at the application layer.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917808","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917808.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile WiMAX: MIMO Performance Analysis from a Quality of Service (QoS) Viewpoint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917808/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile WiMAX: MIMO Performance Analysis from a Quality of Service (QoS) Viewpoint","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646581","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917808/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile WiMAX: MIMO Performance Analysis from a Quality of Service (QoS) Viewpoint","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S23P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048192S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917813,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Bakr","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Bakr","id":"37277504300"},{"name":"Mark Johnson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37277459300"},{"name":"Raghuraman Mudumbai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Raghuraman","lastName":"Mudumbai","id":"37283520600"},{"name":"Kannan Ramchandran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kannan","lastName":"Ramchandran","id":"37270144500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917813","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":662},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Cognitive radio","Receivers","Radio transmitters","Array signal processing","Adaptive arrays","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Decoding","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","cognitive radio","interference suppression","iterative methods","radio links","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiantenna interference cancellation","multiantenna radio","cognitive radio systems","secondary radio transmitter","beamforming technique","antenna weights","secondary radio receiver","adaptive techniques","channel response","legacy systems","iterative method","accurate channel estimation","frequency division duplexed networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917813","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917813","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","abstract":"This paper presents a practical method for using multi-antenna radios to cancel interference in cognitive radio systems. Under this method, secondary radio transmitters use beamforming techniques to find antenna weights that place nulls at the primary receivers, and secondary radio receivers use adaptive techniques to decode in the presence of interference from primary users. As an example, we show how this scheme can be leveraged to effectively reuse the uplink band of a cellular network. However, estimating the channel responses, without causing interference and without requiring significant modifications to legacy systems, is a challenging problem. We provide an iterative method for accurate channel estimation in frequency division duplexed networks, where the uplink is independent of the downlink.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917813.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Antenna Interference Cancellation Techniques for Cognitive Radio Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917813/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Antenna Interference Cancellation Techniques for Cognitive Radio Applications","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646586","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Antenna Interference Cancellation Techniques for Cognitive Radio Applications","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S04P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053559S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917818,"authors":[{"name":"Yanyan Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37599077500"},{"name":"Jianhua Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293674400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917818","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Communication systems","Frequency","Oscillators","Degradation","Cooperative systems","Decoding","Euclidean distance","Interference elimination","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","diversity reception","error statistics","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple CFOs compensation","BER analysis","cooperative communication systems","multiple carrier frequency offsets","node oscillators","Doppler spreads","space-frequency block coded cooperative systems","MCFO compensation algorithm","SFBC decoder","minimum Euclidean distance decision criterion","interference reconstructing eliminator","bit error ratio","BER performance"]}],"abstract":"In cooperative communication systems, multiple carrier frequency offsets (MCFO) appear due to the different accuracy of the nodes' oscillators and Doppler spreads, which drastically degrades the performance of space-frequency block coded (SFBC) cooperative systems.

In this paper we consider a multi-rate system where high data- rate transmitters are constructed by combining several IDMA layers together, and transmitting the composite layered signal from a single antenna. Each layer is of equal rate, but unequal power. Assignment of different powers to the different layers has been shown to significantly improve the performance of iterative decoder receivers. Using Variance Transfer (VT) charts, we derive an optimal power allocation scheme for the IDMA layers.

Hence the proposed precoding technique based on GMUD achieves better performance than precoding based on singular value decomposition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917824/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646597","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-User SISO Precoding Based on Generalized Multi-Unitary Decomposition for Single-Carrier Transmission in Frequency Selective Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-User SISO Precoding Based on Generalized Multi-Unitary Decomposition for Single-Carrier Transmission in Frequency Selective Channel","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S26P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057807S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917825,"authors":[{"name":"Henning Vetter","affiliation":["Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Vetter","id":"37640976900"},{"name":"Vishakan Ponnampalam","affiliation":["Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vishakan","lastName":"Ponnampalam","id":"37269015400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917825","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Decoding","Communications Society","Europe","USA Councils","MIMO","Downlink","Base stations","Transmitting antennas","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","perturbation techniques","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near optimum vector perturbation precoding","lattice reduction aided vector perturbation","multi user MIMO downlink","closest lattice point approximation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917825","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917825.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Optimum Vector Perturbation Precoding Using a Candidate List","abstract":"An improvement to lattice-reduction-aided (LRA) vector perturbation preceding for multi-user MIMO downlink is introduced.

Pilot subcarrier usage is of great interest since it enables to discriminate OFDM systems that have the same modulation parameters (subcarrier spacing, cyclic prefix duration, etc.). The proposed method relies on the periodic redundancy often induced between pilot symbols.

In sub-band based OFDMA systems, users occupy consecutive and non-overlapping frequency sub-bands. The pilots are usually placed on the edges of a sub-band for channel estimation. However, the channel estimation performance is seriously degraded by the MUI. Traditionally, the MUI is alleviated by inserting a guard sub-carrier between adjacent users. In this paper, a novel pilot architecture is proposed, where three pilots are placed on each edge of a sub-band and pilots of adjacent users are overlapped. The proposed architecture has the same bandwidth efficiency as that of the conventional guard sub-carrier insertion scheme and provides better channel estimation performance and MUI reduction.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917846","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917846.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Pilot Design for Channel Estimation and MUI Reduction in Uplink OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917846/","displayDocTitle":"On Pilot Design for Channel Estimation and MUI Reduction in Uplink OFDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646619","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917846/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Pilot Design for Channel Estimation and MUI Reduction in Uplink OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S04P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047878S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917847,"authors":[{"name":"Danhua Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Danhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37404881600"},{"name":"Youzheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youzheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281422400"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278637500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917847","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"abstract":"This paper considers joint schedule and resource allocation in downlink cooperative OFDMA systems with multiple sources, multiple relays and a single destination.

channel for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Adopting an orthogonal pilot pattern for multiple transmitting antennas and assuming independent samples along the time, the sample auto-correlation matrix of the channel response is complex Wishart distributed. Then, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the analytic expression of CRLB are derived by assuming that temporal and frequency correlations are known. Furthermore, lower bounds of total mean squared error (TMSE) and average mean squared error (AvgMSE) are deduced from CRLB for asymptotically infinite and finite signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's), respectively. According to the lower bound of AvgMSE, the amount of samples and the order of frequency selectivity show dominant impact on the accuracy of estimation. Besides, the number of pilot tones, SNR and normalized maximum Doppler spread together influence the effective order frequency selectivity. Numerical simulations demonstrate the analytic results.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917851","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917851.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for Spatial Correlation Matrices of Doubly Selective Fading Channels for MIMO OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917851/","displayDocTitle":"On the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for Spatial Correlation Matrices of Doubly Selective Fading Channels for MIMO OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646624","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917851/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for Spatial Correlation Matrices of Doubly Selective Fading Channels for MIMO OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S44P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053094S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917852,"authors":[{"name":"Gyu Bum Kyung","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Gyu Bum","lastName":"Kyung","id":"37546708200"},{"name":"Chih-Chun Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Chih-Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292502400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917852","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Parity check codes","MIMO","Data mining","Gaussian channels","Broadcasting","Iterative decoding","Convolutional codes","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","parity check codes","random codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary dirty paper channel coding","random binning approach","superposition coding","nonuniform-a-priori distribution","symbol mapper","low-density parity-check code","density evolution","extrinsic information transfer analysis"]}],"abstract":"We propose a practical scheme for binary dirty-paper channels. By exploiting the concept of random binning instead of superposition coding, the complexity of the system is greatly reduced. For comparison, the existing approaches require one of the native codes to be of non-uniform a priori distribution, which is generally achieved by combining a symbol mapper and high-order-alphabet low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Using high-order alphabets increases significantly the complexity and the resulting method is not flexible for designing systems of practical channel parameters. In contrast, we propose to implement the random binning concept using only binary LDPC and binary convolutional codes. In this work, some design challenges of this random binning approach are identified and addressed. Our systems are optimized by the joint use of density evolution (DE) and the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) analysis. Simulation results using practical Quasi-Cyclic LDPC codes show that our system achieves similar performance to the state-of-the-art, high-order-alphabet LDPC-based systems while demonstrating significant advantages in terms of complexity and flexibility of system design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Designs and Challenges of Practical Binary Dirty Paper Coding","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917852","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917852.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Designs and Challenges of Practical Binary Dirty Paper Coding","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917852/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646625","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Designs and Challenges of Practical Binary Dirty Paper Coding","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S35P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059236S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917853,"authors":[{"name":"Barbara M.

The proposed LDPC code does not exhibit the error floor phenomena, in the region of interest, even in the presence of imperfect cophasing and receiver unbalances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Impact of Imperfect Cophasing in Uncoded and LDPC-Coded EGC Receivers over Generalized Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917856","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917856.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Impact of Imperfect Cophasing in Uncoded and LDPC-Coded EGC Receivers over Generalized Fading Channels","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917856/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646629","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Impact of Imperfect Cophasing in Uncoded and LDPC-Coded EGC Receivers over Generalized Fading Channels","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S03P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050532S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917858,"authors":[{"name":"Gabor Fodor","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Wireless Access Networks, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Gabor","lastName":"Fodor","id":"37270461500"},{"name":"Anders Furuskar","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Wireless Access Networks, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Furuskar","id":"37275756500"},{"name":"Per Skillermark","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Wireless Access Networks, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Per","lastName":"Skillermark","id":"37403384400"},{"name":"Jinghong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jinghong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37634548800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917858","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":196},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","OFDM","Power control","Scheduling algorithm","Base stations","Wireless networks","Power system modeling","Throughput","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","power control","radio access networks","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink scheduling","intercell interference variation","MIMO OFDM systems","multicell single input single output systems","adaptive precoder selection","multiple input multiple output cellular networks","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","proportional fair scheduler","open loop power control scheme"]}],"abstract":"Recently, several works have pointed out the negative impact of intercell interference variation on the performance of link adaptation in multi-cell single input single output (SISO) systems.

In this paper we develop a simulation model for MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) networks that allows us to study the impact of popular scheduling and power control algorithms on the time variation of the uplink interference power. We find that employing a time persistent proportional fair scheduler (which we term proportional fair in frequency, PFF, scheduler) together with an open loop power control scheme significantly reduces intercell interference variation and thereby it provides higher throughput than traditional schedulers that are primarily optimized for a single cell setting without taking into account the variation of the intercell interference power.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Impact of Uplink Scheduling on Intercell Interference Variation in MIMO OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917858","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917858.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Impact of Uplink Scheduling on Intercell Interference Variation in MIMO OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917858/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646631","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Impact of Uplink Scheduling on Intercell Interference Variation in MIMO OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S15P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052962S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917859,"authors":[{"name":"Dorra Ben Cheikh","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Dorra","lastName":"Ben Cheikh","id":"37391909100"},{"name":"Ahmed Saadani","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Saadani","id":"37268236000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917859","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"abstract":"The overall relay channel from the source to the destination via relays has temporal properties quite different from any cellular channel.

In most previous works on relay-based cellular networks, scheduling at relay stations (RSs) is not allowed. Hence, each RS should immediately transmit all the received data from the base station (BS) in the first phase in a time-slot to mobile stations (MSs) in the second phase in the same time-slot. In this strategy, the effective data rate of the two-hop transmission (BS-RS and RS-MS) is limited to the rate of the link with worse channel state among two links. Hence, in those systems, even though opportunistic scheduling is allowed in the BS, time-varying channel state of each link cannot be fully exploited, which may result in wastes of radio resources. However, if opportunistic scheduling is allowed not only at the BS but also at each RS, the BS and each RS can fully exploit time-varying channel state of each link, so that more efficient radio resource allocation is possible. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that aims at maximizing the average sum-rate of relay-based networks where the time-varying wireless channel is modeled as a stochastic process. By solving the problem, we develop an optimal power scheduling algorithm which can be implemented in a distributed manner at the BS and each RS. Simulation results show that by allowing opportunistic scheduling at both the BS and RSs, we can improve system performance more significantly.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917864","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917864.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Power Scheduling for OFDMA Cellular Networks with Scheduling at Relay Stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917864/","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Power Scheduling for OFDMA Cellular Networks with Scheduling at Relay Stations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646637","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917864/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Power Scheduling for OFDMA Cellular Networks with Scheduling at Relay Stations","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S04P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061155S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917865,"authors":[{"name":"Kyuho Son","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyuho","lastName":"Son","id":"37268350900"},{"name":"Bang Chul Jung","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology Convergence, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bang Chul","lastName":"Jung","id":"37289794700"},{"name":"Song Chong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Chong","id":"37276102200"},{"name":"Dan Keun Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dan Keun","lastName":"Sung","id":"37276225900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917865","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":443},"abstract":"Underlay transmission in cognitive radio enables a secondary (unlicensed) system to utilize a frequency band of primary (licensed) system as long as the unlicensee interferes less than a certain threshold with the licensee. The secondary system needs to carefully consider not only its own channel to achieve a capacity gain by this sharing spectrum in multi- carrier systems, but also the interference channel to reduce interference at the primary receiver. In this paper, we formulate a capacity maximization problem of the secondary system under an interference-power constraint as well as a conventional transmit- power constraint, and propose an optimal power allocation policy in which we exploit a two-dimensional frequency-selectivity on both channels. Through extensive simulations, we compare the performance of optimal power allocation policy with that of equal power allocation policy and further investigate the effect of the primary's power allocation policy on the performance of the secondary system. Numerical results show that the optimal power allocation policy can achieve a higher capacity in more frequency- selective channels, compared to an equal power allocation policy. Interestingly, a water-filling policy for the primary system also gives additional opportunities to the secondary system than the equal power allocation policy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917865.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Underlay Transmission in Multi-Carrier Cognitive Radio Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Interference constraints","FCC","Information technology","Radio spectrum management","Resource management","Licenses","Radio transmitters","Chromium","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic underlay transmission","multi-carrier cognitive radio systems","interference channel","optimal power allocation","frequency-selective channels","water-filling policy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Underlay Transmission in Multi-Carrier Cognitive Radio Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917865/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646638","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Underlay Transmission in Multi-Carrier Cognitive Radio Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S07P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063729S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4917867,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Hoon Kim","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Technology Research Laboratory, LG Institute of Technology, LG Electronics, Inc., Kyunggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Hoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37402021500"},{"name":"Seong-Jun Oh","affiliation":["College of Information & Communication, Division of Computer and Communications Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Jun","lastName":"Oh","id":"37279129300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917867","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Throughput","Mobile communication","Signal to noise ratio","Scheduling algorithm","Encoding","Data communication","Bit error rate","Linearity","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","data communication","packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","uplink packet CDMA transmission","single-cell packet data communications","noise power spectral density"]}],"abstract":"This paper revisits an optimal rate and power allocation problem to maximize throughput in uplink CDMA single-cell packet data communications. First, we show that the widely-accepted belief that an optimally selected rate always keeps a constant value of the resulting bit energy to the interference plus noise power spectral density ratio is not true in most practical CDMA packet transmission environments, where the packet size varies in proportion to the rate. Then, we derive the rate-dependent optimal bit energy-to-interference-noise power spectral density ratio, based on which we convert the original joint optimization problem of rate and power to an equivalent but simple power allocation problem. Finally, we derive an optimal power allocation strategy by applying the convex optimization theory. Through two instructive examples, we show that the optimality of the well-known bang bang power control, that is, each user (except at most one user) should either transmit his data at the maximum allowed power level or at the minimum required power level meeting the SINR requirement in order to maximize the system throughput, may or may not be true depending on the incorporated channel coding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917867","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917867.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Rate and Power Allocation in Uplink Packet CDMA Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Rate and Power Allocation in Uplink Packet CDMA Transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917867/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646640","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917867/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Rate and Power Allocation in Uplink Packet CDMA Transmission","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S25P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050099S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917872,"authors":[{"name":"Anatoliy A.

Intuitively, the more secondary users (SUs) are involved in sensing, the more sensing accuracy the CR can achieve, whereas the more sensing overhead the SUs consume, the less throughput the CR network can achieve. In this paper, we investigate overhead-throughput tradeoff over fading channels in a cooperative CR network that consists of a number of the SUs employing energy detectors and a single decision fusion center. We propose a design strategy to maximize the throughput of the SU network by choosing appropriate sensing length and the number of the SUs reporting to a decision fusion center. Moreover, we extend our analysis to a two-stage cooperative sensing mechanism where the second-stage fine sensing is triggered whenever any SU reports the presence of a PU after the first-stage detection. Our numerical results show that compared with the single stage sensing, the two-stage sensing scheme achieves higher throughput via the reduction of the probability of false alarm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917876.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overhead-Throughput Tradeoff in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917876/","displayDocTitle":"Overhead-Throughput Tradeoff in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646649","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overhead-Throughput Tradeoff in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S30P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07275S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4917880,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Coon","affiliation":["Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Coon","id":"37268288300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917880","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Frequency division multiplexing","Interference","Throughput","Energy management","Power system management","Signal analysis","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error statistics","interference (signal)","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio reduction","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM system","per-subcarrier antenna selection","tone reservation scheme","transmission interference signal","bit-error rate","multiantenna system"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new tone reservation (TR) scheme that facilitates peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems employing antenna selection on a per-subcarrier basis. In contrast to conventional TR schemes, the proposed technique does not lead to a reduction in the data rate, although it does introduce a controllable level of interference into the transmission, which can affect the throughput. We show that this drawback is manageable by analyzing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the bit-error rate at high signal-to-noise ratio, and we conclude that it is best to allocate a large number of tones for PAPR reduction using only a small amount of power per tone. Finally, we illustrate through simulations that the proposed TR scheme is capable of facilitating PAPR reduction in practical systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems with Per-Subcarrier Antenna Selection","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917880","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917880.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems with Per-Subcarrier Antenna Selection","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917880/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646653","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems with Per-Subcarrier Antenna Selection","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S19P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044835S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917881,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojing Huang","affiliation":["CSIRO ICT Centre Sydney, Wireless Technologies Laboratory, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293558100"},{"name":"Y.

The principle of the PPT scheme is to divide a packet into a number of smaller parallel packets, and transmit each smaller packet over an individual subcarrier of the OFDM symbols instead of spreading the data bits in a packet across a number of different subcarriers. It is proved theoretically that the proposed PPT scheme has higher average throughput than the conventional serial packet transmission without preceding.

Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the performance of MC-CDMA depends strongly on the selection of the utilized spreading codes.

We show that the limiting distribution of maximum SNR is of the Gumbel-type and average capacity scaling law follows log log K form. We also consider the effect of scheduling delay on the performance of scheduling scheme. Then, we propose two limited feedback scheduling and obtain their average capacity and show that they match the simulation results very well. In the first approach, the base station (BS) always collects feedback from the user with the best channel condition. We derive the normalized feedback load as well as the threshold value that minimizes it. The second approach employs quantization for each user, so that few bits of SNR are sent to the BS. We show that even with 1-bit quantization, the proposed quantized feedback scheduling can exploit multiuser diversity at the expense of trivial decrease of average capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917887.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multiuser MIMO Scheduling with Full and Limited Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","MIMO","Feedback","Antenna feeds","Quantization","Transmitting antennas","Processor scheduling","Space technology","Wireless communication","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","feedback","MIMO communication","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","multiuser MIMO scheduling","limited feedback scheduling","user scheduling","multiuser diversities","antenna diversities","maximum SNR","Gumbel-type law","average capacity scaling law","quantized feedback scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multiuser MIMO Scheduling with Full and Limited Feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917887/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646660","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Multiuser MIMO Scheduling with Full and Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S15P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046235S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917888,"authors":[{"name":"Yuexing Peng","affiliation":["Key lab of universal wireless communications, Ministry of, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuexing","lastName":"Peng","id":"37405085900"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Key lab of universal wireless communications, Ministry of, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"},{"name":"Young il Kim","affiliation":["Mobile Telecommunication Research division, Wireless System Research Group, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young il","lastName":"Kim","id":"38256032400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917888","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"abstract":"In fast moving environment, the inter-carrier interference (ICI) due to Doppler spread will degrade the performance of OFDM system severely.

To combat intersymbol interference (ISI), single-user chip-level minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) equalizer is used to detect the data users. PIC is applied to suppress the interference from data users to speech users, and RAKE to detect the speech users. As an input to the PIC stage, we may use the hard or soft symbol decisions (HD, SD) from the data users' demodulator or decoder outputs. The latter requires re-encoding of the decoded symbols. This adds to complexity, but increases also the reliability of the interference estimates. Results and analysis are provided for both ideal and MMSE channel estimation (CE). We show that the combination of PIC and RAKE outperforms the simple MMSE equalization in all studied cases. Using re-encoded soft symbol decisions for interference estimate calculation always leads to the best performance. However, in some scenarios the performance loss due to using the soft symbol decisions from the demodulator output is almost negligible.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917893.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917893","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917893","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917893","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Speech","Intersymbol interference","Demodulation","Decoding","Interference cancellation","Equalizers","Interference suppression","High definition video","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance comparison","feasible MMSE-PIC algorithms","channel estimation","HSUPA","high speed uplink packet access","speech user performance","parallel interference cancellation","intersymbol interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917893/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of Feasible MMSE-PIC Algorithms with Channel Estimation for HSUPA","accessionNumber":"10646666","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917893/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of Feasible MMSE-PIC Algorithms with Channel Estimation for HSUPA","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S22P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056778S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917898,"authors":[{"name":"Shuping Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications,  Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37308973600"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications,  Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"},{"name":"Xing Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications,  Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279334700"},{"name":"Dong Zhao","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications,  Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37402821000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917898","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":630},"abstract":"Performance analysis is presented for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay channels with transmit antenna selection and maximal-ratio combining receive (TAS/MRC) in two-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relay networks operating over flat Rayleigh fading channels, where the source and destination are equipped with Ns and Nj antennas, respectively, and communicate with each other with the help of a single-antenna relay.

In order to achieve better signal detection performance in low SNR regions where the cyclostationary features are overwhelmed by strong noise, we resort to multiple antenna technique. We then propose three signal detection methods for multiple antenna scheme, namely maximum ratio combination method, multiple decision result fusion method and comparison detection method, which are motivated by MIMO techniques and structure characteristic of spectral correlation function estimation.

All users are assigned the same set of Hadamard sequences, thus our proposed technique reduces the overall number of spreading sequences required by the system. In the example shown in the paper, the proposed spreading combination allows both an increase in spectral efficiency and a four-fold decrease in the number of spreading codes needed by the system. Moreover, permutation spreading shows more than 7 dB advantage over conventional MIMO-CDMA system in a heavily loaded environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917905.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Permutation Spreading for Asynchronous MIMO-CDMA Systems Using Hadamard Codes and Gold Scrambling Sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Error correction codes","Gold","MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Transmitting antennas","Data engineering","Diversity reception","Multiple access interference","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Hadamard codes","MIMO communication","sequential codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permutation spreading code","asynchronous MIMO-CDMA system","Hadamard code","gold scrambling sequence code","transmit antenna separation","multiple input multiple output-code division multiple access","frequency selective channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Permutation Spreading for Asynchronous MIMO-CDMA Systems Using Hadamard Codes and Gold Scrambling Sequences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917905/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646678","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Permutation Spreading for Asynchronous MIMO-CDMA Systems Using Hadamard Codes and Gold Scrambling Sequences","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S07P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041495S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917907,"authors":[{"name":"Hlaing Minn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Hlaing","lastName":"Minn","id":"37269620000"},{"name":"Daniel Munoz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Munoz","id":"37411289300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917907","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Signal processing","Interference","Transmitters","Temperature","Relays","Performance analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot designs","channel estimation","OFDM systems","frequency-dependent I/Q imbalances","semiconductor downscaling","enhanced signal processing","device impairments","intercarrier interferences","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"The advances in semiconductor downscaling have empowered communication devices with significantly enhanced signal processing capability, but with the side effect of larger device impairments. Among those impairments, the I/Q imbalance is a critical one as it causes intercarrier interferences in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The I/Q imbalances in general exist at both transmitter and receiver, and they can be frequency-dependent. They may vary over time (e.g. due to sudden changes in temperature or the dynamics of the cooperating/relaying users). Under such scenarios, estimation and compensation of the combined effect of the channel and I/Q imbalances are crucial. This paper presents efficient pilot designs for such tasks. The advantages of the proposed designs over the existing ones in terms of estimation performance and overhead efficiency are corroborated by analysis and simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917907","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917907.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Designs for Channel Estimation of OFDM Systems with Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Designs for Channel Estimation of OFDM Systems with Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalances","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917907/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646680","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917907/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Designs for Channel Estimation of OFDM Systems with Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalances","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S31P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050103S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4917908,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Gao","id":"37533788400"},{"name":"Wei Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37532870200"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279763400"},{"name":"Wenqing Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenqing","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37280063900"},{"name":"Shu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280444700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917908","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":274},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917908","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Sequential analysis","Time measurement","Communications Society","Pipelines","Interference","Hardware","Fading","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio networks","fusion center","multi-threaded sequential probability ratio test method","data fusion technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917908","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917908.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"Cooperation can improve the performance of spectrum sensing. However, the sensing overhead is generally increasing with the number of cooperating users as more data needs to be reported to the fusion center. Most existing works assume a general time frame structure in which spectrum observing and sensing results reporting are conducted sequentially. We argue that this frame structure is inefficient, since the time consumed by reporting contributes little to the performance of spectrum sensing. In this paper, we propose a pipelined spectrum sensing framework, in which spectrum observing is conducted concurrently with results reporting in a pipelined way. By making use of the reporting time for sensing, the new framework provides a much wider observing window for spectrum measurement, which results in a performance improvement of spectrum sensing. Besides, we also present a multi-threaded sequential probability ratio test method (MTSPRT) which is very suitable for the pipelined framework as the data fusion technique. The MTSPRT method can improve the sensing speed significantly. Numerical results indicate that our pipelined sensing scheme incorporating with MTSPRT shows a better performance than the cooperative sensing based on the general frame structure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917908/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10646681","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917908/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S23P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040826S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4917909,"authors":[{"name":"Fadi A.

This process is usually done using a pseudo noise (PN) code acquisition algorithm to search for the correct propagation delay within a window of possible delays. In this paper, we propose a new approach to solving the PN code acquisition problem using advanced Boolean satisfiability (SAT) techniques. SAT solvers use intelligent search algorithms that can traverse the search space and efficiently prune parts that contain no solutions. These solvers have recently been used to solve many challenging problems in Engineering and Computer Science. In this paper, we show how to formulate the PN code acquisition problem as a SAT instance and evaluate the use of advanced SAT techniques in solving the problem. Our approach is verified by simulation and presented results indicate that the proposed system achieves a detection probability for the correct delay of almost 100% for all practical cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917909/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917909/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646682","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"PN Code Acquisition Using Boolean Satisfiability Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PN Code Acquisition Using Boolean Satisfiability Techniques","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S25P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059968S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917911,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Davies","affiliation":["Advanced Signal Processing Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Loughborough University, UK"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Davies","id":"37628302000"},{"name":"Sangarapillai Lambotharan","affiliation":["Advanced Signal Processing Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Loughborough University, UK"],"firstName":"Sangarapillai","lastName":"Lambotharan","id":"37273617900"},{"name":"Joanne Foster","affiliation":["Advanced Signal Processing Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Loughborough University, UK"],"firstName":"Joanne","lastName":"Foster","id":"37286906100"},{"name":"Jonathon Chambers","affiliation":["Advanced Signal Processing Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Loughborough University, UK"],"firstName":"Jonathon","lastName":"Chambers","id":"37273618700"},{"name":"John McWhirter","affiliation":["Center of D.S.P., School of Engineering, Cardiff University, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"McWhirter","id":"37298007800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917911","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Matrix decomposition","Iterative decoding","Frequency","MIMO","OFDM","Decision feedback equalizers","Transmitters","Delay","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decision feedback equalisers","iterative decoding","matrix decomposition","MIMO communication","polynomial matrices","time division multiple access","turbo codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial matrix QR decomposition","iterative decoding","frequency selective MIMO channel","frequency flat multi input multi output system","MIMO channel equalization problem","decision feedback","transmitter design","H-BLAST","V-BLAST","horizontal-vertical bell laboratories layered space time encoding","turbo equalization","multipath delay spread","multistream data feedback","TDMA system"]}],"abstract":"For a frequency flat multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system the QR decomposition can be applied to reduce the MIMO channel equalization problem to a set of decision feedback based single channel problems.

In general conditions, cognitive secondary users are mobile nodes powered by battery and consuming power is one of the most important problem that facing cognitive networks; therefore, the power consumption is considered as a main constraint. In this paper, we study the performance of cognitive radio networks considering the sensing parameters as well as power constraint. The power constraint is integrated into the objective function named power efficiency which is a combination of the main system parameters of the cognitive network. We prove the existence of optimal combination of parameters such that the power efficiency is maximized. Then we reformulate the objective function to incorporate the throughput. According to different constraints or degree of significance, we may put proper weight to each term so that we could obtain more preferable combination of parameters. Computer simulations have given the optimal solution curve for different weights. We can draw the conclusion that if we put more emphasis on power efficiency, the transmit power is a more critical parameter, however if throughput is more important, the effect of sensing time is significant.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917912","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917912.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917912","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Efficiency Maximization in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Power Efficiency Maximization in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917912/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917912/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646685","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Efficiency Maximization in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S28P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052129S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917913,"authors":[{"name":"Umesh Phuyal","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Umesh","lastName":"Phuyal","id":"37640825500"},{"name":"Anjana Punchihewa","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Anjana","lastName":"Punchihewa","id":"37635987900"},{"name":"Vijay K.

The efficiency, however, depends heavily on their transceiver design. In particular, being able to use non-contiguously aligned spectrum bands simultaneously is a critical requirement. Prior work in this area requires a control channel so that transmitter/receiver pairs can synchronize on their spectrum usage patterns. However, this approach can suffer from high cost and control congestion. In this paper, we propose an in-band solution for informing receivers the spectrum usage patterns. By judiciously designing packet preambles, we embed the spectrum usage patterns in each data packet. Using the legacy 802.11 preamble structure, we focus on choosing the appropriate preamble sequences to maintain reliable packet detection in the presence of noise and interference. We verify our design using simulation and show that it can lead to reliable packet transmissions comparable to those of contiguous spectrum usage. We also identify the impact of interference on our design and propose refinements to choose the preamble sequence using information on the interference.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917916","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917916.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preamble Design for Non-Contiguous Spectrum Usage in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Preamble Design for Non-Contiguous Spectrum Usage in Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917916/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646689","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917916/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preamble Design for Non-Contiguous Spectrum Usage in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S28P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120257S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917920,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407465000"},{"name":"Alexander Wong","affiliation":["Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Wong","id":"37286976100"},{"name":"Pin-Han Ho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Pin-Han","lastName":"Ho","id":"37276781000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917920","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Chromium","Statistics","Design engineering","Systems engineering and theory","Availability","Bandwidth","Peer to peer computing","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","frequency allocation","statistical analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","spatiotemporal statistical fusion","prioritized spectrum sensing","MAC","media access control layer","channel availability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prioritized Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Based on Spatiotemporal Statistical Fusion","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917920.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917920","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917920","abstract":"In this paper, a novel statistics-driven spectrum sensing algorithm is developed for improving spectrum sensing efficiency in the media access control (MAC) layer of cognitive radio (CR) systems. The proposed algorithm aims to achieve higher spectrum sensing efficiency and spectrum access opportunity by prioritizing channels for fine sensing based on the statistical likelihood of channel availability. The sensing priority is obtained by jointly exploiting the long-term spatiotemporal statistics recorded from the historical result of fine sensing, the short-term statistical information of channel condition obtained from a small-scale observation window, and the instantaneous statistical information obtained from fast sensing. Simulation results show that the proposed prioritization algorithm can achieve improved data transmission rates and reduced missed spectrum access opportunities when compared to the conventional non- prioritization spectrum sensing approach for situations where cooperative spectrum sensing is not suitable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10646693","htmlLink":"/document/4917920/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Prioritized Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Based on Spatiotemporal Statistical Fusion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prioritized Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Based on Spatiotemporal Statistical Fusion","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S08P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056835S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917927,"authors":[{"name":"Long Bao Le","firstName":"Long Bao","lastName":"Le","id":"37963357200"},{"name":"Patrick Mitran","firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Mitran","id":"37282728500"},{"name":"Catherine Rosenberg","firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Rosenberg","id":"37267959200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917927","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Cognitive radio","Resource management","Base stations","Traffic control","Standards development","OFDM","Communications Society","Interference constraints","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","integer programming","iterative methods","minimax techniques","OFDM modulation","queueing theory","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","downlink OFDM system","downlink resource allocation","queue-aware subchannel","power allocation","finite queue backlog","max-min fairness","iterative procedure","integer program solver"]}],"abstract":"We investigate downlink resource allocation for OFDM-based cognitive radio networks. It is assumed that secondary users are allowed to transmit on all subchannels as long as the interference they create for primary users remains below a critical threshold. We consider a practical setting where secondary users have finite queue backlogs and a total power constraint at the base station and we perform resource allocation either over one or multiple time slots. Specifically, secondary users with small queue backlogs are only allocated sufficient rates to support their traffic demands and the remaining radio resources are shared among highly backlogged users. Under this setting, we formulate the joint subchannel and power problem with max-min fairness for highly backlogged users. Then, we propose an iterative procedure to find an optimal resource allocation solution using an integer program solver. For online implementation, we develop several heuristics of increasing complexity and performance. Numerical results show that the proposed heuristics achieve very good performance compared to the optimal solutions and that taking queue backlogs into account does not make the heuristics much slower while making the system more responsive to users' need.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Queue-Aware Subchannel and Power Allocation for Downlink OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917927","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917927.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Queue-Aware Subchannel and Power Allocation for Downlink OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917927/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646700","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queue-Aware Subchannel and Power Allocation for Downlink OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S15P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060672S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917930,"authors":[{"name":"Luc Vandendorpe","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Vandendorpe","id":"37269898400"},{"name":"Jerome Louveaux","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Louveaux","id":"37296869400"},{"name":"Onur Oguz","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Oguz","id":"37627753300"},{"name":"Abdellatif Zaidi","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Abdellatif","lastName":"Zaidi","id":"37408087100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917930","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"abstract":"We consider an OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) point to point transmission scheme improved by means of multiple relays.

For each relayed carrier the destination implements maximum ratio combining. Assuming perfect CSI (channel state information) knowledge the paper investigates the power allocation problem in order to maximize the rate offered by the scheme. Similarly to the protocol proposed in, the source is allowed to transmit a new symbol during the second time slot when none of the relay is assisting. The constraints of decodability at the relays are properly handled. The optimization is conducted for a constraint on the sum of powers at the source and at the relays. Next to the optimized solution, a suboptimum method based on relay selection is proposed and discussed. The theoretical analysis is illustrated by numerical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917930.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-Optimized Power Allocation for OFDM Transmission with Multiple DF/Regenerative Relays and an Improved Protocol","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Relays","Protocols","Decoding","Power system relaying","Forward contracts","Constraint optimization","Communications Society","Remote sensing","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel coding","decoding","OFDM modulation","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-optimized power allocation","OFDM transmission","regenerative relays","protocol","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","point-to-point transmission scheme","multiple decode-and-forward scheme","channel state information","decodability constraints","suboptimum method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Rate-Optimized Power Allocation for OFDM Transmission with Multiple DF/Regenerative Relays and an Improved Protocol","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917930/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646703","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-Optimized Power Allocation for OFDM Transmission with Multiple DF/Regenerative Relays and an Improved Protocol","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S39P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063598S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917933,"authors":[{"name":"Gao Yang Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Gao Yang","lastName":"Dai","id":"38255870000"},{"name":"Wai Ho Mow","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wai Ho","lastName":"Mow","id":"37271223800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917933","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"abstract":"To improve the efficiency and simplify the complexity of the relay in cooperative communication systems, an one-bit soft forwarding (SF) scheme is proposed to exploit the erroneously decoded packets that are normally abandoned by the selection decode-and-forward (DF) scheme at the relay, as side information to assist decoding of the direct-link packet at the base station. As this side information from relay is encoded and transmitted in the same format as the usual data packet, the proposed SF scheme can be implemented with the same coding scheme and same encoder/decoder as the DF scheme. It only requires the additional transmission of a packet reliability value from the relay to the basestation, unlike the previous soft relaying schemes which require more complicated soft output decoding and signaling format. The new scheme not only allows low complexity implementation, but also offers considerable error performance gain. Simulation results demonstrate that our SF scheme outperforms the selection DF by up to 2 dB, especially when the inter-link channel is poor.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Relays","Decoding","Protective relaying","Mobile communication","Protocols","Protection","Cyclic redundancy check","Communications Society","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","codecs","decoding","radiocommunication","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless cooperative communication","one-bit soft forwarding technique","erroneously decoded packet","direct-link packet","encoder-decoder","packet reliability","error performance gain","relay channel"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917933","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917933.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realizing Wireless Cooperative Communications with the One-Bit Soft Forwarding Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Realizing Wireless Cooperative Communications with the One-Bit Soft Forwarding Technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917933/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917933/","accessionNumber":"10646706","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realizing Wireless Cooperative Communications with the One-Bit Soft Forwarding Technique","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S11P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035084S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4917935,"authors":[{"name":"Joko Radic","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Split, Croatia"],"firstName":"Joko","lastName":"Radic","id":"37299011000"},{"name":"Nikola Rozic","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Split, Croatia"],"firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"Rozic","id":"37299013100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917935","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917935","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Working environment noise","Noise level","OFDM","Gaussian noise","Frequency division multiplexing","Mean square error methods","Analytical models","Iterative methods","Frequency estimation","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulse noise","least mean squares methods","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sample corruption","signal reconstruction","impulse noise","multicarrier system","Bussgang theorem","minimizing mean square error"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses estimation of the signal samples corrupted with impulse noise in multicarrier systems.

The simulation results show that the performance loss of the proposed receiver is only ldB for fast varying channels and less than 0.5 dB for slow varying channels at the bit error rate of 10 4 after 3 iterations, compared with the optimal receiver with perfect channel state information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive Channel Estimation Algorithms for Iterative Receiver in MIMO-OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917936","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917936.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Channel Estimation Algorithms for Iterative Receiver in MIMO-OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917936/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646709","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Channel Estimation Algorithms for Iterative Receiver in MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S31P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113569S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4917937,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Cheng Pao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Cheng","lastName":"Pao","id":"37540506000"},{"name":"Hsien-Cheng Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsien-Cheng","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37632905700"},{"name":"Dah-Chung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Dah-Chung","lastName":"Chang","id":"37290177600"},{"name":"Yung-Fang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281032000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917937","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","OFDM","Channel estimation","Recursive estimation","Noise reduction","Least squares methods","Performance analysis","Least squares approximation","Multipath channels","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","recursive estimation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive parameter estimation","regression channel model","pilot-aided OFDM systems","channel estimation techniques","least squares method","regression model"]}],"abstract":"OFDM model-based channel estimation techniques conventionally apply the least squares method to estimate parameters in a regression model through uniformly distributed pilots in a local region. However, the model estimation must use as many pilots as possible to reduce the effect of noises with the penalty of increasing the storage size for received OFDM symbols. We observed that the model parameters between neighboring local regions are correlated. Hence, some recursive methods are proposed to adaptively estimate model parameters such that the required number of pilots can be reduced, and thus, the required storage size is reduced for interpolating the symbols used in the regression model. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that a better performance is obtained as well by using the proposed parameter estimation methods.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917937","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917937.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive Parameter Estimation for Regression Channel Model in Pilot-Aided OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917937/","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Parameter Estimation for Regression Channel Model in Pilot-Aided OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646710","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917937/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Parameter Estimation for Regression Channel Model in Pilot-Aided OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S38P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054247S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917939,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Arulselvan","affiliation":["Network Advanced Technologies, Motorola, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Arulselvan","id":"37424746600"},{"name":"Suresh Kalyanasundaram","affiliation":["Network Advanced Technologies, Motorola, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Suresh","lastName":"Kalyanasundaram","id":"37371077800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917939","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Fading","Frequency diversity","Resource management","Wideband","Frequency selective surfaces","Communications Society","Physical layer","Frequency conversion","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","feedback","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced feedback","signaling schemes","sum-rate maximization","OFDMA systems","feedback overhead","signaling overhead","physical resource block","channel quality indication","multiuser diversity","fine-granular channel quality information"]}],"abstract":"We study several channel quality reporting strategies for OFDMA systems that maximize the sum-rate while constrained by feedback and signaling overhead. These reporting schemes are based on the grouping idea, which essentially limits the number of users accessing a sub-channel or physical resource block. This in turn reduces the overhead needed to convey channel quality indication (CQI). On the other hand, grouping user and/or sub-channels reduces the multi-user diversity. We investigate this trade-off for various grouping schemes. Numerical experiments show that even for reasonably high overheads, the grouping schemes achieve a substantial gain in sum-rate as compared to reporting on all sub-channels. Reporting fine- granular channel quality information on the user's best subchannels, is found to be the optimal strategy.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917939","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917939.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Feedback and Signaling Schemes for Sum-Rate Maximization in OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917939/","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Feedback and Signaling Schemes for Sum-Rate Maximization in OFDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646712","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917939/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Feedback and Signaling Schemes for Sum-Rate Maximization in OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S15P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045864S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4917941,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Krikidis","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Communications, Joint Research Institute of Signal and Image Processing School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Krikidis","id":"37275149300"},{"name":"John Thompson","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Communications, Joint Research Institute of Signal and Image Processing School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Thompson","id":"37273630300"},{"name":"Steve McLaughlin","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Communications, Joint Research Institute of Signal and Image Processing School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"McLaughlin","id":"38184618700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917941","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"abstract":"In this paper, an amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative strategy in interference limited networks is considered. In contrast to previously reported work, where the effect of interference is ignored, the effect of multi-user interference in AF schemes is analyzed. It is shown that the interference changes the statistical description of the conventional AF protocol and a statistical expression is subsequently derived. Asymptotic analysis of the expression shows that interference limits the diversity gain of the system and the related channel capacity is bounded by a stationary point. In addition, it is proven that previously proposed relay selection criteria for multi-relay scenarios become inefficient in the presence of interference. Based on a consideration of the interference term, two new selection criteria suitable for different system set-ups are proposed. A theoretical framework for selecting when to apply the proposed selection criteria is also presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cooperative systems","Interference","Protocols","Communications Society","Digital relays","Digital communication","Signal processing","Image processing","Electronic mail","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","protocols","radiofrequency interference","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay selection","amplify-and-forward cooperative systems","multi-user interference","statistical description","statistical expression","asymptotic analysis","channel capacity","ad hoc networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917941","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917941.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Selection Issues for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Systems with Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Relay Selection Issues for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Systems with Interference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917941/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917941/","accessionNumber":"10646714","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Selection Issues for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Systems with Interference","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S14P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056032S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917945,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Li","id":"37533889700"},{"name":"Hamid Jafarkhani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Jafarkhani","id":"37274579200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917945","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","MIMO","Fading","Peer to peer computing","Throughput","Spread spectrum communication","Covariance matrix","Channel capacity","Nonlinear equations","Mobile ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","channel capacity","computational complexity","covariance matrices","fading channels","MIMO communication","optimisation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation algorithm","MIMO multihop fading channel capacity","wireless ad hoc network","optimization problem","throughput maximization","low complexity algorithm","optimal transmit covariance matrix","optimal power allocation"]}],"abstract":"MIMO multi-hop channel plays an important role in wireless ad hoc networks.

In this paper, we consider resource allocation of OFDMA in time division duplex (TDD) mode in which the new transmission frame with multiple time slots is popped up on every pre-specified period. Frame resource is divided into chunks that are composed of a group of subcarriers with equal and constant time duration. Our centralized resource allocation scheme aims to provide the guaranteed service to users by converting the required service into the network cost. The users whose network costs are too high are not guaranteed in order not to waste the precious bandwidth. We formulate the optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the total cost. Furthermore, a heuristic method is proposed to schedule users' data into the downlink subframe by exploiting multiuser multichannel diversity to guarantee the service and to utilize system's bandwidth wisely. Intensive simulation shows that our scheme provides satisfied throughput, low packet drop rate, and low queuing delay. Moreover, the results also show that the scheme is fair to users in both throughput and service time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917946.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Guaranteed Service in OFDMA Based Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Bandwidth","Wireless networks","Costs","Traffic control","Downlink","Throughput","Informatics","WiMAX","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDMA","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","wireless network","time division duplex","optimization problem","heuristic method","multiuser multichannel diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Guaranteed Service in OFDMA Based Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917946/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646719","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Guaranteed Service in OFDMA Based Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S16P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085147S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917947,"authors":[{"name":"Liping Wang","affiliation":["Graduate University of Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Liping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293103400"},{"name":"Yusheng Ji","affiliation":["Graduate University of Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Tokyo, Japan","National Institute of Information, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusheng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37287372900"},{"name":"Fuqiang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fuqiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289975000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917947","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Relays","Throughput","Linear programming","Filling","Decoding","Downlink","Power system relaying","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA relay-enhanced system","cooperative selection diversity scheme","decode-and-forward relaying","binary integer programming problem","constant power allocation","linear programming","heuristic resource allocation algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The cooperative selection diversity (CSD) scheme which dynamically selects the best transmission scheme between decode-and-forward relaying and direct transmission outperforms the other complex cooperative diversity schemes in terms of throughput and implementation complexity.

Taking the maximization of the weighted sum rate of such groups as the design objective, we propose a practically optimal subcarrier and power allocation scheme under constraints on the tolerable interference thresholds at individual primary user's frequency bands. Specifically, the optimization problem is solved via the dual method, where subcarriers are assigned in a per-tone basis and power is distributed in a water-filling fashion. As the number of subcarriers becomes large, the dual-domain solution becomes the global optimum of the primal problem with the duality gap vanishing to zero. The proposed design is valid for both unicast and multicast transmissions, and its computational complexity is only linear in the number of subcarriers. The effects of adjacent subcarrier nulling technique, which is to reduce mutual interference between primary and secondary frequency bands, on the proposed scheme are also examined. The superiority of the dual approach is confirmed by numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917948","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917948.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Multicast Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917948/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Multicast Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646721","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917948/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Multicast Networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S16P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054001S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917950,"authors":[{"name":"Naveed UL Hassan","affiliation":["Plateau du Moulon, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d Electricit\u00e9, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Naveed","lastName":"UL Hassan","id":"37530376200"},{"name":"Mohamad Assaad","affiliation":["Plateau du Moulon, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d Electricit\u00e9, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Assaad","id":"37269223500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917950","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Frequency conversion","Downlink","Throughput","Base stations","Interference","Communications Society","Bandwidth","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","multiuser OFDMA system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system","sum-rate maximization problem","power allocation decisions","transmit power constraint","data rate constraints"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies resource allocation problem in downlink multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system.

Amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying is adopted for its simplicity. Taking the independent channel transfer function of different subcarriers and links into consideration, we formulate a resource allocation optimization problem for joint subcarrier assignment, subcarrier matching and power allocation of the two-hop transmission. A heuristic suboptimal algorithm which decomposes the joint problem is proposed. First, equal power allocation is assumed in a partial- update manner to help assigning subcarriers to each relay for matching; then optimal power allocation is achieved by joint waterfilling of source and relays under separate power constraints to further increase system capacity. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm has a near-optimal performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917951.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation Optimization for OFDM-Based Amplify-And-Forward Multi-Relay System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Power system relaying","Relays","Wireless communication","OFDM","Signal processing","Transfer functions","Signal processing algorithms","Decoding","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation","transfer functions","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation optimization","OFDM-based amplify-and-forward multirelay system","capacity maximization","independent channel transfer function","subcarrier matching","power allocation","two-hop transmission","wireless communication system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation Optimization for OFDM-Based Amplify-And-Forward Multi-Relay System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917951/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646724","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation Optimization for OFDM-Based Amplify-And-Forward Multi-Relay System","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T02S15P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064665S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917952,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihua Tang","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Tang","id":"37401770900"},{"name":"Guo Wei","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281335000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917952","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Relays","Power system relaying","OFDM","Downlink","Streaming media","Frequency conversion","Capacity planning","Intersymbol interference","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","gradient methods","OFDM modulation","optimisation","relaxation theory","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","broadband cellular OFDMA","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system","relay network","decode-and-forward mode","relay selection optimization problem","subcarrier assignment","power allocation","downlink capacity maximization problem","continuous relaxation problem","subgradient method","integer-valued solution","fairness consideration"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a broadband cellular orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system with relay nodes operating in decode-and-forward (DF) mode.

Both the base station (BS) as well as the users are equipped with multiple antennas. The BS employs Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) for inter-user interference pre-cancellation at the transmitter. First, we consider the case where the CSIT error is Gaussian-distributed. In this case, the robust transceiver design seeks to minimize a stochastic function of the sum mean square error (SMSE) under a constraint on the total BS transmit power. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve this problem. Each iteration involves the solution of a second order cone program (SOCP). Next, we consider the case where the CSIT error can be specified by an uncertainty set. In this case, we consider a minimax design for the robust transceiver, where the worst-case SMSE is minimized under a constraint on the total BS transmit power. We show that this design problem can be solved by an iterative algorithm, wherein each iteration involves a pair of semi-definite programs (SDP). Further, we consider an extension of the proposed algorithm to the case with per-antenna power constraints. We illustrate the robustness of the proposed algorithms to imperfections in CSIT through simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust THP Transceiver Designs for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917954","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917954.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust THP Transceiver Designs for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917954/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646727","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust THP Transceiver Designs for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S15P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081165S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917965,"authors":[{"name":"Hyeonmok Ko","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeonmok","lastName":"Ko","id":"37630773000"},{"name":"Seungyoul Oh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungyoul","lastName":"Oh","id":"37633492400"},{"name":"Bongsu Kim","affiliation":["Corporate Research & Development Division, Hyundai Motor Company R and D Center, Hwaseong, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bongsu","lastName":"Kim","id":"38183293300"},{"name":"Cheeha Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Cheeha","lastName":"Kim","id":"37350578800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917965","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Bit error rate","OFDM","Broadband communication","Multimedia communication","Radio spectrum management","Fading","Channel state information","State feedback","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","error statistics","fading channels","multimedia communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive bit allocation algorithm","BER constraint","OFDM-based system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","broadband multimedia communication","frequency-selective fading channel environment","channel state information","feedback channel","bit error rate","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been thoroughly investigated as an enabling technology for future broadband multimedia communication. In this paper, we suggest adaptive bit allocation algorithms that operate in a frequency selective fading channel environment by exploiting channel state information obtained through a feedback channel. The proposed algorithms try to maximize the overall throughput of the system with significantly reduced complexity while guaranteeing that mean bit error rate (BER) of all sub-channels remains below the pre-defined BER threshold. To do that, the first proposed algorithm divides all sub-channels into several groups according to their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The grouping criteria are adaptive to the current channel state and BER constraint. The second algorithm tries to find the appropriate constellation size for each sub-channel. The proposed algorithms were compared with existing algorithms through simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are close to optimum solution with significantly lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917965","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917965.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple Bit Allocation Algorithms with BER-Constraint for OFDM-Based Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917965/","displayDocTitle":"Simple Bit Allocation Algorithms with BER-Constraint for OFDM-Based Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646738","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917965/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Bit Allocation Algorithms with BER-Constraint for OFDM-Based Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S42P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059161S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4917968,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Xiong","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37411516000"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291970600"},{"name":"He Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Wang","id":"37634462300"},{"name":"Kai Wu","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Wu","id":"37404407700"},{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chen","id":"37538818900"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37281508500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917968","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Transmitting antennas","Detection algorithms","Euclidean distance","Numerical analysis","Receiving antennas","Concurrent computing","Peer to peer computing","Communications Society","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","interference suppression","maximum likelihood detection","numerical analysis","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-optimal V-BLAST detection","simplified generalized parallel interference cancellation algorithm","maximum-likelihood detection","vertical Bell laboratories","layered space-time architecture","computational complexity","final minimum Euclidean distance decision","numerical analysis","parallel processing elements"]}],"abstract":"Maximum-likelihood detection (MLD) can achieve optimum performance for the vertical Bell laboratories layered space-time (V-BLAST) architecture. However, due to its exponentially high computational complexity, several near-optimal detection algorithms, including some parallel detection (PD) ones with low complexity and high stability, have been proposed instead for practical systems. Nevertheless, the existing PD algorithms have a common drawback in equally handling all the branches obtained via exhaustive interference cancellation (EIC) till reaching the final minimum Euclidean distance (MED) decision. In this paper, a simplified PD algorithm, i.e., a generalized parallel interference cancellation (GPIC) algorithm has been developed by means of early termination of the inferior parallel branches. The algorithm is abbreviated as simplified GPIC (SGPIC) algorithm. Numerical analysis indicates that SGPIC algorithm can achieve the near-optimal performance with much lower complexity in comparison with the existing PD algorithms, especially for the cases of high order constellations. Thus, the SGPIC algorithm makes the parallel detection more feasible in practical systems with limited parallel processing elements.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917968.pdf","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Generalized Parallel Interference Cancellation Algorithm for Near-Optimal V-BLAST Detection","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917968","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Generalized Parallel Interference Cancellation Algorithm for Near-Optimal V-BLAST Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917968/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10646741","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4917968/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Generalized Parallel Interference Cancellation Algorithm for Near-Optimal V-BLAST Detection","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S05P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061982S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4917969,"authors":[{"name":"Antti Tolli","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Tolli","id":"37284723300"},{"name":"Harri Pennanen","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Harri","lastName":"Pennanen","id":"37393361400"},{"name":"Petri Komulainen","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"Komulainen","id":"37393360200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917969","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":707},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Array signal processing","Transceivers","Interference constraints","Base stations","Design methodology","Processor scheduling","Dynamic scheduling","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","antenna arrays","array signal processing","MIMO communication","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated multicell processing","distributed base station antenna","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output channel","MIMO channel","linear transceivers","antenna power constraints","system optimisation objective","data streams","coherent multicell beamforming","single-cell beamforming","intercell interference coordination","heuristic beam allocation algorithms","dynamic beam allocation","partial spatial loading","signal to noise ratio balancing"]}],"abstract":"Coordinated multi-cell processing facilitates multiuser preceding techniques across distributed base station (BS) antenna heads. Hence, it can efficiently exploit the available spatial degrees of freedom in a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. A generalised method for joint design of linear transceivers with coordinated multi-cell processing subject to per-BS/antenna power constraints is proposed. The system optimisation objective is to balance the weighted SINR across all the transmitted data streams. The method can accommodate a variety of scenarios from coherent multi-cell beamforming across a large virtual MIMO channel to single-cell beamforming with inter- cell interference coordination and beam allocation. The performance of different coherent/non-coherent and coordinated/non-coordinated multi-cell transmission methods with optimal and heuristic beam allocation algorithms is numerically compared in different scenarios with varying inter-cell interference. The coherent multi-cell beamforming greatly outperforms the noncoherent cases, especially at the cell edge and with a full spatial load. However, the coordinated single-cell transmission with interference avoidance and dynamic beam allocation performs considerably well with a partial spatial loading.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SINR Balancing with Coordinated Multi-Cell Transmission","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917969","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917969.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"SINR Balancing with Coordinated Multi-Cell Transmission","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917969/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646742","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SINR Balancing with Coordinated Multi-Cell Transmission","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S15P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073877S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4917971,"authors":[{"name":"Pan Qun","affiliation":["Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Qun","id":"37088442228"},{"name":"Yongyu Chang","affiliation":["Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing"],"firstName":"Yongyu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292169600"},{"name":"Ruiming Zheng","affiliation":["Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing"],"firstName":"Ruiming","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37529064500"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291970600"},{"name":"Yafeng Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing"],"firstName":"Yafeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087758910"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","affiliation":["Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing"],"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37281508500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917971","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Digital TV","Spread spectrum communication","Interference","Bibliographies","FCC","Signal detection","Matched filters","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decoding","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","cooperative sensing","reliable information exchange","spread spectrum technology","radio interference","decoding scheme"]}],"abstract":"Recently, cooperative sensing which can enhance the sensing performance becomes popular in the design of cognitive radio (CR) networks.

Our main contribution is that we suggest and prove the existence of minimum bit error rate (BER) as a function of pilot signal power, find the best power allocation ratio value that can reach the minimum BER, analyze parameters' influence on the ratio value, and extend our result to multi-hop systems.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917977.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super-Imposed Pilot-Aided Channel Estimation and Power Allocation for Relay Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Power system relaying","Relays","System performance","Bit error rate","Frequency synchronization","Hydrogen","Performance analysis","OFDM","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","power allocation","relay systems","superimposed pilots","improve bandwidth efficiency","amplify and forward relay systems","power allocation method","multihop relay system","minimum bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Super-Imposed Pilot-Aided Channel Estimation and Power Allocation for Relay Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917977/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917977/","accessionNumber":"10646750","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-Imposed Pilot-Aided Channel Estimation and Power Allocation for Relay Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S40P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056283S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4917989,"authors":[{"name":"Piming Ma","affiliation":["UWB Communication Research Center, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Piming","lastName":"Ma","id":"37425433400"},{"name":"Kyungsup Kwak","affiliation":["UWB Communication Research Center, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungsup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917989","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"abstract":"A novel Gaussian approximation algorithm is proposed for calculating the thresholds of low-density parity- check (LDPC) code ensembles under sum-product decoding.

Our goal is to maximize the total throughput under the constraint of total transmission power, while guaranteeing fairness on subchannel occupation by multiple destination nodes (users). Since the optimal solution to this optimization problem is extremely computationally complex to obtain, we decompose the original optimization problem into two subproblems. Firstly, we assign subchannels to the users with the best equivalent channel gains for them under the assumption of equal power distribution among all subchannels. Secondly, water-filling method is adopted to distribute the power to the determined links. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm approaches asymptotically to that of the optimal one, while reducing computational complexity from exponential to linear with the numbers of subchannels, relay nodes and users. It is also shown that subchannel permutation (SP) scheme brings additional throughput gain to DF cooperative transmission.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917991","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917991.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Maximization for OFDMA Cooperative Relaying Networks with Fair Subchannel Allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4917991/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Maximization for OFDMA Cooperative Relaying Networks with Fair Subchannel Allocation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646764","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4917991/","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Maximization for OFDMA Cooperative Relaying Networks with Fair Subchannel Allocation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S39P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0876S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4917991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4917994,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37310850100"},{"name":"Thomas Jost","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Jost","id":"37285041200"},{"name":"Christian Mensing","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Mensing","id":"37298726800"},{"name":"Armin Dammann","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Dammann","id":"37269758600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4917994","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":615},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Global Positioning System","Satellite navigation systems","Position measurement","Bit error rate","Bandwidth","Delay","Communications Society","Gain measurement","Radio navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","microcellular radio","mobile satellite communication","Monte Carlo methods","satellite navigation","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time based localization","terrestrial cellular mobile radio","time-difference-of-arrival","Global Navigation Satellite Systems","line-of sight","Gaussian distribution","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ToA and TDoA Error Models for NLoS Propagation Based on Outdoor to Indoor Channel Measurement","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04917994.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917994","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4917994","abstract":"Time Based (TB) localization in terrestrial cellular mobile radio as a complementation to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) has gained plenty of focuses.

In this approach, fixed transmit power has been assumed. Instead of just making a binary decision, we employ a new approach where the allowable maximum transmit power level is selected from the prepared transmit power levels with the constraint on the miss detection probability which guarantees the primary user performance.

The effect of error propagation of channel prediction is mitigated by the de-interleaver that is embedded in the Turbo receiver. The predicted and interpolated channel is refined through the channel estimator that uses the soft estimates of the symbols at each Turbo iteration. Due to the bandlimiting feature of the varying channel, the estimation errors are smoothed by the low-pass filters that follow the channel estimator. Simulation results show that incorporating Turbo equalization with channel prediction and iterative channel estimation can combat fast channel variation and improve reception performance.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04918006.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4918006","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4918006","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4918006","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Iterative decoding","Finite impulse response filter","Equalizers","Intersymbol interference","Frequency estimation","Iterative algorithms","Nonlinear filters","Broadband communication","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","channel coding","channel estimation","equalisers","interleaved codes","interpolation","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","mobile radio","time-varying channels","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo receiver equalization","channel prediction error propagation","iterative channel estimation","mobile broadband communication","information bit frame","time-varying radio channel","maximum-a-posteriori probability equalizer","maximum-a-posteriori probability demapper","maximum-a-posteriori probability decoder","channel interpolation","iterative decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4918006/","displayDocTitle":"Turbo Equalization with Channel Prediction and Iterative Channel Estimation","accessionNumber":"10646779","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4918006/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo Equalization with Channel Prediction and Iterative Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S22P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059769S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4918006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4918007,"authors":[{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shaodan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37280187300"},{"name":"Tung-Sang Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Tung-Sang","lastName":"Ng","id":"37280168200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4918007","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","OFDM","Equalizers","Interference cancellation","Intersymbol interference","Statistics","Multiple access interference","State estimation","Channel state information","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","equalisers","higher order statistics","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","signal detection","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-step signal detection algorithm","MIMO-OFDM system","structural property","received OFDM symbol","inter-carrier interference cancellation","inter-symbol interference cancellation","equalizer","second-order statistics","multi antenna interference","channel state information estimation","transmit antenna"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a MIMO-OFDM system without cyclic prefix (CP) is considered and a two-step signal detection algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is based on some structural properties derived from shifting the received OFDM symbols.

The second step detects the signals from the equalizer output in which the signals are still corrupted with multi- antenna interference (MAI). In the proposed algorithm, precise knowledge of the channel length is unnecessary and only one pilot OFDM symbol is utilized to estimate the required channel state information, assuming the number of transmit antennas is smaller than the number of subcarriers in one OFDM symbol. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable performance to algorithms for MIMO-OFDM system with cyclic prefix and it is robust against channel length overestimation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Step Signal Detection for MIMO-OFDM Systems without Cyclic Prefix","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2009.4918007","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4917480/4917481/04918007.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2009.4918007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4918007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4918007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Two-Step Signal Detection for MIMO-OFDM Systems without Cyclic Prefix","conferenceDate":"5-8 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4918007/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646780","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Step Signal Detection for MIMO-OFDM Systems without Cyclic Prefix","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"T01S44P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067857S","chronDate":"5-8 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4917480","isNumber":"4917481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4917480","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4917481","articleId":"4918007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4918009,"authors":[{"name":"Piming Ma","affiliation":["UWB Communication Research Center, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Piming","lastName":"Ma","id":"37425433400"},{"name":"Kyungsup Kwak","affiliation":["UWB Communication Research Center, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungsup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2948-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2947-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4918009","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Parity check codes","Gaussian approximation","Image communication","Iterative decoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Partitioning algorithms","AWGN channels","Peer to peer computing","Ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","AWGN channels","Gaussian distribution","parity check codes","tree codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unequal error protection","low density parity check codes","Gaussian approximation","image transmission","AWGN channel","uncompressed image","set partitioning into hierarchical trees"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4918009","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a scheme to design unequal error protection low-density parity-check (UEP-LDPC) codes based on Gaussian approximation algorithm over AWGN channel.

The results also prove the efficacy and correctness of the method.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2009.4918059","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4918025/4918026/04918059.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2009.4918059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4918026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Advanced Genetic Algorithm for Optimal Unit Commitment of Power System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Power systems","Costs","Power system economics","Ant colony optimization","Dynamic programming","Testing","Meeting planning","Fuels","Power generation economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power generation dispatch","power generation scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","optimal unit commitment","power system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4918059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Advanced Genetic Algorithm for Optimal Unit Commitment of Power System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4918059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"27-31 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10661941","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Advanced Genetic Algorithm for Optimal Unit Commitment of Power System","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-07-60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085866S","chronDate":"27-31 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4918025","isNumber":"4918026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4918025","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4918026","articleId":"4918059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4918068,"authors":[{"name":"Weimin Qi","affiliation":["Phys. & Inf.

FACTS controllers can offer great opportunities in modern power system, allowing better and safer operation of the grid. Their technical benefits are very well acknowledged, but there are some factors limiting the widespread of this technology: a) lack of a comprehensive consideration of FACTS for multiple operational problems and operational conditions, b) lack of economic assessment of FACTS projects for utilities and transmission entities [1] c) lack of a clear understanding of the options of devices and their configurations [1], and most importantly d) the high degree of uncertainty associated with the transmission system on the time scale that is needed to assess this kind of long-term projects. This paper gives a brief introduction of various FACTS devices and their controllers, main research methods. We mainly provide a survey of FACTS' economic assessment method proposed so far. We conclude that there is a huge literature body of technical benefits associated with FACTS targeting on single operational problems, but limited work on addressing their practical application considerations, and economic evaluation, offering great research opportunities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4918115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-31 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4918115/","accessionNumber":"10661995","displayDocTitle":"A Review of FACTS' Practical Consideration and Economic Evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of FACTS' Practical Consideration and Economic Evaluation","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"04-02-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073151S","chronDate":"27-31 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4918025","isNumber":"4918026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4918025","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4918026","articleId":"4918115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4918162,"authors":[{"name":"Yingjun Wu","affiliation":["Sch. of Electr.

In order to analyze the effects of the damping characteristic of the system oscillations with TCSC in this new grid structure, three cases have been adopted: the normal AC system with HVDC lines, the system with FSC and HVDC lines, the system with FSC+TCSC and HVDC lines. The results showed that TCSC not only can inhibit the SSO, but also can improve the damping characteristic performance of the transmission system with HVDC. The results also demonstrated that the impedance characteristic of TCSC is related with the value of conduction angle, which will affect the damping characteristic performance of system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4918162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 March 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-31 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4918162/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10662042","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Subsynchronous Oscillation (SSO) Damping Characteristic of the AC/HVDC Parallel Transmission System Using TCSC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Subsynchronous Oscillation (SSO) Damping Characteristic of the AC/HVDC Parallel Transmission System Using TCSC","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"04-02-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041346S","chronDate":"27-31 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4918025","isNumber":"4918026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4918025","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4918026","articleId":"4918162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4918164,"authors":[{"name":"Dongxin Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Dongxin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37635907300"},{"name":"Zhibin Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279724100"},{"name":"Xiang Cui","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Cui","id":"37269033800"},{"name":"Jiahong Chen","affiliation":["Wuhan High-Voltage Research Institute, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jiahong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406653700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2487-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2486-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4847"}],"articleNumber":"4918164","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductivity","Lightning","Finite difference methods","Electromagnetic radiation","Electromagnetic fields","Time domain analysis","Numerical models","Transmission lines","Electromagnetic modeling","Soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical resistivity","electromagnetic fields","finite difference time-domain analysis","lightning","transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ground resistivity effects","lightning radiation electromagnetic fields","FDTD method","lightning return-stroke","three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain numerical model","lightning current transmission line model","soil resistivities","monolayer ground"]}],"abstract":"In order to investigate effects of ground resistivity on the lightning radiation electromagnetic fields produced by lightning return-stroke, a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical model is developed with lightning current's transmission line model.

The computed results indicate that the resistivity of the monolayer ground has greater effects on the lightning radiation electric field than the magnetic field.

By comparing the average frequency of the extracted signals, which measured by the phase information of wavelet transformation, an internal or external fault can be distinguished definitely. Due to the IRWT update only using previous values and regardless of the sampling rate, the proposed algorithm reduces computational complexity, improves the real-time capability and is very desirable for ultra-high-speed protection.

Distributed Generation is by definition that which is of limited size (roughly 10 MW or less) and interconnected at the substation, distribution feeder or customer load levels. The DG technologies are entering a period of rapid expansion and commercialization. The increasing load demand may violate the consumer's voltage permissible limits. While considering the tariff issues, the reduction in losses has a major role to play. With so many problems and so much new Distributed Generation being installed, it is critical that the power system impacts be assessed accurately so that DG can be applied in a manner that avoids causing desired. This paper presents an algorithm for proper Distributed Generation (DG) allocation in distribution systems, in order to minimize the electrical network losses and to guarantee acceptable voltage profile. The optimization process is a load flow base algorithm.

The forecasted solar irradiance is exactly the algebraic sum of all the forecasted components obtained by the respective networks, which correspond respectively the time-frequency domains. On the basis of combination of chaos optimization neural network and wavelet analysis, a model is developed for more accurate forecasts of solar irradiance.

The method is introduced that using GA optimizes PPF parameters in this thesis.

First discuss several harmonic suppression methods have been adopted in practice, such as increasing the pulse number of converter, using pulse width modulation (PWM) converter, passive power filter (PPF) equipment, active power filter (APF) equipment and so on, among these hybrid type combining PPF and APF is the most economical and effective method, so hybrid type equipment is applied to suppress harmonics that are brought by grid- connected DG. From three respects of the cost, the DG penetration power and the total harmonic distortion (THD), using GA optimizes the PPF parameters, namely R, L, C, optimization results make the PPF cost is the most economical, the DG penetration power is the largest and the THD is the smallest, simulation shows this method is effective.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2009.4918401","pdfPath":"/iel5/4918025/4918026/04918401.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2009.4918401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4918026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic Suppression of Grid-Connected Distributed Generation Using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4918401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic Suppression of Grid-Connected Distributed Generation Using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10662280","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4918401/","conferenceDate":"27-31 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic Suppression of Grid-Connected Distributed Generation Using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-07-45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056776S","chronDate":"27-31 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4918025","isNumber":"4918026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4918025","xplore-issue":"4918026","articleId":"4918401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4918409,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Rong","affiliation":["Inst. of Water Resources & Hydro-Electr.

This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model using Pareto improvement from the view of supervision institution which takes charge of design, supervision and management of power market. Direct power-purchase volume proportion, floating ratio of time-of-use(TOU) transmission price and grid-supplied price are chosen as control variables to formulate the problem. The model presented in this paper has two objective of economy and environment consideration with some constraints including network loss, emission, price, market power, and so on and the model can optimize the control variables without benefit loss of any participant. The essential of the problem is to utilize price elasticity matrix of large customer to adjust profit distribution and to achieve the social integrated benefit optimization.

A precise electric power system short term load forecasting will lead to economic cost saving and right decisions on generating electric power. Electric power load is difficult to be forecasted accurately for its complicacy and uncertainty if no numerical algorithm model is applied. In order to improve the precision of electric power system short term load forecasting, a new model is put forward in this paper. Both particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and radial basis function(RBF) neural network are taken into use in this paper. PSO is a novel random optimization method which has been found to be powerful in solving nonlinear optimization problems. In this paper, PSO is applied to optimize the weighting factor of neural network. Theoretical analysis and simulation prove that the load forecasting model which optimized by PSO is more accurate than the traditional RBF neural network model.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2009.4918588","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2009.4918588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4918026","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4918025/4918026/04918588.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization-Based RBF Neural Network Load Forecasting Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4918588/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization-Based RBF Neural Network Load Forecasting Model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4918588/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10662467","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"27-31 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization-Based RBF Neural Network Load Forecasting Model","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"03-06-40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04009S","chronDate":"27-31 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4918025","isNumber":"4918026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4918025","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4918026","articleId":"4918588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4918603,"authors":[{"name":"Huimin Yu","affiliation":["Inst. of Electron., Chinese Acad. of Sci., Beijing"],"firstName":"Huimin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37088157490"},{"name":"Guangyou Fang","affiliation":["Inst. of Electron., Chinese Acad. of Sci., Beijing"],"firstName":"Guangyou","lastName":"Fang","id":"37088154390"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2487-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2486-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4847"}],"articleNumber":"4918603","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power distribution","Ground penetrating radar","Field programmable gate arrays","Impedance","Capacitors","Voltage","Regulators","Capacitance","Process design","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","ground penetrating radar","radar receivers","voltage regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power distribution system design","FPGA-based ground-penetrating radar receiver","field programmable gate array","transient current","target impedance calculation","bypass capacitor determination","voltage regulator module design","interplanar capacitance calculation"]}],"abstract":"Power distribution system (PDS) development of compact, low-cost ground penetrating radar (GPR) receiver based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) environment is presented.

As a result, these protections have a low correct action rate. According to the feature of HVDC transmission system, this paper studies the characteristics of the natural boundary composed of the smoothing reactor and the DC filters. It is proved that this boundary has obvious differences in attenuation characteristics of different frequency components of fault transient signals. Consequently, a non-unit transient-based protection (NUTBP) is proposed. Wavelet multi-resolution signal decomposition technique is used to analyze the transient current caused by the faults. Extensive simulation results indicate that non-unit transient protection can clear all faults on the whole line quickly and credibly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4918025/4918026/04918793.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2009.4918793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2009.4918793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4918026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4918793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Non-Unit Transient-Based Protection for HVDC Transmission Lines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","HVDC transmission","Power system transients","Transient analysis","Smoothing methods","Inductors","Filters","Attenuation","Frequency","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power transmission","power filters","power system transients","power transmission faults","power transmission lines","power transmission protection","signal resolution","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC transmission line protection","nonunit transient-based protection","smoothing reactor","DC filter","fault transient signal","wavelet multiresolution signal decomposition technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4918793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Study of Non-Unit Transient-Based Protection for HVDC Transmission Lines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4918793/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10662672","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","conferenceDate":"27-31 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Non-Unit Transient-Based Protection for HVDC Transmission Lines","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"04-02-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051086S","chronDate":"27-31 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4918025","isNumber":"4918026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4918025","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4918026","articleId":"4918793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4918910,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Fan","affiliation":["missile Inst., Air Force Eng.

Transmit Power Control for Cognitive Radio","abstract":"A cognitive radio network is a multiuser system, in which different users compete for limited resources in an opportunistic manner, interacting with each other for access to the available resources. The fact that both users and spectrum holes (i.e., unused spectrum subbands) can come and go makes a cognitive radio network a highly dynamic and challenging wireless environment. Therefore, finding robust resource-allocation algorithms, which are capable of achieving reasonably good solutions fast enough in order to guarantee an acceptable level of performance under worst case interference conditions, is crucial in such environment. The focus of this paper is the transmit-power control in cognitive radio networks, considering a noncooperative framework. Moreover, tools from control theory are used to study both the equilibrium and transient behaviors of the network under dynamically varying conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4919186/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2009","volume":"97","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"10665033","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Transmit Power Control for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Transmit Power Control for Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"jproc-setoodeh-2015718.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110181S","chronDate":"May  2009","isNumber":"4919177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"143","articleId":"4919186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4919240,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Yu Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Yu","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37631630400"},{"name":"Chun-Fei Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Fei","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37276771800"},{"name":"Chih-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278409600"},{"name":"Tsu-Tian Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsu-Tian","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277271100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3491-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3492-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4919240","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Brushless DC motors","Neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Control systems","Robust control","Adaptive systems","Attenuation","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","brushless DC motors","control system synthesis","gradient methods","Lyapunov methods","machine control","neurocontrollers","position control","recurrent neural nets","robust control","tracking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive position tracking control","recurrent wavelet neural network","robust controller design","neural controller","online mimic","L2 tracking","Lyapunov stability theorem","gradient decent method","brushless DC motor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4919240","abstract":"An adaptive position tracking control (APTC) system, which is composed of a neural controller and a robust controller, is proposed in this paper.

This method aims for reducing the offset error caused by a parallel feedforward compensator (PFC) required to achieve the almost strictly positive real (ASPR) condition. The real plant together with the PFC will form an augmented plant that satisfies the ASPR condition. In this proposed method, the control input for the nonlinear plant is given by the sum of the output of a simple adaptive controller and the output of neural networks, while only a part of control input produced by SAC is fed to the PFC. The role of neural networks is to compensate the nonlinearities in the control system by using backpropagation learning algorithm. The role of simple adaptive controller is to perform the model matching for the linear system with unknown structures to a given linear reference model. Since only part of the SAC control input is fed to the PFC, the offset error will be reduced by the control system. Thus, both of the augmented plant output and the real plant output can follow significantly close to the output of the reference model. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is confirmed through computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2009.4919280","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907391/4919225/04919280.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"249","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSC.2009.4919280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4919225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple adaptive control using neural networks with offset error reduction for SISO nonlinear systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4919280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simple adaptive control using neural networks with offset error reduction for SISO nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10645985","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4919280/","conferenceDate":"26-29 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple adaptive control using neural networks with offset error reduction for SISO nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Okayama, Japan","sourcePdf":"FriM04-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0492S","chronDate":"26-29 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907391","isNumber":"4919225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907391","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4919225","articleId":"4919280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4919330,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Kang","affiliation":["University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Qi Kang","id":"37087269798"},{"name":"Jing An","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jing An","id":"37087371070"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lei Wang","id":"37087209463"},{"name":"Qidi Wu","affiliation":["University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Qidi Wu","id":"37087199807"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3491-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3492-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4919330","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4919330","abstract":"This paper presents a study of dynamic optimal control for a stochastic PSO system.

Results from tests also show how fast arcs can lengthen and evolve to multiple phases, and performance of conductor covers was evaluated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4919429/","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10645654","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4919429/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Arc flash analysis approaches for medium-voltage distribution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arc flash analysis approaches for medium-voltage distribution","confLoc":"Fort Collins, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"C-5TomShort.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049864S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2009","isNumber":"4919407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4812965","citationCount":"8","articleId":"4919429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4919491,"authors":[{"name":"Prem Pal","affiliation":["Department of Micro-Nano systems Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Prem","lastName":"Pal","id":"37624108600"},{"name":"Kazuo Sato","affiliation":["Department of Micro-Nano systems Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Sato","id":"37292604700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3874-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4919491","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Microfluidics","Microstructure","Lithography","Fabrication","Shape","Wafer bonding","Oxidation","CMOS process","Anisotropic magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","elemental semiconductors","etching","microfabrication","microfluidics","organic compounds","oxidation","photolithography","silicon","silicon compounds","surfactants","wafer bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon microfluidic channels","microstructures","photolithography step","(100)-silicon wafers","wafer bonding","silicon nitride","intermediate layer","local oxidation","complementary metal oxide semiconductor process","wet anisotropic etching","nonionic surfactant Triton-X-100","tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide solutions","Si-Si3N4"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a fabrication method of suspended silicon microfluidic channels and various shapes of microstructures of desired thickness in (100)-Si wafers using single photolithography step is presented.

In recent years, chip-level infrared (IR) thermal imaging has been gaining popularity in studying thermal phenomena and thermal management, as well as reverse-engineering chip power consumption. Unfortunately, IR thermal imaging needs a peculiar cooling solution, which removes the heatsink and applies an IR-transparent liquid flow over the exposed bare die to carry away the dissipated heat. Because this cooling solution is drastically different from a normal thermal package, its thermal characteristics need to be closely examined. In this paper, we characterize the differences between two cooling configurations-forced air flow over a copper heatsink (AIR-SINK) and laminar oil flow over bare silicon (OIL-SILICON). For the comparison, we modify the HotSpot thermal model by adding the IR-transparent oil flow and the secondary heat transfer path through the package pins, hence modeling what the IR camera actually sees at runtime. We show that OIL-SILICON and AIR-SINK are significantly different in both transient and steady-state thermal responses. OIL-SILICON has a much slower short-term transient response, which makes dynamic thermal management less efficient. In addition, for OIL-SILICON, the direction of oil flow plays an important role by changing hot spot location, thus impacting hot spot identification and thermal sensor placement. These results imply that the power- and temperature-aware design process cannot just rely on IR measurements. Simulation and IR measurement are both needed and are complementary techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919633","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907867/4919623/04919633.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4919623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differentiating the roles of IR measurement and simulation for power and temperature-aware design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4919633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4919633/","displayDocTitle":"Differentiating the roles of IR measurement and simulation for power and temperature-aware design","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646112","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4919633/","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differentiating the roles of IR measurement and simulation for power and temperature-aware design","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092278S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907867","isNumber":"4919623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907867","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4919623","articleId":"4919633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4919636,"authors":[{"name":"Niket Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Niket","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37543361900"},{"name":"Tushar Krishna","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Tushar","lastName":"Krishna","id":"37540652000"},{"name":"Li-Shiuan Peh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Li-Shiuan","lastName":"Peh","id":"37274794400"},{"name":"Niraj K.

On-chip communication was frequently ignored. This was because of fast, single-cycle on-chip communication. The interconnect power was also insignificant compared to the transistor power. With uniprocessor designs providing diminishing returns and the advent of chip multiprocessors (CMPs) in mainstream systems, the on-chip network that connects different processing cores has become a critical part of the design. Transistor miniaturization has led to high global wire delay, and interconnect power comparable to transistor power. CMP design proposals can no longer ignore the interaction between the memory hierarchy and the interconnection network that connects various elements. This necessitates a detailed and accurate interconnection network model within a full-system evaluation framework. Ignoring the interconnect details might lead to inaccurate results when simulating a CMP architecture. It also becomes important to analyze the impact of interconnection network optimization techniques on full system behavior. In this light, we developed a detailed cycle-accurate interconnection network model (GARNET), inside the GEMS full-system simulation framework. GARNET models a classic five-stage pipelined router with virtual channel (VC) flow control. Microarchitectural details, such as flit-level input buffers, routing logic, allocators and the crossbar switch, are modeled. GARNET, along with GEMS, provides a detailed and accurate memory system timing model. To demonstrate the importance and potential impact of GARNET, we evaluate a shared and private L2 CMP with a realistic state-of-the-art interconnection network against the original GEMS simple network. The objective of the evaluation was to figure out which configuration is better for a particular workload. We show that not modeling the interconnect in detail might lead to an incorrect outcome. We also evaluate Express Virtual Channels (EVCs), an on-chip network flow control proposal, in a full-system fashion. We show that in improving on-chip network latency-throughput, EVCs do lead to better overall system runtime, however, the impact varies widely across applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919636","startPage":"33","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907867/4919623/04919636.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919636","endPage":"42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4919623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GARNET: A detailed on-chip network model inside a full-system simulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4919636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"GARNET: A detailed on-chip network model inside a full-system simulator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4919636/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10646115","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GARNET: A detailed on-chip network model inside a full-system simulator","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061274S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907867","isNumber":"4919623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907867","citationCount":"413","xplore-issue":"4919623","articleId":"4919636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4919638,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel H.

Converting existing sequential applications as well as developing next-generation software requires assistance from hardware, compilers and runtime systems to exploit parallelism transparently within applications. These systems must decompose applications into tasks that can be executed in parallel and then schedule those tasks to minimize load imbalance. However, many systems lack a priori knowledge about the execution time of all tasks to perform effective load balancing with low scheduling overhead. In this paper, we approach this fundamental problem using machine learning techniques first to generate performance models for all tasks and then applying those models to perform automatic performance prediction across program executions. We also extend an existing scheduling algorithm to use generated task cost estimates for online task partitioning and scheduling. We implement the above techniques in the pR framework, which transparently parallelizes scripts in the popular R language, and evaluate their performance and overhead with both a real-world application and a large number of synthetic representative test scripts. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly improves task partitioning and scheduling, with maximum improvements of 21.8%, 40.3% and 22.1% and average improvements of 15.9%, 16.9% and 4.2% for LMM (a real R application) and synthetic test cases with independent and dependent tasks, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919641","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907867/4919623/04919641.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"100","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4919623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine learning based online performance prediction for runtime parallelization and task scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4919641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Machine learning based online performance prediction for runtime parallelization and task scheduling","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10646120","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4919641/","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine learning based online performance prediction for runtime parallelization and task scheduling","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101493S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907867","isNumber":"4919623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907867","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4919623","articleId":"4919641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4919648,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Bakhoda","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Bakhoda","id":"37644290200"},{"name":"George L.

The combination of multiple, multithreaded, SIMD cores makes studying these GPUs useful in understanding tradeoffs among memory, data, and thread level parallelism. While modern GPUs offer orders of magnitude more raw computing power than contemporary CPUs, many important applications, even those with abundant data level parallelism, do not achieve peak performance. This paper characterizes several non-graphics applications written in NVIDIA's CUDA programming model by running them on a novel detailed microarchitecture performance simulator that runs NVIDIA's parallel thread execution (PTX) virtual instruction set. For this study, we selected twelve non-trivial CUDA applications demonstrating varying levels of performance improvement on GPU hardware (versus a CPU-only sequential version of the application). We study the performance of these applications on our GPU performance simulator with configurations comparable to contemporary high-end graphics cards. We characterize the performance impact of several microarchitecture design choices including choice of interconnect topology, use of caches, design of memory controller, parallel workload distribution mechanisms, and memory request coalescing hardware. Two observations we make are (1) that for the applications we study, performance is more sensitive to interconnect bisection bandwidth rather than latency, and (2) that, for some applications, running fewer threads concurrently than on-chip resources might otherwise allow can improve performance by reducing contention in the memory system.","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919648","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907867/4919623/04919648.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4919623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing CUDA workloads using a detailed GPU simulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4919648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analyzing CUDA workloads using a detailed GPU simulator","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646127","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4919648/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing CUDA workloads using a detailed GPU simulator","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095247S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907867","isNumber":"4919623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907867","citationCount":"873","xplore-issue":"4919623","articleId":"4919648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4919649,"authors":[{"name":"Randy Smith","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Randy","lastName":"Smith","id":"37634423100"},{"name":"Neelam Goyal","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Neelam","lastName":"Goyal","id":"37638372200"},{"name":"Justin Ormont","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Ormont","id":"37644273600"},{"name":"Karthikeyan Sankaralingam","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Karthikeyan","lastName":"Sankaralingam","id":"37398408100"},{"name":"Cristian Estan","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Estan","id":"37298119200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4184-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4919649","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":640},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Automata","Inspection","Intrusion detection","Telecommunication traffic","Load management","Heart","Engines","Payloads","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","computer networks","deterministic automata","digital signatures","field programmable gate arrays","finite automata","microprocessor chips","parallel architectures","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network packet signature matching","network device","packet inspection","intrusion detection","traffic shaping","load balancing","packet payload","regular-expression based signature","network speed","performance requirement","hardware-centric ASIC-FPGA implementation","high-performance microprocessor","programmable signature matching system","Nvidia G80 GPU","microarchitectural analysis","SIMD processing","standard deterministic finite automata","extended finite automata","SIMD-based G80 GPU"]}],"abstract":"Modern network devices employ deep packet inspection to enable sophisticated services such as intrusion detection, traffic shaping, and load balancing. At the heart of such services is a signature matching engine that must match packet payloads to multiple signatures at line rates. However, the recent transition to complex regular-expression based signatures coupled with ever-increasing network speeds has rapidly increased the performance requirements of signature matching. Solutions to meet these requirements range from hardware-centric ASIC/FPGA implementations to software implementations using high-performance microprocessors. In this paper, we propose a programmable signature matching system prototyped on an Nvidia G80 GPU. We first present a detailed architectural and microarchitectural analysis, showing that signature matching is well suited for SIMD processing because of regular control flow and parallelism available at the packet level. Next, we examine two approaches for matching signatures: standard deterministic finite automata (DFAs) and extended finite automata (XFAs), which use far less memory than DFAs but require specialized auxiliary memory and small amounts of computation in most states. We implement a fully functional prototype on the SIMD-based G80 GPU. This system out-performs a Pentium4 by up to 9X and a Niagara-based 32-threaded system by up to 2.3X and shows that GPUs are a promising candidate for signature matching.","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919649","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907867/4919623/04919649.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4919623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating GPUs for network packet signature matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4919649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4919649/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating GPUs for network packet signature matching","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10646128","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4919649/","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating GPUs for network packet signature matching","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089859S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907867","isNumber":"4919623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907867","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4919623","articleId":"4919649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"}]
