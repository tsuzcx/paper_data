The modifications are mandatory to eliminate the error that conventional AHN structure is reported to suffer from. This error originates from the mapping process, the corner stone in using AHN as an optimization tool. A new solution algorithm is developed by combining the AHN with the proposed modifications. In order to verify the effectiveness of the new algorithm, it is applied and tested to some examples reported in literature and the solution is then compared with that obtained by counterpart artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Unlike other AI techniques, the solution obtained using the modified AHN is more optimal and satisfying all the operating constraints.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2009.5260222","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2009.5260222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260217","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230481/5260217/05260222.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified augmented hopfield neural network for optimal thermal unit commitment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5260222/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modified augmented hopfield neural network for optimal thermal unit commitment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5260222/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10903219","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified augmented hopfield neural network for optimal thermal unit commitment","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"PESGM2009000389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.159814S","chronDate":"26-30 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230481","isNumber":"5260217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230481","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5260217","articleId":"5260222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5260411,"authors":[{"name":"Jong Hwan Ahn","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Myongji University, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong Hwan","lastName":"Ahn","id":"38258179000"},{"name":"Tae Yoon Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Myongji University, Korea"],"firstName":"Tae Yoon","lastName":"Kang","id":"37085917988"},{"name":"Woo Yeop Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Myongji University, Korea"],"firstName":"Woo Yeop","lastName":"Lim","id":"38240187800"},{"name":"Seungsoo Han","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Myongji University, Korea"],"firstName":"Seungsoo","lastName":"Han","id":"37694389500"},{"name":"Hack Man Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Incheon City College, Korea"],"firstName":"Hack Man","lastName":"Kim","id":"38258028200"},{"name":"Sang Jeen Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Myongji University, Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Jeen","lastName":"Hong","id":"37278990900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3687-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5260411","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Character generation","Hybrid power systems","Semiconductor process modeling","Manufacturing processes","Semiconductor device manufacture","Semiconductor device modeling","Plasma materials processing","Time to market"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","production engineering computing","semiconductor industry","semiconductor process modelling","silicon compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RepTor","intelligent hybrid neural network","recipe generator","semiconductor process modeling","process optimization","nonlinear plasma process","semiconductor manufacturing","particle swamp optimization","process setup","deposition process","wafer geometry","SiO2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5260411","abstract":"An intelligent hybrid neural network based recipe generator is presented as a convenient tool for process optimization typically aiming highly-nonlinear plasma process in semiconductor manufacturing.

Simulation results demonstrate that a compact and high performance fuzzy rule base can be constructed.

However, important algorithms such as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) present a far more complex search space consisting of many thousands of different implementations with very different complex access patterns and nesting and code structures. As a results, some of the best available FFT implementations use heuristic search based on runtime measurements. In this paper we present the first analytical model that can successfully replace the measurement in this search on modern platforms. The model includes many details of the platform's memory system including the TLBs, and, for the first time, physically addressed caches and hardware prefetching. The effect, as we show, is a dramatically reduced search time to find the best FFT without significant loss in performance. Even though our model is adapted to the FFT in this paper, its underlying structure should be applicable for a much larger set of code structures and hence is a candidate for iterative compilation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 18th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/5260496/5260497/05260521.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"280","publicationTitle":"2009 18th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2009.11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2009.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260497","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5260521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Tuning of Discrete Fourier Transforms Driven by Analytical Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Analytical models","Hardware","Flexible printed circuits","Runtime","Libraries","Spirals","Iterative algorithms","Context modeling","Tiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic programming","cache storage","discrete Fourier transforms","program compilers","program control structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","analytical modeling","tile sizes","loop nests","fast Fourier transforms","search space","heuristic search","runtime measurements","memory system","cache prefetching","hardware prefetching","code structures","iterative compilation","Spiral program generator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["automatic performance tuning","discrete Fourier transform","FFT","high-performance computing","library generators","model-driven optimization","program optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5260521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Tuning of Discrete Fourier Transforms Driven by Analytical Modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5260521/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10891801","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Tuning of Discrete Fourier Transforms Driven by Analytical Modeling","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"3771a271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06626S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5260496","isNumber":"5260497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5260496","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5260497","articleId":"5260521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5260553,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaorui Wang","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaorui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281385700"},{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407023100"},{"name":"Charles Lefurgy","affiliation":["IBM Research GmbH, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Lefurgy","id":"37265517300"},{"name":"Tom W.

While various power control strategies have been recently proposed, existing solutions are not scalable to control the power consumption of an entire large-scale data center, because these solutions are designed only for a single server or a rack enclosure. In a modern data center, however, power control needs to be enforced at three levels: rack enclosure, power distribution unit, and the entire data center, due to the physical and contractual power limits at each level. This paper presents SHIP, a highly scalable hierarchical power control architecture for large-scale data centers. SHIP is designed based on well-established control theory for analytical assurance of control accuracy and system stability. Empirical results on a physical testbed show that our control solution can provide precise power control, as well as power differentiations for optimized system performance. In addition, our extensive simulation results based on a real trace file demonstrate the efficacy of our control solution in large-scale data centers composed of thousands of servers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SHIP: Scalable Hierarchical Power Control for Large-Scale Data Centers","publicationTitle":"2009 18th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2009.34","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 18th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/5260496/5260497/05260553.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2009.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260497","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5260553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5260553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"SHIP: Scalable Hierarchical Power Control for Large-Scale Data Centers","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5260553/","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10891823","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SHIP: Scalable Hierarchical Power Control for Large-Scale Data Centers","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"3771a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074807S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5260496","isNumber":"5260497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5260496","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5260497","articleId":"5260553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5260554,"authors":[{"name":"Wangyuan Zhang","affiliation":["Intelligent Design of Efficient Architecture Laboratory (IDEAL), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Wangyuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37674720000"},{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["Intelligent Design of Efficient Architecture Laboratory (IDEAL), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Li","id":"37539272900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3771-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-795X"}],"articleNumber":"5260554","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":127,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":2047},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5260554","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change memory","Memory architecture","Phase change random access memory","Random access memory","Delay","Temperature","Analytical models","Error correction codes","Microprocessors","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency theory","DRAM chips","error correction codes","microassembling","optimisation","phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D die-stacking","durable memory architectures","3D integration technology","DRAM","microprocessor","wire-delay","alleviating memory latency","bandwidth constraints","power density","on-chip temperature","charge leakage","phase-change random access memory","PRAM","heat-driven programming mechanisms","through silicon vias","OS-level paging","error-correcting capability","ECC codes","endurance optimization"]}],"abstract":"Emerging three-dimensional (3D) integration technology allows for the direct placement of DRAM on top of a microprocessor, significantly reducing the wire-delay between the two and thereby alleviating memory latency and bandwidth constraints. However, the increase in power density of 3D technology leads to elevated on-chip temperature, which results in an exponential rise in charge leakage of DRAM. Consequently, the refresh frequency of 3D die-stacked DRAM needs to be doubled (or more) to retain data at the expense of additional power overhead. In this work, we investigate using phase-change random access memory (PRAM) as a promising candidate to achieve scalable, low power and thermal friendly memory system architecture in the upcoming 3D-stacking technology era. Using analytical model, circuit- and architectural-level simulations that capture both physical and electrical characteristics of PRAM, we show that the higher temperature of 3D chips is beneficial to PRAM power savings due to its unique, heat-driven programming mechanisms. Moreover, we show that the through silicon vias (TSVs) ubiquitously used in 3D implementations contribute further PRAM power savings due to their substantially lower resistance to the high PRAM programming current. To effectively integrate PRAM into a conventional memory hierarchy, we propose architecture and OS support to address its write latency and reliability disadvantages. We present a hybrid PRAM/DRAM memory architecture and exploit an OS-level paging scheme to improve PRAM write performance and lifetime. Moreover, we leverage the error-correcting capability of strong ECC codes to expand PRAM lifespan and use wear-out aware OS page allocation to minimize ECC performance overhead. Our experimental results show that compared to die-stacked planar DRAM, our design reduces the overall power consumption of the memory system by 54% with 6% performance degradation, consequently alleviating the thermal constraint of 3D chips by up to 4.25degC and achieving a speedup of up to 1.1X. We also show that the lifetime can be improved by a factor of 114X using the proposed endurance optimization schemes.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2009.30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2009.30","publicationTitle":"2009 18th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 18th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/5260496/5260497/05260554.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Phase Change Memory and 3D Die-Stacking for Power/Thermal Friendly, Fast and Durable Memory Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5260554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploring Phase Change Memory and 3D Die-Stacking for Power/Thermal Friendly, Fast and Durable Memory Architectures","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10891824","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5260554/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Phase Change Memory and 3D Die-Stacking for Power/Thermal Friendly, Fast and Durable Memory Architectures","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"3771a101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09469S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5260496","isNumber":"5260497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5260496","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"5260497","articleId":"5260554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5260611,"authors":[{"name":"Pakorn Leesuthipornchai","affiliation":["King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, TH"],"firstName":"Pakorn","lastName":"Leesuthipornchai","id":"37088194476"},{"name":"Naruemon Wattanapongsakorn","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, King Mongkut''s University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand","Department of Computer Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Naruemon","lastName":"Wattanapongsakorn","id":"37282793700"},{"name":"Chalermpol Charnsripinyo","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Pathumthani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chalermpol","lastName":"Charnsripinyo","id":"37428589500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3687-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5260611","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength routing","Wavelength assignment","WDM networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical fiber networks","Optical design","Genetic algorithms","Design optimization","Computer networks","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","optical fibre networks","telecommunication network routing","wavelength assignment","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective network design","routing wavelength assignment","WDM networks","source-destination pairs","wavelength channel","genetic algorithm","minimum degree first wavelength assignment","fixed-alternate routing-first-fit wavelength assignment","CPU computation time","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RWA","WDM optical network","optimization algorithm","Multi-Objective network design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5260611","abstract":"In this paper, we consider a multi-objective network design problem with static routing wavelength assignment (RWA) in WDM networks.

Neural networks (NN) are considered the most powerful classifier for their low classification error rates and robustness to noise. But NN usually require long time to train the huge amount of data of large databases and lack explanation facilities for their knowledge. Therefore, we combine RS and NN for autonomous decision-making, with high accuracy, robustness to noise, efficiency, and good understandability. First, generate the decision rules based on RS, then construct the NN with the hidden layer representing decision rules, and learn the arguments of the NN with BP algorithm. With the direction of RS, NN neednpsilat long time for training, and the knowledge buried in their structures and weights can be well explained by decision rule on RS.

The new technique utilizes a phase update algorithm to obtain the weight vector maximizing the SINR (signal to interference plus noise ratio) of the received signal. It is observed that the proposed algorithm generates a suboptimal weight vector with a linear computational load(O(6N+8)). From the various simulations, it is confirmed that, when the signal environment becomes adverse, the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional one in terms of the communication capacity by about 3 times. Applying the proposed algorithm to W-CDMA mobile communication system, we have found that both communication capacity and communication quality are significantly improved.","doi":"10.1109/NISS.2009.274","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on New Trends in Information and Service Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on New Trends in Information and Service Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5260408/5260409/05260910.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NISS.2009.274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260409","startPage":"740","endPage":"742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Smart Antenna System Using a Phase Update Method in W-CDMA Signal Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5260910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Smart Antenna System Using a Phase Update Method in W-CDMA Signal Environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2009-July 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5260910/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10891765","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5260910/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Smart Antenna System Using a Phase Update Method in W-CDMA Signal Environment","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3687a740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044405S","chronDate":"June 30 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5260408","isNumber":"5260409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5260408","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5260409","articleId":"5260910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5260946,"authors":[{"name":"Chae-Up Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Mobile Communications Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chae-Up","lastName":"Yoo","id":"38101491600"},{"name":"Min-Su Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mobile Communications Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min-Su","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404419900"},{"name":"Youngoo Yang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngoo","lastName":"Yang","id":"38200968600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3687-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5260946","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Power transmission lines","Voltage","Mobile communication","Poles and towers","Frequency","Design engineering","Size control","Etching","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cables (electric)","harmonic analysis","mobile communication","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class-F amplifier","defected ground structure","mobile communication","feeder line combiner","feeder cable","antenna connection","harmonic control circuit","transistor parasitic parameters","secondary harmonic matching structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class F","Amplifier","DGS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5260946","abstract":"Recently at home and abroad mobile communication system has been rapidly developed. What draws our attention is the issue that systems which had been installed on the ground are gradually going up to the top of tower. Most designers must have long sought to get rid of the loss which occurs while moving up and down from an antenna installed on the top of tower to the system on the ground. In an attempt to remove the loss, the designers have used the feeder line combiner as a part which uses feeder cable for public use that connects an antenna to the system on the ground. The effort to improving the loss even in the feeder line combiner, however is still going on and it is just to move Amplifier to the top of tower from the ground. The improved loss by the change of system will attract a good deal of attention to higher efficiency Class-F Amplifier. When it comes to designing the previous structure of Class-F amplifier, the structure of Harmonic Control circuit considering Transistor parasitic parameters, made it possible to embody high efficiency. This study aims at the lightweight product.

However, demand paging has the page fault handling latency. To overcome this drawback, most operating systems take advantage of kernel-level read-ahead. On the contrary, in the compressed filesystem, kernel-level read-ahead degrades performance of demand paging. The main reason is that compressed filesystem has too large read-ahead miss penalty due to decompression overhead. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the conservative read-ahead technique, which improves demand paging performance of compressed filesystem. Proposed technique improves read throughput of device by bulk read from device and reduces decompression overhead of compressed filesystem by selective decompression. We implement conservative read-ahead technique by modifying CramFS and evaluate our implementation in the Linux kernel 2.6.21. Performance evaluation results show that proposed technique reduces the average major page fault handling latency by 28%.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSA.2009.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSA.2009.37","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5260889/5260890/05260952.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5260890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5260952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2009-July 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving Demand Paging Performance of Compressed Filesystem with NAND Flash Memory","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10891938","htmlLink":"/document/5260952/","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Demand Paging Performance of Compressed Filesystem with NAND Flash Memory","confLoc":"Yongin, Korea","sourcePdf":"3701a084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098349S","chronDate":"June 29 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5260889","isNumber":"5260890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5260889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5260890","articleId":"5260952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5261077,"authors":[{"name":"David Wilby","firstName":"David","lastName":"Wilby","id":"38108515300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3768-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5261077","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"abstract":"When charting new territory - enterprise-scale agile - traditional roadmaps only take you so far.

Three visualizations that form the foundation of a roadmap are described: (1) a driver map shows how the roadmapping team can best achieve objectives by linking customers' needs or applications to performance and to the technologies that will realize the team's objectives; (2) a time-based roadmap shows how the market or applications, solutions, and technologies evolve over time and how the roadmapping team will develop or acquire technologies or solutions; and (3) a strategic investment map provides a value and sourcing view of the portfolio of future technologies or solutions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Investments","Joining processes","Software maintenance","Software tools","Portfolios","Process planning","Strategic planning","User interfaces","Spreadsheet programs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cartography","data visualisation","driver information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["technology roadmapping","roadmapping team","complex visual information","roadmappers","roadmap information","roadmap story","strategic investment map"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5261837","doi":"10.1109/PICMET.2009.5261837","publicationTitle":"PICMET '09 - 2009 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"PICMET '09 - 2009 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5261733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICMET.2009.5261837","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230479/5261733/05261837.pdf","startPage":"2466","endPage":"2474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualization in strategic and technology roadmapping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visualization in strategic and technology roadmapping","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5261837/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10892358","conferenceDate":"2-6 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5261837/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualization in strategic and technology roadmapping","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"26309A0080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03384S","chronDate":"2-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230479","isNumber":"5261733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230479","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5261733","articleId":"5261837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"PICMET","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5261892,"authors":[{"name":"Maicon G.

A bibliographical review showed that technology roadmapping (TRM) and project portfolio management (PPM) are stand out methods for the front-end of NPD. This finding motivated the research question of our work: Can the integration of TRM and PPM contribute to improve the frontend of NPD? Hence, this paper evaluates the potential of this integration based on a case study at a high-tech company. The TRM applied here is based on the T-Plan developed at the University of Cambridge, and a sequence of steps and tools are proposed for PPM based on a synthesis of the findings of numerous authors. In this specific case, the front-end of NPD benefited from the integration. The set of product proposals were aligned with business and technological strategies, providing synchronization between market trends, NPD and new technology. Project portfolio management provides feedback for technology roadmapping. Therefore, the integration of NPD front-end methods appears to constitute a productive field of research and should be considered by hightech companies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of technology roadmapping and project portfolio management to improve the front-end of NPD process","publicationTitle":"PICMET '09 - 2009 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology","doi":"10.1109/PICMET.2009.5261892","displayPublicationTitle":"PICMET '09 - 2009 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230479/5261733/05261892.pdf","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICMET.2009.5261892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5261733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5261892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5261892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Integration of technology roadmapping and project portfolio management to improve the front-end of NPD process","conferenceDate":"2-6 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5261892/","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10892261","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of technology roadmapping and project portfolio management to improve the front-end of NPD process","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"21909R0156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069927S","chronDate":"2-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230479","isNumber":"5261733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230479","xplore-issue":"5261733","articleId":"5261892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"PICMET","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5261921,"authors":[{"name":"Marc J.

High efficiency, small size, and low cost are the main design goals. The incessant size reduction of handsets and their increased functionality will continue to put pressure on PA designers to achieve a high level of performance in even smaller packages by developing novel integration and packaging technologies. The handset PA module industry is severely challenged by cost and size. It is hard to justify any improvement in performance if it comes at a higher price tag or larger dimensions. These facts have prevented many technological advances, e.g., Chireix, Doherty and Kahn techniques, MEMS, reconfigurable matching networks, gallium nitride, etc., from being widely utilized today in handset PA modules.

Proposed inner soft sphere detection employs a variable upper bound for number of candidates per transmit antenna and utilizes the breath-first candidate-search algorithm. Upper bounds are based on probability distribution of the number of candidates found inside the spherical region formed around the received symbolvector. Detection accuracy of unbounded breadth-first candidatesearch is preserved while significant reduction of the search latency and area cost is achieved. This probabilistically bounded candidate-search algorithm improves error-rate performance of non-probabilistically bounded soft sphere detection algorithms, while providing smaller detection latency with same hardware resources. Prototype architecture of soft sphere detector is synthesized on Xilinx FPGA and for an ASIC design. Using area-cost of a single soft sphere detector, a level of processing parallelism required to achieve targeted high data rates for future wireless systems (for example, 1 Gbps data rate) is determined.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5262284/05262288.pdf","startPage":"1318","endPage":"1330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5262284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5262288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistically bounded soft sphere detection for MIMO-OFDM receivers: algorithm and system architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Upper bound","Delay","Detectors","Iterative decoding","MIMO","OFDM","Downlink","Transmitting antennas","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","iterative methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM receivers","system architecture","iterative soft detection","channel decoding","probabilistically bounded soft sphere detection","breath-first candidate-search algorithm","probability distribution","search latency","Xilinx FPGA","ASIC design","bit rate 1 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sphere detection, iterative detection-decoding, hardware implementation, FPGA prototype, ASIC synthesis, Gbps data throughput.

In particular, we propose two novel Space-Time (ST) block codes that are suitable for UWB. The proposed encoded MIMO-UWB schemes present the main advantage of conveying the information only through the positions of the very short unipolar UWB pulses. The constraint of unipolar transmissions keeps the transceiver structures very simple since it imposes no additional constraints on the RF circuitry to control the amplitudes or the phases of the sub-nanosecond UWB pulses. Consider the case where the transmitter is equipped with P antennas and where M PPM modulation positions are available. The first proposed scheme achieves a full transmit diversity order for M ges P while transmitting at the rate of log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(M) bits Per Channel Use (PCU).

The proposed codes permit to achieve different levels of compromise between complexity and performance since scheme 1 necessitates M-dimensional Maximum-Likelihood (ML) decoding while scheme 2 necessitates MP-dimensional decoding.

Therefore, traditional Impulse radio receivers demand non-practical implementation structures. In this paper we propose a novel correlation-adaptive receiver structure with low complexity for indoor high speed ultra wide band systems. This novel structure combines correlation characteristics from Rake receivers with recursive filters from adaptive receivers. The receiver includes a low complexity recursive channel estimation filter capable of estimating hundreds of channel impulse responses, and a single filter-correlation filter used for coherent bit demodulation.

High bit-rate OFDM transceivers based on the single-chip Si RF-CMOS IC technology in the 60-GHz millimeter-wave band have been extensively studied for wireless personal area network (WPAN) systems, and the relatively large phase noise in the phase locked loop (PLL) synthesizer severely degrades transmission performance. The proposed OFDM receiver iterates DD-PNC and decision-directed channel estimation (DDCE) by exploiting the output of the channel decoder. DDPNC estimates the phase noise each sampling time by using the decoder output, and then it removes the estimate from a time-domain received signal. In addition, DDCE estimates a channel impulse response by using the compensated received signal. Computer simulations demonstrate that in the 64QAM modulation with the coding rate of 3/4, the proposed receiver with DD-PNC and DDCE can perfectly remove the phase noise of -85 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, and that it can alleviate the degradation of the channel estimation due to the phase noise.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5262284/05262292.pdf","startPage":"1358","endPage":"1366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5262284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative receiver employing phase noise compensation and channel estimation for millimeter-wave OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5262292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262292/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative receiver employing phase noise compensation and channel estimation for millimeter-wave OFDM systems","volume":"27","issue":"8","publicationDate":"October 2009","accessionNumber":"10893436","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5262292/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative receiver employing phase noise compensation and channel estimation for millimeter-wave OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"1358jsac0809suyama.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082983S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5262284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5262284","articleId":"5262292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5262293,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Gutierrez","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group (WNCG), in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5262284/5262293/5262293-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Felix Gutierrez, Jr. (S' 08) received the B.S.E.E. degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 2006 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University in 2008.

The proposed BF protocol targets to minimize the BF set-up time and to mitigate the high path loss of 60 GHz WPAN systems. It consists of 3 stages, namely the device (DEV) to DEV linking, sector-level searching and beam-level searching. The division of the stages facilitates significant reduction in setup time as compared to BF protocols with exhaustive searching mechanisms. The proposed BF protocol employs discrete phase-shifters, which significantly simplifies the structure of DEVs as compared to the conventional BF with phase-and-amplitude adjustment, at the expense of a gain degradation of less than 1 dB. The proposed BF protocol is a complete design and PHY-independent, it is applicable to different antenna configurations. Simulation results show that the setup time of the proposed BF protocol is as small as 2% when compared to the exhaustive searching protocol. Furthermore, based on the codebooks with four phases per element, around 15.1 dB gain is achieved by using eight antenna elements at both transmitter and receiver, thereby enabling 1.6 Gbps-data-streaming over a range of three meters. Due to the flexibility in supporting multiple PHY layer designs, the proposed protocol has been adopted by the IEEE 802.15.3c as an optional functionality to realize Gbps communication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","volume":"27","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10893446","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5262295/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Beam codebook based beamforming protocol for multi-Gbps millimeter-wave WPAN systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam codebook based beamforming protocol for multi-Gbps millimeter-wave WPAN systems","sourcePdf":"1390jsac0809wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062151S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5262284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"426","xplore-issue":"5262284","articleId":"5262295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5262296,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Our approach accounts for the following two characteristics that sharply distinguish mm wave networking from that at lower carrier frequencies. First, mm wave links are inherently directional: directivity is required to overcome the higher path loss at smaller wavelengths, and it is feasible with compact, low-cost circuit board antenna arrays. Second, indoor mm wave links are highly susceptible to blockage because of the limited ability to diffract around obstacles such as the human body and furniture. We develop a diffraction-based model to determine network link connectivity as a function of the locations of stationary and moving obstacles. For a centralized WPAN controlled by an access point, it is shown that multihop communication, with the introduction of a small number of relay nodes, is effective in maintaining network connectivity in scenarios where single-hop communication would suffer unacceptable outages. The proposed multihop MAC protocol accounts for the fact that every link in the WPAN is highly directional, and is shown, using packet level simulations, to maintain high network utilization with low overhead.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5262284/05262296.pdf","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5262284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blockage and directivity in 60 GHz wireless personal area networks: from cross-layer model to multihop MAC design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5262296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","displayDocTitle":"Blockage and directivity in 60 GHz wireless personal area networks: from cross-layer model to multihop MAC design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262296/","publicationDate":"October 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10893438","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5262296/","volume":"27","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blockage and directivity in 60 GHz wireless personal area networks: from cross-layer model to multihop MAC design","sourcePdf":"1400jsac0809sum.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098351S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5262284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"5262284","articleId":"5262296","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5262298,"authors":[{"name":"Seokhyun Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dankook University, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5262284/5262298/5262298-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seokhyun Yoon (SM'95-M'03) received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Sung Kyun Kwan University, Suwon, Korea, in 1992 and 1996, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, in 2003.","In 1999, he was with the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Deajeon, Korea.

The upcoming mmWave WPAN is based on dynamic time division multiple access (TDMA) and designed to guarantee Gbps-order transmission capability for high definition TV (HDTV) transmission, high speed wireless docking and gaming, etc. The decode-and-forward (DF) type of relay offers a simple solution to the issues of mmWave WPAN systems, such as limited coverage range and unexpected blockage. However, due to the required extra time, DF relay on the other hand decreases the effective throughput, and may not be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the above data-rate-greedy applications. Inspired by the fact that the significant path loss of a millimeter-wave environment can provide good space isolation, we propose a deflection routing scheme to improve the effective throughput by sharing time slots for direct path with relay path. Based on the sub-exhaustive search, a routing algorithm, named as best fit deflection routing (BFDR), has been developed to find the relay path with the least interference that maximizes the system throughput. To reduce the computational complexity of the BFDR, we have also developed a sub-optimal algorithm named as random fit deflection routing (RFDR). The RFDR algorithm finds the sub-optimized relay path, where the interference may not be the least but is sufficiently low to guarantee the concurrent transmissions. Computer simulations show that, in realistic 60 GHz environments, the effective system throughput can be improved up to 28% under grid topology and 35% under random topology. RFDR achieves almost the same order of throughput improvement with only 10% of the computational complexity of BFDR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5262301/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"October 2009","accessionNumber":"10893449","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Relay with deflection routing for effective throughput improvement in Gbps millimeter-wave WPAN systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay with deflection routing for effective throughput improvement in Gbps millimeter-wave WPAN systems","sourcePdf":"1453jsac0809lan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09814S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5262284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5262284","articleId":"5262301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5262302,"authors":[{"name":"Shuzo Kato","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communications, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan","National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5262284/5262302/5262302-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuzo Kato received his Ph.

The measurement setup with highly directional mechanically steerable antennas and 800 MHz bandwidth was developed and experiments were performed for conference room and cubicle environments. Measurement results demonstrate that the 60 GHz propagation channel is quasioptical in nature and received signal power is obtained through line of sight (LOS) and reflected signal paths of the first and second orders. The 60 GHz WLAN system prototype using steerable directional antennas with 18 dB gain was able to achieve about 30 dB baseband SNR for LOS transmission, about 15-20 dB for communications through the first-order reflected path, and 2-6 dB SNR when using second-order reflection for the office environments. The intra cluster statistical parameters of the propagation channel were evaluated and a statistical model for reflected clusters is proposed. Experimental results demonstrating strong polarization impact on the characteristics of the propagation channel are presented. Cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) of the propagation channel was estimated as approximately 20 dB for LOS transmission and 10-20 dB for NLOS reflected paths.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091018","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5262284/05262304.pdf","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5262284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental investigations of 60 GHz WLAN systems in office environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Experimental investigations of 60 GHz WLAN systems in office environment","volume":"27","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10893444","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5262304/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262304/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental investigations of 60 GHz WLAN systems in office environment","sourcePdf":"1488jsac0809maltsev.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053511S","chronDate":"October  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5262284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"5262284","articleId":"5262304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5262468,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The primary intent is to protect the electrical interconnection from a widespread collapse. Wide area controls are meant to protect the grid as an entity. In some cases, the appropriate action would be islanding and blacking out a portion of the grid in order to prevent widespread collapse. New wide area systems will enable rapid diagnosis and provide solutions to specific grid disruptions or outages. A successful intelligent grid control implementation will require careful coordination between wide-area and local control schemes. Since many of the control actions will need to be decided and executed quickly, the tools need to be reliable, prompt and correct. They need to have secure backup schemes to ensure reliability. Secure, reliable communication has been identified as the primary challenge to deploying automated, prompt self-healing wide-area grid control actions. Another implementation challenge remains, the complexity, architecture, location and costs of such type of wide area systems.","doi":"10.1109/PSAMP.2009.5262468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSAMP.2009.5262468","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Power Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234368/5262321/05262468.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Power Systems Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5262321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phasor measurement units: Functionality and applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Phasor measurement units: Functionality and applications","conferenceDate":"10-13 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5262468/","accessionNumber":"10892432","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262468/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phasor measurement units: Functionality and applications","confLoc":"Clemson, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"004TP14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048312S","chronDate":"10-13 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234368","isNumber":"5262321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234368","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5262321","articleId":"5262468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5262591,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Sun","affiliation":["College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37984424000"},{"name":"Weiguo Zhang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Weiguo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37597062100"},{"name":"Meng Zhang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37539171200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4794-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4795-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"5262591","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5262591","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Cloning","Entropy","Aircraft","Genetic mutations","Automation","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Aerospace control","Logistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","convergence","encoding","entropy","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified particle swarm optimization","immune clone principle","analog-matching","low order equivalent system","aircraft","high order system","velocity-displacement operator","antibodies","clone selection","clone suppression","high-frequency mutation","real coding","convergence speed","entropy maximization","flight control system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","immunity clone","entropy maximization","analog-matching"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2009.5262591","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234371/5262555/05262591.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","startPage":"1135","endPage":"1138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5262555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2009.5262591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified particle swarm optimization based on immune clone principle for analog-matching of equivalent system","abstract":"Low order equivalent system of aircraft can be calculated and evaluated flying qualities of high order system. A modified particle swarm optimization based on immune clone principle is proposed aiming at analog-matching of equivalent system. Through a comprehensive analysis of PSO algorithm, immunity clone algorithm was introduced to the PSO algorithm based on traditional velocity-displacement operator. The antibodies were regard as particles, and the clone selection, clone suppression and high-frequency mutation based on real coding were performed according to the degree of affinity, which enhanced convergence speed and precision of the algorithm. In the meantime, the initialization based on entropy maximization was adopted to improve the diversity of initialized particle swarm. The results show that the advanced algorithm can converge to the global optimum at a great rate with non-impact of initial value, and has important significance in online evaluation of aircraft flying qualities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262591/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10892818","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5262591/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modified particle swarm optimization based on immune clone principle for analog-matching of equivalent system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified particle swarm optimization based on immune clone principle for analog-matching of equivalent system","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"0216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071628S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234371","isNumber":"5262555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234371","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5262555","articleId":"5262591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5262604,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Xuan","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Xuan","id":"37647345700"},{"name":"Zhang Minglu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Minglu","id":"37271527000"},{"name":"Liu Wei","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Wei","id":"37651474500"},{"name":"Fan Lina","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Lina","id":"38105553000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4794-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4795-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"5262604","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Process design","Robotics and automation","Robotic assembly","Matrix decomposition","Fires","Product design","Design automation","Logistics","Mechanical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design objective","axiomatic design","design matrix","design parameters","modular robot system configuration design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Axiomatic design","Modular robot","Special robot","Design matrix"]}],"abstract":"Axiomatic Design is applied to the modular special robot configuration system.

adaptive beamforming under quadratic constraint in the presence of mismatches","abstract":"The performances of the conventional adaptive beamforming algorithms degrade severely in the presence of even slight mismatches between the actual and presumed array responses to the desired signal. Similar types of degradation can occur when the signal array response is known exactly, but the training sample size is small. In this paper, based on explicit modeling of uncertainties in the desired signal array response and data covariance matrix, we propose robust adaptive beamforming algorithm under a quadratic inequality constraint with gradient-descent method. It is shown that the proposed algorithm belongs to the class of diagonal loading approaches, but the diagonal loading term can be precisely calculated based on the given level of uncertainties in the signal array response and data covariance matrix. Our proposed robust adaptive beamforming algorithm provides a significantly improved robustness against the signal steering vector mismatches and small training sample size, has a low complexity cost and makes the mean output array SINR consistently close to the optimal one. Computer simulation results demonstrate substantial performance improvement of our proposed algorithm as compared with the conventional adaptive beamforming algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262660/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10892552","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5262660/","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming under quadratic constraint in the presence of mismatches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive beamforming under quadratic constraint in the presence of mismatches","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"0230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066371S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234371","isNumber":"5262555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234371","xplore-issue":"5262555","articleId":"5262660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5262667,"authors":[{"name":"Dongmei Yan","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Dongmei","lastName":"Yan","id":"37399585100"},{"name":"JinKuan Wang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"JinKuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280537400"},{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539371200"},{"name":"Bin Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, ShenYang, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406445200"},{"name":"Peng Xu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, ShenYang, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37395509000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4794-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4795-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"5262667","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"abstract":"One of the most important constraints on wireless sensor network is the low power consumption. Therefore, topology of wireless sensor network must focus on power conservation. It is possible to extend the lifetime of a network by controlling its topology through clustering. Overlapping clustering find its wide applications such as inter-cluster routing, topology discovery, node localization, and recovery from cluster head failure and so on. Topology control target tracking-oriented based on overlapping clustering in wireless sensor network is proposed in this paper. When a target move to the sensing filed, cluster heads is located by fuzzy clustering, and then these cluster heads invite their neighboring sensors to form a cluster. The trajectory of targets is estimated by maximum entropy clustering. Utilizing cluster technology can make good use of each sensor nodes' limited energy and perform tasks coordinately.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Wireless sensor networks","Signal processing algorithms","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Network topology","Signal processing","Power engineering and energy","Trajectory","Intelligent sensors","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption","target tracking","telecommunication network topology","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["topology control target tracking","overlapping clustering","wireless sensor network","low power consumption","power conservation","inter-cluster routing","topology discovery","node localization","cluster heads","fuzzy clustering","maximum entropy clustering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Topology Control","Collaborative Signal Processing","Wireless Sensor Network","overlapping clustering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2009.5262667","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234371/5262555/05262667.pdf","startPage":"1756","endPage":"1759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5262555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2009.5262667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology control target tracking-oriented based on overlapping clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5262667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Topology control target tracking-oriented based on overlapping clustering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262667/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5262667/","accessionNumber":"10892559","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology control target tracking-oriented based on overlapping clustering","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"0342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042571S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234371","isNumber":"5262555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234371","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5262555","articleId":"5262667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5262672,"authors":[{"name":"Jingwen Tian","affiliation":["College of Automation, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingwen","lastName":"Tian","id":"37290884900"},{"name":"Meijuan Gao","affiliation":["College of Automation, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meijuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289044200"},{"name":"Yang Sun","affiliation":["College of Automation, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37897855800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4794-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4795-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"5262672","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Data mining","Neural networks","Automation","Information technology","Databases","Fuzzy systems","Pattern recognition","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","data mining","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear functions","optimisation","pattern classification","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web text information classification mining","fuzzy neural network training","Internet","information technology","document classification","Levenberg-Marquart optimizing algorithm","convergence","self-learning approach","nonlinear function approach","pattern classification","fuzzy set theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web mining","classification","fuzzy neural network","Levenberg-Marquart algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5262672","abstract":"With the development and widely used of Internet and information technology, the Web has become one of the most important means to obtain information for people.

The behavior of soft tissue can be described by a mass-spring model provided that correct parameters, such as spring stiffness and viscosity, are used. In practice, such parameters are often determined by trial-and-error based on the visual effects of simulation. Therefore, it is very difficult to obtain accurate values, and the process is tedious and time consuming. In this paper, a heuristic optimization technique is proposed to identify these parameters of the mass-spring model for soft tissue simulation. We employ the simulated annealing algorithm to tune the parameters automatically until the deformation of simulated soft tissue approximates the reference one as defined by a new modified tensor-mass model in which we have taken into account the viscoelasticity of soft tissue. The proposed technique provides an automatic method to determine the parameters in mass-spring-based models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262704/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10892596","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5262704/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simulation of soft tissue using mass-spring model with simulated annealing optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of soft tissue using mass-spring model with simulated annealing optimization","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"0299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057396S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234371","isNumber":"5262555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234371","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5262555","articleId":"5262704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5262728,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Song","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai, Shandong Province, China","School of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Song","id":"37671175500"},{"name":"Yang Gang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai, Shandong Province, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Gang","id":"37061403700"},{"name":"Qu Zhi-Jian","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering Technology, Academy of Navy Equipment, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qu","lastName":"Zhi-Jian","id":"37087202671"},{"name":"Shi Shuang-shuang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Shuang-shuang","id":"38276122300"},{"name":"Chen Chao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chao","id":"38323540000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4794-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4795-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"5262728","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":866},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Stators","Parameter estimation","Permanent magnet motors","Synchronous motors","Machine vector control","Mathematical model","Equations","Filters","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","Kalman filters","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","parameter estimation","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PMSM","EKF","Elman neural network","permanent magnet synchronous motor","parameter identification","double closed-loop vector control system","modified extended Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PMSM","parameter identification","EKF","Elman NN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5262728","abstract":"Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is a complex plant to control, due to its high nonlinearity and strong coupling.

CCDEPSO is a two-population co-evolutionary algorithm, in which the individuals of one population are evolved according to differential evolution algorithm (DE) and the other individuals are evolved according to particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). In order to realize co-evolving of the two sub-populations, an information sharing scheme by sharing the fitness value and the corresponding position value of the two sub-populations is introduced. Furthermore, in order to improve the searching speed and avoid the results trapping in local optima prematurely, chaotic initialization and chaotic perturbation based on Tent map are introduced in CCDEPSO. The comparative testing experiments are performed by means of CCDEPSO, DE, CPSO and PSO algorithms on six benchmark functions. Experimental results demonstrate that the global optimization ability of CCDEPSO is better than other algorithms above mentioned.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2009.5262798","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234371/5262555/05262798.pdf","startPage":"885","endPage":"889","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2009.5262798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5262555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaotic co-evolutionary algorithm based on differential evolution and particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Chaotic co-evolutionary algorithm based on differential evolution and particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10892688","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5262798/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic co-evolutionary algorithm based on differential evolution and particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"0168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058247S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234371","isNumber":"5262555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234371","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5262555","articleId":"5262798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5262805,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Hu Zhiyong","affiliation":["Research Center Intelligent Sensing, Shenzhen Institute of Advance Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Chao Hu","lastName":"Zhiyong","id":"38258565400"},{"name":"Liu Yingzi Pan","affiliation":["Research Center Intelligent Sensing, Shenzhen Institute of Advance Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Liu Yingzi","lastName":"Pan","id":"38254783200"},{"name":"Zhenxing Zeng","affiliation":["Research Center Intelligent Sensing, Shenzhen Institute of Advance Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhenxing","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37069084700"},{"name":"Max Q.-H.

Fixed speed wind generators suffer greatly from meeting the requirements of new wind farm grid code, because they are largely dependent on reactive power. Integration of flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) devices is a solution to overcome that problem, though it definitely increases the overall cost. Therefore, in this paper, we focuses on a new wind farm topology, where series or parallel connected fixed speed WTGSs are installed with variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driven permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG). VSWT-PMSG uses a fully controlled frequency converter for grid interfacing and it has abilities to control its reactive power as well as to provide maximum power to the grid. Suitable control strategy is developed in this paper for the multilevel frequency converter of VSWT-PMSG. A real grid code defined in the power system is considered to analyze the low voltage ride through (LVRT) characteristic of both fixed and variable speed WTGSs. Moreover, dynamic performance of the system is also evaluated using real wind speed data. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed topology can be a cost effective solution to augment the LVRT requirement as well as to minimize voltage fluctuation of both fixed and variable speed WTGSs.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2030421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5395745/05262959.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2030421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Variable Speed Wind Turbine Control Strategy to Meet Wind Farm Grid Code Requirements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5262959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262959/","displayDocTitle":"A Variable Speed Wind Turbine Control Strategy to Meet Wind Farm Grid Code Requirements","volume":"25","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11087712","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5262959/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Variable Speed Wind Turbine Control Strategy to Meet Wind Farm Grid Code Requirements","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-muyeen-2030421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187821S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5395745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"270","xplore-issue":"5395745","articleId":"5262959","onlineDate":"25 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5262970,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Han","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Han","id":"37686555500"},{"name":"Wen-Fang Xie","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wen-Fang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37288309000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4794-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4795-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"5262970","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Neural networks","Sliding mode control","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Uncertainty","Lyapunov method","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control nonlinearities","control system analysis","control system synthesis","identification","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","position control","singularly perturbed systems","uncertain systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear system","Lyapunov function analysis","singularly perturbed technique","sliding mode methodology","trajectory tracking","modeling error","modeling disturbance","online identification algorithm","dynamic neural network","multitime scale","uncertain system","control nonlinearities","adaptive control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5262970","abstract":"An on-line identification algorithm via dynamic neural networks with different time-scales followed by controller design is proposed for the dynamic systems with nonlinearity and uncertainty in this paper.

Although these two problems share many aspects in common, they are traditionally treated separately. In this paper, we present a unified framework to jointly solve time synchronization and localization problems at the same time. Furthermore, since the accuracy of synchronization and localization is very sensitive to the accuracy of anchor timings and locations, the joint time synchronization and localization problem with inaccurate anchors is also considered in this paper. For the case with accurate anchors, the joint maximum likelihood estimator and a more computationally efficient least squares (LS) estimator are proposed. When the anchor timings and locations are inaccurate, a generalized total least squares (GTLS) scheme is proposed. Crame\u00bfr-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) and the analytical mean square error (MSE) expressions of the LS based estimators are derived for both accurate and inaccurate anchor cases. Results show that the proposed joint estimators exhibit performances close to their respective CRLBs and outperform the separate time synchronization and localization approach.

The spectral decomposition of the circulant channel matrix through the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) allows the use of superfast algorithms for both the design of zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalizers, and the equalization of received signals.

It is unreasonable to measure the dissimilarity between two BIFs based on their Euclidean distance. This is because BIFs are extrinsically very high dimensional and intrinsically low dimensional, i.e., BIFs are sampled from a low-dimensional manifold and embedded in a high-dimensional space. Therefore, it is essential to find the intrinsic structure of a set of BIFs, obtain a suitable mapping to implement the dimensionality reduction, and measure the dissimilarity between two BIFs in the low-dimensional space based on their Euclidean distance. In this paper, we study the manifold constructed by a set of BIFs utilized for scene classification, form a new dimensionality reduction algorithm by preserving both the geometry of intra BIFs and the discriminative information inter BIFs termed Discriminative and Geometry Preserving Projections (DGPP), and construct a new framework for scene classification. In this framework, we represent an image based on a new BIF, which combines the intensity channel, the color channel, and the C1 unit of a color image; then we project the high-dimensional BIF to a low-dimensional space based on DGPP; and, finally, we conduct the classification based on the multiclass support vector machine (SVM). Thorough empirical studies based on the USC scene dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the classification rates around 100% relatively and the training speed 60 times for different sites in comparing with previous gist proposed by Siagian and Itti in 2007.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2032939","startPage":"174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5353839/05262997.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2032939","endPage":"184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biologically Inspired Feature Manifold for Scene Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262997/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Biologically Inspired Feature Manifold for Scene Classification","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5262997/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11020088","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","pubMedId":"19783505","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biologically Inspired Feature Manifold for Scene Classification","sourcePdf":"19tip01-dtao-2032939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104392S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5353839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"5353839","articleId":"5262997","onlineDate":"25 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5262999,"authors":[{"name":"Qian He","affiliation":["EE Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"He","id":"37308640100"},{"name":"Rick S.

Coherent processing requires phase synchronization. Usually, perfect phase synchronization is difficult to realize. Assuming frequency synchronization, possibly through reception of a beacon, and white noise, possibly due to estimating the covariance matrix and whitening the observations, we consider the impact of static phase errors at the transmitters and receivers for cases with sufficiently high SNR such that the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) provides accurate performance estimates. We model the phase errors as random variables and discuss the impact of these errors on target localization performance. In a few example cases the CRB is computed and compared with those in the ideal coherent and noncoherent processing cases. For these examples, using numerical results, we will show that at high enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), phase errors degrade performance only by a relatively small amount.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cramer\u2013Rao Bound for MIMO Radar Target Localization With Phase Errors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2032994","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5263912/05262999.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2032994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5263912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5262999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5262999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Cramer\u2013Rao Bound for MIMO Radar Target Localization With Phase Errors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5262999/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"10991986","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cramer\u2013Rao Bound for MIMO Radar Target Localization With Phase Errors","sourcePdf":"17lsp01-qhe-2032994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063745S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5263912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5263912","articleId":"5262999","onlineDate":"25 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5263002,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio De Maio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Biomedica, Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli \u201cFederico II\u201d, Napoli, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5379139/5263002/5263002-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio De Maio (S'01\u2013AM'02\u2013M'03\u2013SM'07) was born in Sorrento, Italy, on June 20, 1974.

At the design stage, we devise a code design algorithm complying with the following optimality criterion: maximization of the detection performance under a control on the regions of achievable values for the temporal and spatial Doppler estimation accuracy, and on the degree of similarity with a pre-fixed radar code. The resulting quadratic optimization problem is solved resorting to a convex relaxation that belongs to the semidefinite program (SDP) class. An optimal solution of the initial problem is then constructed through a suitable rank-one decomposition of an optimal solution of the relaxed one. At the analysis stage, we assess the performance of the new algorithm both on simulated data and on the standard challenging the Knowledge-Aided Sensor Signal Processing and Expert Reasoning (KASSPER) datacube.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2032993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05263002.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2032993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","startPage":"679","endPage":"694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code Design for Radar STAP via Optimization Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5263002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Code Design for Radar STAP via Optimization Theory","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5263002/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054905","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5263002/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code Design for Radar STAP via Optimization Theory","sourcePdf":"tsp-palomar-2032993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112573S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5263002","onlineDate":"25 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5263006,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Buzzi","affiliation":["DAEIMI, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Buzzi","id":"37268082600"},{"name":"Luca Venturino","affiliation":["DAEIMI, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Venturino","id":"37284300600"},{"name":"Alessio Zappone","affiliation":["DAEIMI, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Zappone","id":"37399768400"},{"name":"Antonio De Maio","affiliation":["DIET, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"De Maio","id":"37272858900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5263006","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this work, we consider the problem of detecting the presence of a new user in a direct-sequence/code-division-multiple-access (DS/CDMA) system with a doubly dispersive fading channel, and we propose a novel blind detection strategy that only requires knowledge of the spreading code of the user to be detected, but no prior information as to the time-varying channel impulse response and the structure of the multiaccess interference.

Remapping of the model is shown to allow improved modeling capabilities and accurate estimates of dynamic circuit parameters when used with subspace parameter-estimation techniques. The performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by application to batteries for an all-electric personal rapid transit vehicle from the urban light transport (ULTRA) program, which is designated for use at Heathrow Airport, U.K. The advantages of the proposed model over the Randles' circuit are demonstrated by comparisons with alternative observer/estimator techniques, such as the basic Utkin observer and the Kalman estimator. These techniques correctly identify and converge on voltages associated with the battery state-of-charge (SoC), despite erroneous initial conditions, thereby overcoming problems attributed to SoC drift (incurred by Coulomb-counting methods due to overcharging or ambient temperature fluctuations). Observation of these voltages, as well as online monitoring of the degradation of the estimated dynamic model parameters, allows battery aging (state-of-health) to also be assessed and, thereby, cell failure to be predicted. Due to the adaptive nature of the proposed algorithms, the techniques are suitable for applications over a wide range of operating environments, including large ambient temperature variations. Moreover, alternative battery topologies may also be accommodated by the automatic adjustment of the underlying state-space models used in both the parameter-estimation and observer/estimator stages.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2028348","startPage":"3905","endPage":"3916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2028348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/05263028.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Battery Model and State-of-Health Determination Through Subspace Parameter Estimation and State-Observer Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5263028/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Battery Model and State-of-Health Determination Through Subspace Parameter Estimation and State-Observer Techniques","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5263028/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10903088","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Battery Model and State-of-Health Determination Through Subspace Parameter Estimation and State-Observer Techniques","sourcePdf":"tvt-gould-2028348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063623S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"5263028","onlineDate":"25 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5263033,"authors":[{"name":"Thanh Mung Lam","affiliation":["Technische Universiteit Delft, Delft, Zuid-Holland, NL"],"firstName":"Thanh Mung","lastName":"Lam","id":"37413798900"},{"name":"Harmen Wigert Boschloo","affiliation":["Aerospace Software and Technologies Institute, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Harmen Wigert","lastName":"Boschloo","id":"37418925000"},{"name":"Max Mulder","affiliation":["Control and Simulation Division, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Max","lastName":"Mulder","id":"37408700200"},{"name":"Marinus M. van Paassen","affiliation":["Control and Simulation Division, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Marinus M.","lastName":"van Paassen","id":"37394673500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4427"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2426"}],"articleNumber":"5263033","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":115,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1628},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5263033","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force feedback","Haptic interfaces","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Collision avoidance","Force control","Force sensors","Vehicle driving","Impedance","Shape","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","aerospace robotics","collision avoidance","feedback","haptic interfaces","remotely operated vehicles","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial force field","haptic feedback","UAV teleoperation","collision avoidance","repulsive forces","control inceptor","control deflections","uninhabited aerial vehicle","operator control demand"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial force field (AFF)","collision avoidance","haptic feedback","teleoperation","uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2028239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5281203/05263033.pdf","startPage":"1316","endPage":"1330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2028239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5281203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Force Field for Haptic Feedback in UAV Teleoperation","abstract":"The feedback upon which operators in teleoperation tasks base their control actions differs substantially from the feedback to the driver of a vehicle. On the one hand, there is often a lack of sensory information; on the other hand, there is additional status information presented via the visual channel. Haptic feedback could be used to unload the visual channel and to compensate for the lack of feedback in other modalities. For collision avoidance, haptic feedback could provide repulsive forces via the control inceptor. Haptic feedback allows operators to interpret the repulsive forces as impedance to their control deflections when a potential for collision exists. Haptic information can be generated from an artificial force field (AFF) that maps environment constraints to repulsive forces. This paper describes the design and theoretical evaluation of a novel AFF, i.e., the parametric risk field, for teleoperation of an uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV). The field allows adjustments of the size, shape, and force gradient by means of parameter settings, which determine the sensitivity of the field. Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the field for collision avoidance for various parameter settings. Results indicate that the novel AFF more effectively performs the collision avoidance function than potential fields known from literature. Because of its smaller size, the field yields lower repulsive forces, results in less force cancellation effects, and allows for larger UAV velocities. This indicates less operator control demand and more effective UAV operations, both expected to lead to lower operator workload, while, at the same time, increasing safety.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5263033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","volume":"39","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10919107","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Force Field for Haptic Feedback in UAV Teleoperation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Force Field for Haptic Feedback in UAV Teleoperation","sourcePdf":"tsmca-mulder-2028239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055742S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","isNumber":"5281203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"115","articleId":"5263033","onlineDate":"25 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5263037,"authors":[{"name":"David Issadore","affiliation":["Center of Systems Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA","School of Engineering of Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5338501/5263037/5263037-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Issadore received the B.S. degree in physics and in electrical engineering from Pennsylvania State University, University Park, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in applied physics from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, in 2009.

The double-pass fiber amplifier further reduces the out-band ASE by about 20 dB with a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) at the end of the fiber amplifier. In preliminary experiments with a 100 GHz bandpass filter, no degradation is observed from the optically preamplified coherent detection compared to pure coherent detection. With a 10 ns pulse width, 500 kHz repetition rate, and 10 pW average input power, about 2 dB and 1 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements are achieved when 5% and 50% time gating duty cycles are used, respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5233095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2009.2024773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/5233095/05265236.pdf","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1296","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2009.2024773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing ASE Effect in Coherent Detection by Employing Double-Pass Fiber Preamplifier and Time-Domain Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Reducing ASE Effect in Coherent Detection by Employing Double-Pass Fiber Preamplifier and Time-Domain Filter","volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5265236/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10902824","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5265236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing ASE Effect in Coherent Detection by Employing Double-Pass Fiber Preamplifier and Time-Domain Filter","sourcePdf":"jqe-ychen-2024773.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059788S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"5233095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","xplore-issue":"5233095","articleId":"5265236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5267037,"authors":[{"name":"Yintat Ma","affiliation":["Integrated Nanosystems Research Facility Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yintat","lastName":"Ma","id":"37274225000"},{"name":"G.

In this way the processors adapt the hardware which is the most suitable solution for the running application and hence it accelerates the performance gain. The reconfigurable instruction set processors are programmable processors that contain the reconfigurable logic in one or more of their functional units. Among the most important design parameters are: the granularity of the reconfigurable logic, the structure of the configuration memory, the instructions encoding formats and the types of instructions supported. In this research paper a reconfigurable instruction set processor design has been introduced by using the tightly coupled reconfigurable cores. The proposed design is capable of loading partial configurations at run-time without disturbing the execution of running application. The proposed processor supports the demand driven modification of its instruction set. Implemented with partially reconfigurable field programmable gate array cores like those provided by Xilinx corporation, the processor treats the instructions as removable modules that are paged in and paged out through the partial reconfiguration as is demanded by the running application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RISP design using tightly coupled reconfigurable FPGA cores","doi":"10.1109/ICICT.2009.5267182","startPage":"249","endPage":"254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICT.2009.5267182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5267172","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235874/5267172/05267182.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5267182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5267182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"RISP design using tightly coupled reconfigurable FPGA cores","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5267182/","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10892958","conferenceDate":"15-16 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RISP design using tightly coupled reconfigurable FPGA cores","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"Paper37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045529S","chronDate":"15-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235874","isNumber":"5267172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235874","xplore-issue":"5267172","articleId":"5267182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5267197,"authors":[{"name":"Mazdak Zamani","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Systems, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mazdak","lastName":"Zamani","id":"37408743700"},{"name":"Hamed Taherdoost","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Systems, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Taherdoost","id":"37395415000"},{"name":"Azizah A.

The motivation of choosing image as a cover is driven by the fact that human visual system is less sensitive than human auditory system thus an image provides better masking effect. The algorithm is based on decomposition of images using Daubechies wavelet basis. The technique proposed in this paper resolves the problem of severe distortion caused by watermarking audio in an image by developing a scaling function that achieves maximum robustness and transparency prior to its embedding. The property of texture is used as a criterion to identify the target area for embedding the watermark. The security of the algorithm is enhanced by performing a random permutation of the watermark. The hidden data can be recovered reliably under certain attacks such as global tampering, localized tampering and contrast enhancement.","doi":"10.1109/CCCM.2009.5267473","publicationTitle":"2009 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234326/5267449/05267473.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCCM.2009.5267473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5267449","startPage":"478","endPage":"481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy based audio watermarking in image using wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5267473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Entropy based audio watermarking in image using wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5267473/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893388","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5267473/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy based audio watermarking in image using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053536S","chronDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234326","isNumber":"5267449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234326","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5267449","articleId":"5267473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5267479,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Liuyang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Liuyang","id":"38110771900"},{"name":"Shi Yuwen","affiliation":["College of Sciences, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Yuwen","id":"38104792400"},{"name":"Tang Pengcheng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tang","lastName":"Pengcheng","id":"38110772800"},{"name":"Zhang Hui","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Hui","id":"38104840500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4247-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-9613"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-963X"}],"articleNumber":"5267479","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5267479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fault diagnosis modeling method combined RBF neural network with rough set theory","abstract":"In order to improve diagnosis precision and decreasing misinformation diagnosis, according to the intelligence complementary strategy, a new complex intelligent fault diagnosis method based on rough sets theory and RBF neural network is presented.

However, PSO easily suffers from local minima when dealing with complex problems. In order to enhance the standard PSO, this paper presents an improved PSO algorithm, namely PMPSO, which employs a power mutation (PM). The main idea of PMPSO is to conduct a PM on the global best particle in current swarm. It is to hope that the mutation could help particles jump out local optima. To verify the performance of the proposed approach, PMPSO is compared with some existing algorithms, PSO with Cauchy mutation (HPSO), PSO with near neighbor interactions algorithm (FDR-PSO), classical evolutionary programming (CEP), and fast evolutionary programming (FEP) on ten well-known benchmark functions. Experimental results show that PMPSO achieves better results on majority of test functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5267559/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10893088","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5267559/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization based on power mutation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization based on power mutation","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046276S","chronDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234326","isNumber":"5267482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234326","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5267482","articleId":"5267559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5267584,"authors":[{"name":"Lan-Xun Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Lan-Xun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37900135600"},{"name":"Kang Yang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Yang","id":"38105410800"},{"name":"Bin Xu","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xu","id":"38105145800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4247-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-9613"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-963X"}],"articleNumber":"5267584","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"abstract":"This paper proposes a union algorithm of SLM and PTS to reduce PAPR in OFDM system.

The approach considers the decision essentials as optimization objectives rather than decision constraints, and overcomes the limitations of the traditional methods. Furthermore, a new decision method using multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on Pareto concepts is given. The initial experimental results have shown that our multi-objective planning approach can effectively produce more than one Pareto optimization solution compromising all decision essentials within one single running, and decision-makers can choose the solution they need among the alternatives.","doi":"10.1109/CCCM.2009.5267600","startPage":"392","endPage":"394","publicationTitle":"2009 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCCM.2009.5267600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5267482","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234326/5267482/05267600.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Urban planning decision using multi-objective optimization algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5267600/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Urban planning decision using multi-objective optimization algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5267600/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10893137","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","conferenceDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Urban planning decision using multi-objective optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044151S","chronDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234326","isNumber":"5267482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234326","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5267482","articleId":"5267600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5267806,"authors":[{"name":"Long Cheng-zhi","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China","School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Cheng-zhi","id":"38273254400"},{"name":"Chen Hui","affiliation":["School of Foreign Studies, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Hui","id":"38182102600"},{"name":"Li Li-hong","affiliation":["Software College, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li-hong","id":"38275988900"},{"name":"Wu Wei-ling","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Wei-ling","id":"38276034100"},{"name":"Xiang Man-tian","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Man-tian","id":"38277778500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4247-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-9613"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-963X"}],"articleNumber":"5267806","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Minimization methods","Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency","Computer networks","Resource management","Power engineering and energy","Energy consumption","Potential energy","Wireless application protocol","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy minimization algorithm","synergy choice","resource-constrained wireless senor network","cooperative diversity","energy consumption","cooperation synergy","resource-constrained wireless sensor network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative diversity","synergy choice","energy efficiency","resource-constrained wireless sensor networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5267806","abstract":"Cooperative diversity can be applied to energy-constrained resource-constrained wireless sensor network s to significantly reduce node energy consumption.

Such tasks are considered core tools for Decision Support Systems in a widespread urea, ranging from the industry, commerce, military and scientific fields. The data sources used here for experimental testing are commonly used and considered us a standard for rule discovery algorithms reliability ranking.

And also, there would be a part to present our design about some new strategies for the policy repository, that with the technology features of cognitive network for dynamic spectrum access, a cognitive network can detect the use of local channel and real-time status to respond automatically to avoid interrupts.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCCM.2009.5267950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5267449","startPage":"184","endPage":"187","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234326/5267449/05267950.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The research on policy-management-based dynamic spectrum access technology for cognitive network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5267950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5267950/","displayDocTitle":"The research on policy-management-based dynamic spectrum access technology for cognitive network","conferenceDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893380","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The research on policy-management-based dynamic spectrum access technology for cognitive network","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047656S","chronDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234326","isNumber":"5267449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234326","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5267449","articleId":"5267950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5267992,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Wehner","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wehner","id":"37390131500"},{"name":"Lenny Oliker","firstName":"Lenny","lastName":"Oliker","id":"38112056200"},{"name":"John Shalf","firstName":"John","lastName":"Shalf","id":"37281789600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9235"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9340"}],"articleNumber":"5267992","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":611},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Meteorology","Program processors","Supercomputers","Computational modeling","Clouds","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics computing","microprocessor chips","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computer","numerical weather forecasting","AMD Opteron","Tensilica XTensa LX2","Green Flash"]}],"abstract":"Attempts to calculate the weather numerically have a long history. The first effort along these lines took place not in some cutting-edge university or government lab but on what the lone man doing it described as \"a heap of hay in a cold rest billet.\" Lewis Fry Richardson, serving as an ambulance driver during World War I and working with little more than a table of logarithms, made a heroic effort to calculate weather changes across central Europe from first principles way back in 1917. The day he chose to simulate had no particular significance-other than that a crude set of weather-balloon measurements was available to use as a starting point for his many hand calculations. It's no surprise that the results didn't at all match reality. Three decades (and one world war) later, mathematician John von Neumann, a computer pioneer, returned to the problem of calculating the weather, this time with electronic assistance, although the limitations of the late-1940s computer he was using very much restricted his attempt to simulate nature. The phenomenal advances in computing power since von Neumann's time have, however, improved the accuracy of numerical weather forecasting and allowed it to become a routine part of daily life. Will it rain this afternoon? Ask the weatherman, who in turn will consult a computer calculation.","doi":"10.1109/MSPEC.2009.5267992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/5267875/05267992.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.2009.5267992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5267875","startPage":"24","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Real Cloud Computer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5267992","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Real Cloud Computer","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5267992/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880982","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5267992/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Real Cloud Computer","sourcePdf":"15-10LowPowerSupercomputer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04696S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6","isNumber":"5267875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5267875","articleId":"5267992","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5267999,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Bai","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Bai","id":"37288020900"},{"name":"Xueying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xueying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291969300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4247-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-9613"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-963X"}],"articleNumber":"5267999","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"abstract":"In the noisy environment, the performance of speech recognition system may become worse to some extent. In order to solve this problem, this paper used the zero-crossings with peak amplitudes (ZCPA) features as speech feature parameters, which are based on human hearings property. The extraction method of ZCPA features is that calculating the unward zero-crossing rate of speech signal gets frequency information, compressing amplitudes non-linearly incorporates intensity information, and form finally output features. This paper also used the support vector machine as recognition machine, realized a speech recognition system of non-specific person and isolated words with Visual C++ programming, and got the recognition results in different SNRs and in different words. Experiments indicate that the recognition correct rates based on ZCPA features and support vector machine are much higher than those of based on traditional hidden Markov model, and also have better

However, the computational complexity of ML detection algorithm grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas, which results in impractical to use in practice system. The use of QR decomposition with an M-algorithm (QRD-M) has been proposed to provide near ML performance and low complexity. The QRD-M algorithm reduces the complexity by selecting M candidates with the smallest accumulated metrics at each level of the tree search. The trade-off between performance and complexity can be adjusted by setting the parameter M which cannot provide more valuable tradeoff options with better performance to complexity ratio. A new detection scheme, jointing MLD with QRD-M detection algorithm, is proposed in the paper. After performing QR decomposition of the channel matrix, the MLD with length L is done, the accumulated metrics are calculated and sorted, which gives an ordered set, then QRD-M algorithm are used to search the left layers. The proposed algorithm provides better tradeoff options by selecting different parameters L and M and getting more near-ML performance with lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CCCM.2009.5268061","publicationTitle":"2009 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234326/5267831/05268061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCCM.2009.5268061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5267831","startPage":"291","endPage":"294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint maximum likelihood and QRD-M detection algorithm for MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5268061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint maximum likelihood and QRD-M detection algorithm for MIMO system","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5268061/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10902949","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5268061/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint maximum likelihood and QRD-M detection algorithm for MIMO system","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051329S","chronDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234326","isNumber":"5267831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234326","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5267831","articleId":"5268061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5268093,"authors":[{"name":"Lizhen Du","affiliation":["Department of Industry Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lizhen","lastName":"Du","id":"37572107600"},{"name":"Junjie Wu","affiliation":["Department of Industry Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Junjie","lastName":"Wu","id":"38106449200"},{"name":"Fei Hu","affiliation":["Department of Industry Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Hu","id":"38105638300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4247-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-9613"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-963X"}],"articleNumber":"5268093","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logistics","Design optimization","Supply chains","Recycling","Costs","Production facilities","Design engineering","Communication industry","Computer industry","Industrial control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","facility location","integer programming","nonlinear programming","recycling","supply chains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logistics network design","optimization theory","closed-loop supply chain logistics network","mixed integer nonlinear programming model","product recycle","product remanufacturing","differential evolution algorithm","facility location problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["closed-loop supply chain","supply chain model","logistics network design","MINLP"]}],"abstract":"Based on the optimization theory and product recycle and remanufacturing, a closed-loop supply chain logistics network is designed, and a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is constructed.

The response of the neuron has the hysteretic characteristics.

The neural network composed by the neurons adopts the chaos optimization as the learning algorithm, which makes the network possess the ability of escaping from the local minimized point in the training process.

However, when the number of cognitive user is very large, the bandwidth for reporting cognitive users' sensing results will be insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm to alleviate the bandwidth problem of reporting channel. Compared with conventional method, only the cognitive users with reliable information are allowed to report their sensing results. When no user is reliable, only the cognitive user with highest reputation will report its sensing result. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves better sensing performance and the average number of sensing bits decreases greatly under AWGN channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5268140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10893251","htmlLink":"/document/5268140/","conferenceDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037134S","chronDate":"8-9 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234326","isNumber":"5268010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234326","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5268010","articleId":"5268140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5268143,"authors":[{"name":"WenJie Tian","affiliation":["Automation Institute, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"WenJie","lastName":"Tian","id":"37306902300"},{"name":"Yue Tian","affiliation":["Finance Institute, Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Tian","id":"37669669600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4247-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-9613"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-963X"}],"articleNumber":"5268143","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5268143","abstract":"A new fuzzy identification approach using support vector regression (SVR) and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOA) is presented in this paper.

The GA-based approach is discussed in detail. Zero-crossing detection of one of the source voltages is sufficient, and the PLL may be removed. An ANN-based PI controller is added for faster buildup of the voltage across the capacitor. Faster control of the capacitor-voltage reduces the size of the capacitor and also improves the bandwidth of the controller. The proposed technique is simulated (in Simulink) and is also experimentally confirmed by developing a dSPACE1104-based prototype. With the availability of low-cost and high-speed processors, such computationally extensive methods are expected to be popular in the future.","doi":"10.1109/MIE.2009.933881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4154573/5268174/05268184.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIE.2009.933881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5268174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shunt compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5268184/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Shunt compensation","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10892974","htmlLink":"/document/5268184/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shunt compensation","sourcePdf":"10-03mie03-bhattacharya.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109346S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4154573","isNumber":"5268174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4154573","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5268174","articleId":"5268184","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5268207,"authors":[{"name":"Zhili Lin","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhili","lastName":"Lin","id":"37403764500"},{"name":"Pan Ou","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Ou","id":"37541320100"},{"name":"Yudong Jia","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yudong","lastName":"Jia","id":"37532718800"},{"name":"Chunxi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunxi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288987000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5268207","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"A highly accurate and numerically stable model of Lorentz dielectric dispersion for the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is presented. The coefficients of the proposed model are optimally derived based on the Maclaurin series expansion (MSE) method and it is shown that the model is much better than the other four reported models in implementing the Lorentz dielectric dispersion with error of relative permittivity several orders lower. The model's stability and performance are also analyzed when it is incorporated into the practical second- and fourth-order accurate FDTD algorithms for an exemplified Lorentz medium. Interestingly, we find that all the mentioned models show nearly the same performance in the second-order algorithm due to its large intrinsic numerical dispersion and the superiority of the proposed MSE model begins to be manifested in the higher-order, say, fourth-order FDTD algorithms as implied by the governing numerical dispersion equations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/5290386/05268207.pdf","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2009.2031818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2009.2031818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5268207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Highly Accurate FDTD Model for Simulating Lorentz Dielectric Dispersion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dielectrics","Permittivity","Piecewise linear approximation","Numerical models","Algorithm design and analysis","Dispersion","Stability analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lorentz dielectric dispersion","FDTD model","finite difference time domain method","Maclaurin series expansion","relative permittivity","second order algorithm","numerical dispersion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)","Lorentz dielectric dispersion","Maclaurin series expansion (MSE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5268207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Highly Accurate FDTD Model for Simulating Lorentz Dielectric Dispersion","volume":"21","issue":"22","htmlLink":"/document/5268207/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10950282","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Highly Accurate FDTD Model for Simulating Lorentz Dielectric Dispersion","sourcePdf":"lpt-lin-2031818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063758S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"5290386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5290386","articleId":"5268207","onlineDate":"25 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
