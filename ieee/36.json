It is an extension of the basic PARDES model developed by Opher Etzion in 1990 to support derivations and integrity constraints in databases. The model's invariant-based language, unlike other programming languages, can follow data-driven rules' semantic properties. Such rules are activated by modifications of data items in a database, and they play an important role in many applications that maintain complex relationships between data items or interdependencies between parts of the database. Applications include expert systems, real-time databases, simulations, and decision-support systems. The authors present requirements for choosing an adequate programming style that uses data-driven rules. These requirements are based on software-engineering criteria such as compatibility with a high-level language and verifiability of the rule language. The authors show that contemporary database programming styles fail to meet these requirements, and they present the invariant-based language as a viable solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.362632","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/8308/00362632.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"38","doi":"10.1109/2.362632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maintaining data-driven rules in databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Maintaining data-driven rules in databases","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4881873","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/362632/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maintaining data-driven rules in databases","sourcePdf":"00362632.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038679S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"8","articleId":"362632","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":362710,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

The uniqueness of the I-O mappings of some model structures is discussed. The uniqueness of I-O mappings of different models tells us in what conditions given model structures can be differentiated from one another. Parameter uniqueness of the I-O mapping of a given structural model is also discussed, which tells us in what conditions a given model's parameters can be uniquely estimated from I-O measurements. These methods are then generalized so that they can be used to study single-input multi-output (SIMO), multi-input single-output (MISO), as well as multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system models. Parameter estimation of the two-input single-output nonlinear system model, which was left unsolved previously, can now be obtained using the newly derived algorithms. Applications of SCPE methods for modeling visual cortical neurons, system fault detection, modeling and identification of communication networks, biological systems, and natural and artificial neural networks are also discussed. The feasibility of these methods is demonstrated using simulated examples. SCPE methods presented in this paper can be further developed to study more complicated block-structured models, and will therefore have future potential for modeling and identifying highly complex multi-input multi-output nonlinear systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/362753/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","volume":"83","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4856524","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and identification of parallel nonlinear systems: structural classification and parameter estimation methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and identification of parallel nonlinear systems: structural classification and parameter estimation methods","sourcePdf":"00362753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110622S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"70","articleId":"362753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":362754,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

The key in identifying trends is the understanding of the pivotal factors at any given stage of technology progression. One such parameter is the physical area of the processor. In coming technologies there will be opposite demands placed on the system's area stemming from a need to reduce the proportion of interconnection capacitance and to send signals across the processor. Contrary to the usual perception, delays resulting from wiring capacitance decrease if processor area increases, while the minimization of signal travel times favors reducing area. The system size tradeoff in the case of bipolar processors is primarily determined by power density, while CMOS processor sizes are determined by wirability requirements. To achieve the full potential of CMOS, interconnections will have to be carefully planned. The performance limits of bipolar and room temperature CMOS uniprocessors are shown to be very similar. The highest performance technology on the horizon is liquid nitrogen temperature CMOS. Alternate technologies, based on III-V compound devices, or more exotic quantum structures, are not expected to play a role in future general-purpose high-end systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/362754/","volume":"83","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4856523","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance trends in high-end processors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance trends in high-end processors","sourcePdf":"00362754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11807S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"163","articleId":"362754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":362755,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Jensen","affiliation":["The Electrical Engineering Departmen, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Jensen","id":"37279565900"},{"name":"Y.

This paper presents a thorough investigation of this antenna-tissue interaction using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic simulation approach with detailed models of real-life antennas on a transceiver handset. The monopole, side-mounted planar inverted F, top-mounted bent inverted F, and back-mounted planar inverted F antennas are selected as representative examples of external and internal configurations. Detailed models of the human head and hand are implemented to investigate the effects of the tissue location and physical model on the antenna performance. Experimental results are provided which support the computationally obtained conclusions. The specific absorption rate (SAR) in the tissue is examined for several different antenna/handset configurations. It is found that for a head-handset separation of 2 cm, the SAR in the head has a peak value between 0.9 and 3.8 mW/g and an average value between 0.06 and 0.10 mW/g for 1 W of power delivered to the antenna. Additionally, the head and hand absorb between 48 and 68% of the power delivered to the antenna.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EM interaction of handset antennas and a human in personal communications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.362755","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/8310/00362755.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.362755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=362755","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/362755/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"EM interaction of handset antennas and a human in personal communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"83","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4856522","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EM interaction of handset antennas and a human in personal communications","sourcePdf":"00362755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038645S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"335","articleId":"362755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":362777,"authors":[{"name":"W.R.

Instead, the magnitude exhibits a quasi-periodic oscillation which can be attributed to the interference of surface and space waves.

In general, the Burg method is used to estimate the prediction parameters. The Burg method leads to a stable prediction filter but can also cause bias in the estimated spectra. One can also use the modified covariance method (MCM) to estimate the prediction parameters. These parameters lead to unbiased spectra. However, the MCM does not guarantee a stable prediction filter. One may have to modify the prediction parameters to ensure a stable prediction filter. One way to ensure stability is to reflect the unstable poles inside the unit circle. It is shown that the modified parameters can be used effectively for data extrapolation. The radar images obtained using this extrapolated data are more accurate than those obtained using the extrapolated data from the Burg prediction parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8311/00362783.pdf","startPage":"1540","endPage":"1545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.362783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.362783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8311","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=362783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data extrapolation for high resolution radar imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Extrapolation","Image resolution","Radar imaging","Radar scattering","Filters","Parameter estimation","Fourier transforms","Bandwidth","Frequency estimation","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar imaging","image resolution","prediction theory","filtering theory","autoregressive processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high resolution radar imaging","AR modeling","scattered field data","Burg method","prediction parameters","stable prediction filter","modified covariance method","unbiased spectra","unstable poles","data extrapolation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/362783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Data extrapolation for high resolution radar imaging","volume":"42","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4854369","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data extrapolation for high resolution radar imaging","sourcePdf":"00362783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07552S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"8311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"44","articleId":"362783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":362787,"authors":[{"name":"F.

It consists of the finite element method (FEM) in combination with integral equation radiation conditions and a novel periodic boundary condition for 3-D FEM grids. Accurate modeling of rectangular, circular and circular-coaxial feeds is accomplished by enforcing continuity between the FEM solution and several waveguide modes across an aperture in the array's ground plane. The radiation condition above the array is enforced by a periodic integral equation in the form of a Floquet mode summation, thus reducing the solution to that of a single array unit cell. The periodic boundary condition at unit cell side walls is enforced through a matrix transformation. That mathematically \"folds\" opposing side walls onto each other with a phase shift appropriate to the array lattice and scan angle. The unit cell electric field is expanded in vector finite elements. Galerkin's method is used to cast the problem as a matrix equation, which is solved by the conjugate gradient method. A general-purpose computer code was developed and validated for cases of open-ended waveguides, microstrip patches, clad monopoles and printed flared notches, showing that the analysis method is accurate and versatile.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phased array antenna analysis with the hybrid finite element method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.362811","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8312/00362811.pdf","startPage":"1625","endPage":"1630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.362811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8312","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=362811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/362811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Phased array antenna analysis with the hybrid finite element method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4882577","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phased array antenna analysis with the hybrid finite element method","sourcePdf":"00362811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029765S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"8312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"78","articleId":"362811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":362836,"authors":[{"name":"Li Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Li Qiu","id":"37847129400"},{"name":"Tongwen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"lastName":"Tongwen Chen","id":"37087187367"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"362836","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"Treating causality constraints, this paper studies optimal synthesis of multirate sampled-data systems with an /spl Hscr//sub 2/ performance criteria.

These systems are controllable but not asymptotically stabilizable by a smooth static-state feedback control law. In addition, exponential stability cannot be obtained with a smooth, time-varying feedback control law. Here, global, asymptotical stability with exponential convergence is achieved about any desired configuration by using a nonsmooth, time-varying feedback control law. The control law depends, in addition to the state and time, on a function which is constant except at predefined instants of time where the function is recomputed as a nonsmooth function of the state. The inputs are differentiable with respect to time and tend exponentially toward zero. For use in the analysis, a lemma on the exponential convergence of a stable time-varying nonlinear system perturbed by an exponentially decaying signal is presented.

The author provides a theoretical justification for the fuzzy identifiers by proving that they are capable of following the output of a general nonlinear dynamic system to arbitrary accuracy in any finite time interval. The fuzzy identifiers are constructed from a set of adaptable fuzzy IF-THEN rules and can combine both numerical information (in the form of input-output pairs obtained by exciting the system with an input signal and measuring the corresponding outputs) and linguistic information (in the form of IF-THEN rules about the behavior of the system in terms of vague and fuzzy words) into their designs in a uniform fashion. The author develops two fuzzy identifiers. The first one is designed through the following four steps: 1) define some fuzzy sets in the state space U/spl sub/R/sup n/ of the system; these fuzzy sets do not change; 2) construct fuzzy rule bases of the fuzzy identifier which comprise rules whose IF parts constitute all the possible combinations of the fuzzy sets defined in 1); 3) design the fuzzy systems in the fuzzy identifier based on the fuzzy rule bases of 2); and 4) develop an adaptive law for the free parameters in the fuzzy identifier. The second fuzzy identifier is designed in a similar way as the first one except that: a) the parameters characterizing the fuzzy sets in the state space change during the adaptation procedure; and b) the fuzzy systems and the adaptive law are different. The author proves that: 1) both fuzzy identifiers are globally stable in the sense that all variables in the fuzzy identifiers are uniformly bounded, and 2) under some conditions the identification errors of both fuzzy identifiers converge to zero asymptotically. Finally, the author simulates the fuzzy identifiers for identifying the chaotic glycolytic oscillator, and the results show that: 1) the fuzzy identifiers can approximate the chaotic system at a reasonable speed and accuracy without using any linguistic information, and 2) by incorporating some fuzzy linguistic IF-THEN rules about the behavior of the system into the fuzzy identifiers, the speed and accuracy of the fuzzy identifiers are greatly improved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of fuzzy identifiers of nonlinear dynamic systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.362903","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/8314/00362903.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.362903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8314","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=362903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/362903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of fuzzy identifiers of nonlinear dynamic systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4871481","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of fuzzy identifiers of nonlinear dynamic systems","sourcePdf":"00362903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045955S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"174","articleId":"362903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":362914,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

To answer this question, a human sensorimotor control model, compatible with previous work by others, was assembled. This model incorporates linearized equations and full-state feedback with provision for state estimation. A form of gain-scheduling is employed to account for nonlinearities caused by control and biomechanical constraints. By decoupling the mechanics and transforming the controls into the space of experimentally observed strategies, the model is made amenable to the study of a number of possible control objectives. The objectives studied include cost functions on the state deviations, so as to control the center of mass, provide a stable platform for the head, or maintain upright stance, along with a cost function on control effort. Also studied was the effect of time delay on the stability of controls produced using various control strategies. An objective function weighting excursion of the center of mass and deviations from the upright stable position, while taking advantage of fast modes of the system, as dictated by inertial parameters and musculoskeletal geometry, produces a control that reasonably matches experimental data. Given estimates of sensor performance, the model is also suited for prediction of uncertainty in the response.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/362914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","volume":"42","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4860816","pubMedId":"7851935","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An optimal control model for analyzing human postural balance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimal control model for analyzing human postural balance","sourcePdf":"00362914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049234S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"341","articleId":"362914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":362919,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

The proposed controller structure comprises a form of intelligent feedforward control in the frame of decentralized control algorithm with feedback-error or driving torque error learning method. The another important features of these new algorithms are fast and robust convergence properties because the problem of adjusting the weights of internal hidden units is considered as a problem of estimating parameters by recursive least square method and Kalman filter approach.

The approach is demonstrated in detail for 2-port structures, with an outline of how it can readily be extended to the n-port case.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.362997","startPage":"143","endPage":"149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.362997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8318/00362997.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer microstrip structure analysis with matched load simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/362997/","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer microstrip structure analysis with matched load simulation","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4860785","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer microstrip structure analysis with matched load simulation","sourcePdf":"00362997.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053807S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"29","articleId":"362997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363006,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-Young Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hai-Young Lee","id":"37292580900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"363006","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1391},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"A typical grounded bonding wire with a minimum total length of 480 /spl mu/m for MMIC's and OEIC's is characterized using the method of moments with the incorporation of the ohmic loss as well as the radiation loss over a wide range of frequencies. The distributed ohmic resistance is calculated by an application of the Phenomenological Loss Equivalence Method. The simulated results show the wire resistance and the inductance increase greatly at frequencies above 30 GHz due to the high radiation effect enhanced by the slow-wave effect of the ohmic loss. The bonding wire is highly inductive in most of the frequency range and the maximum quality factor is mostly limited by the ohmic resistance. The results also show the simple static modeling of computer-aided design software that considers only the free-space wire inductance and the shin-effect resistance, overestimates the wire inductance at low frequencies, and is inappropriate at high frequencies due to the high radiation effect. This approach can be applied to many arbitrarily shaped interconnection wires for wideband design and characterization of high-frequency integrated circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Bonding","Wire","Frequency","Inductance","Radiation effects","Moment methods","Q factor","Design automation","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["method of moments","inductance","electric resistance","losses","Q-factor","skin effect","integrated circuit interconnections","MMIC","MIMIC","integrated circuit modelling","wires (electric)","integrated optoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband characterization","bonding wire","millimeter-wave integrated circuits","microwave ICs","MMIC","OEIC","moment method","ohmic loss","radiation loss","distributed ohmic resistance","phenomenological loss equivalence method","wire resistance","wire inductance","slow-wave effect","MM-wave ICs","MIMIC","480 micron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363006","doi":"10.1109/22.363006","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8318/00363006.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.363006","startPage":"63","endPage":"68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband characterization of a typical bonding wire for microwave and millimeter-wave integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wideband characterization of a typical bonding wire for microwave and millimeter-wave integrated circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4860776","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband characterization of a typical bonding wire for microwave and millimeter-wave integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00363006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044462S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"65","articleId":"363006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363095,"authors":[{"name":"A.F.

The authors show that efficient representations may be identified within a continuum of scale-space and used to enhance features of importance to mammography. Methods of contrast enhancement are described based on three overcomplete multiscale representations: 1) the dyadic wavelet transform (separable), 2) the /spl phi/-transform (nonseparable, nonorthogonal), and 3) the hexagonal wavelet transform (nonseparable). Multiscale edges identified within distinct levels of transform space provide local support for image enhancement. Mammograms are reconstructed from wavelet coefficients modified at one or more levels by local and global nonlinear operators. In each case, edges and gain parameters are identified adaptively by a measure of energy within each level of scale-space. The authors show quantitatively that transform coefficients, modified by adaptive nonlinear operators, can make more obvious unseen or barely seen features of mammography without requiring additional radiation. The authors' results are compared with traditional image enhancement techniques by measuring the local contrast of known mammographic features. They demonstrate that features extracted from multiresolution representations can provide an adaptive mechanism for accomplishing local contrast enhancement. By improving the visualization of breast pathology, one can improve chances of early detection while requiring less time to evaluate mammograms for most patients.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4853925","pubMedId":"18218551","volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mammographic feature enhancement by multiscale analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mammographic feature enhancement by multiscale analysis","sourcePdf":"00363095.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141926S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"8321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"259","articleId":"363095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":363096,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

More and more, the question asked by clinicians is how much and where, rather than a simple statement on the presence or absence of abnormalities. The authors present a study in which the results obtained with a semiautomatic, multispectral segmentation technique are quantitatively compared to manually delineated regions. The core of the semiautomatic image analysis system is a supervised artificial neural network classifier augmented with dedicated preand postprocessing algorithms, including anisotropic noise filtering and a surface-fitting method for the correction of spatial intensity variations. The study was focused on the quantitation of white matter lesions in the human brain. A total of 36 images from six brain volumes was analyzed twice by each of two operators, under supervision of a neuroradiologist. Both the intra- and interrater variability of the methods were studied in terms of the average tissue area detected per slice, the correlation coefficients between area measurements, and a measure of similarity derived from the kappa statistic. The results indicate that, compared to a manual method, the use of the semiautomatic technique not only facilitates the analysis of the images, but also has similar or lower intra- and interrater variabilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4853924","pubMedId":"18218550","volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Morphometric analysis of white matter lesions in MR images: method and validation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Morphometric analysis of white matter lesions in MR images: method and validation","sourcePdf":"00363096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038862S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"8321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"827","articleId":"363096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":363099,"authors":[{"name":"E.U.

The reconstructions are based on a Bayesian formulation, where the data are modeled as a collection of independent Poisson random variables and the image is modeled using a Markov random field. A conjugate gradient algorithm is used to compute a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image by maximizing over the posterior density. To ensure nonnegativity of the solution, a penalty function is used to convert the problem to one of unconstrained optimization. Preconditioners are used to enhance convergence rates. These methods generally achieve effective convergence in 15-25 iterations.

In conventional Fourier transform based imaging methods, each of these images is acquired independently so that the temporal resolution possible is limited by the number of spatial encodings (or data points in the Fourier space) collected, or one has to sacrifice spatial resolution for temporal resolution. Here, a generalized series based imaging technique is proposed to address this problem. This technique makes use of the fact that, in most time-sequential imaging problems, the high-resolution image morphology does not change from one image to another, and it improves imaging efficiency (and temporal resolution) over the conventional Fourier imaging methods by eliminating the repeated encodings of this stationary information. Additional advantages of the proposed imaging technique include a reduced number of radio frequency (RF) pulses for data collection, and thus lower RF power deposition. This method should prove useful for a variety of dynamic imaging applications, including dynamic studies of contrast agents and functional brain imaging.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.363100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/8321/00363100.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.363100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient method for dynamic magnetic resonance imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363100/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient method for dynamic magnetic resonance imaging","volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4853920","pubMedId":"18218546","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient method for dynamic magnetic resonance imaging","sourcePdf":"00363100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039378S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"8321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"152","articleId":"363100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363106,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhou","affiliation":["Mount Sinai Medical Center and Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Liang Zhou","id":"37087308799"},{"name":"M.S.

Information about retinal blood vessel morphology is used in grading the severity and progression of a number of diseases. These disease processes are typically followed over relatively long time courses, and subjective analysis of the sequential images dictates the appropriate therapy for these patients. In this research, retinal fluorescein angiograms are acquired digitally in a 1024/spl times/1024 16-b image format and are processed using an automated vessel tracking program to identify and quantitate stenotic and/or tortuous vessel segments. The algorithm relies on a matched filtering approach coupled with a priori knowledge about retinal vessel properties to automatically detect the vessel boundaries, track the midline of the vessel, and extract useful parameters of clinical interest. By modeling the vessel profile using Gaussian functions, improved estimates of vessel diameters are obtained over previous algorithms. An adaptive densitometric tracking technique based on local neighborhood information is also used to improve computational performance in regions where the vessel is relatively straight.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.363106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/8321/00363106.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.363106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8321","startPage":"619","endPage":"626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The detection and quantification of retinopathy using digital angiograms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The detection and quantification of retinopathy using digital angiograms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363106/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4853914","pubMedId":"18218540","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The detection and quantification of retinopathy using digital angiograms","sourcePdf":"00363106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058409S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"8321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"195","articleId":"363106","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363108,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

Ordered subsets methods group projection data into an ordered sequence of subsets (or blocks). An iteration of ordered subsets EM is defined as a single pass through all the subsets, in each subset using the current estimate to initialize application of EM with that data subset. This approach is similar in concept to block-Kaczmarz methods introduced by Eggermont et al. (1981) for iterative reconstruction. Simultaneous iterative reconstruction (SIRT) and multiplicative algebraic reconstruction (MART) techniques are well known special cases. Ordered subsets EM (OS-EM) provides a restoration imposing a natural positivity condition and with close links to the EM algorithm. OS-EM is applicable in both single photon (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). In simulation studies in SPECT, the OS-EM algorithm provides an order-of-magnitude acceleration over EM, with restoration quality maintained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.363108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/8321/00363108.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.363108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8321","startPage":"601","endPage":"609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated image reconstruction using ordered subsets of projection data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated image reconstruction using ordered subsets of projection data","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4853912","pubMedId":"18218538","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated image reconstruction using ordered subsets of projection data","sourcePdf":"00363108.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04795S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"8321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"2594","articleId":"363108","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":363109,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In several applications, particularly in the medical imaging area, effective contrast enhancement for diagnostic purposes can be achieved by including certain basic human visual properties. Here the authors present a novel adaptive algorithm that tailors the required amount of contrast enhancement based on the local contrast of the image and the observer's Just-Noticeable-Difference (JND). This algorithm always produces adequate contrast in the output image, and results in almost no ringing artifacts even around sharp transition regions, which is often seen in images processed by conventional contrast enhancement techniques. By separating smooth and detail areas of an image and considering the dependence of noise visibility on the spatial activity of the image, the algorithm treats them differently and thus avoids excessive enhancement of noise, which is another common problem for many existing contrast enhancement techniques. The present JND-Guided Adaptive Contrast Enhancement (JGACE) technique is very general and can be applied to a variety of images. In particular, it offers considerable benefits in digital radiography applications where the objective is to increase the diagnostic utility of images. A detailed performance evaluation together with a comparison with the existing techniques is given to demonstrate the strong features of JGACE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Histograms","Biomedical imaging","Adaptive algorithm","Digital images","Pixel","Diagnostic radiography","Mammography","X-ray imaging","Attenuation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image processing","vision","image enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive image contrast enhancement","observer characteristics","basic human visual properties","adaptive algorithm","observer's just-noticeable-difference","sharp transition regions","digital radiography","medical diagnostic imaging","ringing artifacts","noise visibility","image spatial activity"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.363111","startPage":"573","endPage":"586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/8321/00363111.pdf","doi":"10.1109/42.363111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive image contrast enhancement based on human visual properties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive image contrast enhancement based on human visual properties","accessionNumber":"4853909","pubMedId":"18218535","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","volume":"13","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive image contrast enhancement based on human visual properties","sourcePdf":"00363111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035488S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"8321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"148","articleId":"363111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":363120,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The set of stacks obtained is optimum with respect to a cost function which accounts for critical parasitics and device area minimization. Device interleaving and common-centroid patterns are automatically introduced when possible, and all symmetry and matching constraints are enforced. The algorithm is based on operations performed on a graph representation of circuit connectivity, exploiting the equivalence between stack generation and path partitioning in the circuit graph. Path partitioning is carried out in two phases: in the first phase, all paths are generated by a dynamic programming procedure. In the second phase, the optimum partition is selected by solving a clique problem. Original heuristics have been introduced, which preserve the optimality of the solution, while effectively improving the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented in the \"C\" programming language. Many test cases have been run, and the quality of results is comparable to that of hand-made circuits. Results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the heuristics employed, even for relatively complex circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.363120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/8322/00363120.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.363120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum CMOS stack generation with analog constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363120/","displayDocTitle":"Optimum CMOS stack generation with analog constraints","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4859897","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum CMOS stack generation with analog constraints","sourcePdf":"00363120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039023S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"29","articleId":"363120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":363121,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

This paper presents the first theoretical treatment of the min-cut replication problem, which is to determine replicated logic that minimizes cut size. A polynomial time algorithm for determining min-cut replication sets for k-partitioned graphs is derived by reducing replication to the problem of finding a maximum flow. The algorithm is extended to hypergraphs and replication heuristics are proposed for the NP-hard problem with size constraints on partition components. These heuristics, which reduce the worst-case running time by a factor of O(k/sup 2/) over previous methods, are applied to designs that have been partitioned into multiple FPGA's.

Since the number of paths is usually exponential in circuit size, this implies very large test sets for most circuits. Not surprisingly, all known analysis and synthesis techniques for 100% path delay fault testability are computationally infeasible on large circuits. We prove that 100% delay fault testability is not necessary to guarantee the speed of a combinational circuit. There exist path delay faults which can never impact the circuit delay (computed using any correct timing analysis method) unless some other path delay faults also affect it. These are termed robust dependent delay faults and need not be considered in delay fault testing. Necessary and sufficient conditions under which a set of path delay faults is robust dependent are proved; this yields more accurate and increased delay fault coverage estimates than previously used. Next, assuming only the existence of robust delay fault tests for a very small set of paths, we show how the circuit speed (clock period) can be selected such that 100% robust delay fault coverage is achieved. This leads to a quantitative tradeoff between the testing effort (measured by the size of the test set) for a circuit and the verifiability of its performance. Finally, under a bounded delay model, we show that the test set size can be reduced while maintaining the delay fault coverage for the specified circuit speed. Examples and experimental results are given to show the effect of these three techniques on the amount of delay fault testing necessary to guarantee correct operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.363125","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/8322/00363125.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.363125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"32","endPage":"44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay fault coverage, test set size, and performance trade-offs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Delay fault coverage, test set size, and performance trade-offs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363125/","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4859892","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay fault coverage, test set size, and performance trade-offs","sourcePdf":"00363125.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044306S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"43","articleId":"363125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":363126,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

We propose a new suboptimal estimator suitable for both known and unknown channels. In the known channel case, the MAP estimator is simplified using a form of conditional decision feedback, resulting in a family of Bayesian conditional decision feedback estimators (BCDFEs); in the unknown channel case, recursive channel estimation is combined with the BCDFE. The BCDFEs are indexed by two parameters: a \"chip\" length and an estimation lag. These algorithms can be used with estimation lags greater than the equivalent channel length and have a complexity exponential in the chip length but only linear in the estimation lags. The BCDFEs are derived from simple assumptions in a model-based setting that takes into account discrete signalling and channel noise. Extensive simulations characterize the performance of the BCDFE and BCDPE for uncoded linear modulations over both known and unknown (nonminimum phase) channels with severe ISI. The results clearly demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed BCDFE over the BCDFE in achieving a desirable performance/complexity tradeoff. Also, a simple adaptive complexity reduction scheme can be combined with the BCDFE resulting in further substantial reductions in complexity, especially for large constellations. Using this scheme, we demonstrate the feasibility of blind 16QAM demodulation with 10/sup -4/ bit error probability at E/sub b//N/sub 0//spl ap/ 18.5 dB on a channel with a deep spectral null.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.363136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.363136","startPage":"155","endPage":"166","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8323/00363136.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian decision feedback techniques for deconvolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian decision feedback techniques for deconvolution","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4860463","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363136/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian decision feedback techniques for deconvolution","sourcePdf":"00363136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051184S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","articleId":"363136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":363137,"authors":[{"name":"Jingdong Lin","affiliation":["Rockwell International Telecommunications, Newport Beach, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jingdong Lin","id":"37087145113"},{"name":"J.G.

The analysis is performed with the help of two new concepts, a tracking filter and a tracking error filter, which are used to calculate the mean square identification error (MSIE). First, we analyze existing algorithms, the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm, the exponential windowed recursive least squares (EW-RLS) algorithm and the rectangular windowed recursive least squares (RW-RLS) algorithm. The equivalence of the three algorithms is demonstrated by employing the frequency domain method. A unified expression for the MSIE of all three algorithms is derived. Secondly, we use the frequency domain analysis method to develop an optimal windowed recursive least squares (OW-RLS) algorithm. We derive the expression for the MSIE of an arbitrary windowed RLS algorithm and optimize the window shape to minimize the MSIE. Compared with an exponential window having an optimized forgetting factor, an optimal window results in a significant improvement in the h MSIE. Thirdly, we propose two types of robust windows, the average robust window and the minimax robust window. The RLS algorithms designed with these windows have near-optimal performance, but do not require detailed statistics of the channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.363137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8323","startPage":"141","endPage":"154","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8323/00363137.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.363137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal tracking of time-varying channels: a frequency domain approach for known and new algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-varying channels","Frequency domain analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Least squares methods","Robustness","Filters","Resonance light scattering","Performance analysis","Least squares approximation","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying channels","tracking filters","filtering theory","frequency-domain analysis","recursive estimation","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying channels","adaptive tracking algorithms","tracking filter","tracking error filter","mean square identification error","least mean squares algorithm","exponential windowed recursive least squares","rectangular windowed recursive least squares","LMS","RLS","frequency domain analysis","optimal windowed recursive least squares","optimized forgetting factor","average robust window","minimax robust window"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimal tracking of time-varying channels: a frequency domain approach for known and new algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4860462","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal tracking of time-varying channels: a frequency domain approach for known and new algorithms","sourcePdf":"00363137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054351S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"55","articleId":"363137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":363139,"authors":[{"name":"Inhyok Cha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Inhyok Cha","id":"37087274426"},{"name":"S.A.

We also propose a stochastic-gradient (SG) training algorithm that adapts all free parameters of the network.

Such a system is suitable for communication over time-dispersive channels subject to fast time-variations, e,g., the HF channel. The known reliable receiver for this system is the nonlinear data-directed estimator (NDDE). This paper presents appropriate equalization methods for this system. A nonstationary innovations representation based on Cholesky factorization is used in order to define a noise whitener and a maximum-likelihood block detector. Also block linear equalizers and block decision-feedback equalizers are derived. For each type we give the zero-forcing and the minimum-mean-squared-error versions. Performance evaluations and comparisons are given. We show that they perform better than conventional equalizers. As compared to the NDDE, the derived block decision-feedback equalizers perform better and are much less complex. Whereas the NDDE uses the Levinson algorithm to solve M/2 Toeplitz systems of decreasing order (where M is the number of symbols per block), the derived equalizers need to process only one Toeplitz system. Moreover, the Schur algorithm, proposed for Cholesky factorization allows us to further reduce the complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.363140","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"110","endPage":"121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8323/00363140.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.363140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel equalization for block transmission systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Technological innovation","Maximum likelihood detection","Decision feedback equalizers","Equations","Dispersion","Channel estimation","Ear","Performance analysis","Modems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiocommunication","time-varying channels","maximum likelihood detection","decision feedback equalisers","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block transmission systems","channel equalization","information symbols","time-dispersive channels","fast time-variations","HF channel","nonlinear data-directed estimator","receiver","nonstationary innovations representation","Cholesky factorization","noise whitener","maximum-likelihood block detector","block linear equalizers","block decision-feedback equalizers","minimum-mean-squared-error","zero-forcing","performance evaluations","Levinson algorithm","Toeplitz systems","Schur algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Channel equalization for block transmission systems","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4860459","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363140/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel equalization for block transmission systems","sourcePdf":"00363140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038382S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"116","articleId":"363140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363141,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The use of diversity techniques like receiver antenna diversity leads to a further improvement of the receiver performance. Hence, ML detectors for coherent receiver antenna diversity (CRAD) have attracted the attention of many authors. However, the complexity of the defector for CRAD can be considerably decreased when the VA is replaced with the M-algorithm, which is a suboptimum tree search algorithm. In the course of this paper, the M-detector is extended to CRAD in the case of maximal-ratio combining (MRC), equal-gain combining (EGC), and selection combining (SC), and its performance in GSM type mobile radio systems is studied by simulations using the radio channel models rural area (RA), typical urban (TU), and bad urban (BU) specified by COST 207. It is demonstrated that this novel M-detector for CRAD can perform similarly to the ML detector for CRAD thus being a favorable alternative.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.363143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8323","startPage":"80","endPage":"88","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8323/00363143.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of a novel M-detector for coherent receiver antenna diversity in a GSM-type mobile radio system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of a novel M-detector for coherent receiver antenna diversity in a GSM-type mobile radio system","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4860456","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of a novel M-detector for coherent receiver antenna diversity in a GSM-type mobile radio system","sourcePdf":"00363143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040067S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"24","articleId":"363143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":363144,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Jones","affiliation":["University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Jones","id":"37383890500"},{"name":"M.A. Wickert","affiliation":["University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Wickert","id":"37352395000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"363144","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Interference constraints","Adaptive arrays","Communication systems","Adaptive systems","Antenna arrays","Computer simulation","Jamming","Covariance matrix","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","synchronisation","adaptive antenna arrays","covariance matrices","filtering theory","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct-sequence spread-spectrum","directionally constrained adaptive beam forming","adaptive antenna array","interference nulling","system model","directional constraint","digital implementation","computer simulations","spread-spectrum code synchronization","tone jammer","off-beam desired signal","system covariance matrix","spread-spectrum filtering","system response","signal quality","code acquisition"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct-sequence spread-spectrum using directionally constrained adaptive beam forming to null interference","doi":"10.1109/49.363144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8323","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8323/00363144.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.363144","startPage":"71","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363144","abstract":"A direct-sequence spread-spectrum communication system using an adaptive antenna array to null interference is examined. The system model is a modification of Compton's (1978) system, using a digital implementation and a directional constraint. Computer simulations are used to compare the behavior of the directionally constrained model with Compton's model with emphasis on spread-spectrum code synchronization. In the directed system, nulling of a tone jammer occurs without respect to direct-sequence code acquisition, and nulling of an off-beam desired signal occurs very slowly. Theoretical results are obtained by using the system covariance matrix, and incorporating the effects of spread-spectrum filtering to compute the system response as a function of time. The simulated results indicate that incomplete directional knowledge may be exploited to enhance signal quality and speed up code acquisition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4860455","displayDocTitle":"Direct-sequence spread-spectrum using directionally constrained adaptive beam forming to null interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct-sequence spread-spectrum using directionally constrained adaptive beam forming to null interference","sourcePdf":"00363144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031236S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"12","articleId":"363144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":363145,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

PSI-CELP is based on CELP, but has more adaptive excitation structures. In voiced frames, instead of conventional random excitation vectors, PSI-CELP converts even the random excitation vectors to have pitch periodicity by repeating stored random vectors as well as by using an adaptive codebook, in silent, unvoiced, and transient frames, the coder stops using the adaptive codebook and switches to fixed random codebooks. The PSI-CELP coder also implements novel structures and techniques: an FIR-type perceptual weighting filter using unquantized LPC parameters, a random codebook with a conjugate structure trained to be robust against channel errors, codebook search with delayed decision, a gain quantization with sloped amplitude, and a moving average prediction coding of LSP parameters, Our speech coder is implemented by DSP chips. Its coded speech quality at 3.6 kb/s with 2.0 kb/s redundancy is comparable to that of the Japanese full-rate VSELP coder at 6.7 kb/s with 4.5 kb/s redundancy. The basic structure of this PSI-CELP coder has been chosen as the Japanese half-rate speech codec for digital cellular telecommunications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363148/","volume":"13","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4860451","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Design of a pitch synchronous innovation CELP coder for mobile communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a pitch synchronous innovation CELP coder for mobile communications","sourcePdf":"00363148.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043928S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"10","articleId":"363148","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":363150,"authors":[{"name":"Song Chong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Song Chong","id":"37382597200"},{"name":"San-qi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"San-qi Li","id":"37292198600"},{"name":"J.

Video traffic statistics are measured in the frequency domain. The low-frequency signal captures the slow time-variation of consecutive scene changes while the high-frequency signal exhibits the feature of strong frame autocorrelation. Our queueing study indicates that the video transmission bandwidth in a finite-buffer system is essentially characterized by the low-frequency signal. We further observe in typical JPEG/MPEG video sequences that the time scale of video scene changes is in the range of a second or longer, which localizes the low-frequency video signal in a well-defined low-frequency band. Hence, in a network design it is feasible to implement dynamic allocation of video transmission bandwidth using on-line observation and prediction of scene changes. Two prediction schemes are examined: recursive least square method and time delay neural network method. A time delay neural network with low-complexity high-order architecture, called \"pi-sigma network,\" is successfully used to predict scene changes. The overall dynamic bandwidth-allocation scheme presented is shown to be promising and practically feasible in obtaining efficient transmission of real-time video traffic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.363150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8323/00363150.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.363150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"12","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive dynamic bandwidth allocation for efficient transport of real-time VBR video over ATM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Predictive dynamic bandwidth allocation for efficient transport of real-time VBR video over ATM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363150/","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4860449","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive dynamic bandwidth allocation for efficient transport of real-time VBR video over ATM","sourcePdf":"00363150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038959S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"118","articleId":"363150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363166,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This is obtained by using a three-terminal test pattern consisting of p/sup +/, n/sup +/ layers realized on top of a n-n/sup +/ (p-p/sup +/) epitaxial wafer, where the p/sup +/-n-n/sup +/ (n/sup +/-p-p/sup +/) surface diode is forward biased to monitor the conductivity of the epilayer. The use of separate terminals for injection control and mobility measurement allows this technique to overcome some limitations presented by other electrical methods available in literature, Mobility values measured up to 2/spl middot/10/sup 17/ cm/sup -3/ are in good agreement with those predicted by the Dorkel and Leturcq's model (1981).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907564","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A measurement method of the injection dependence of the conductivity mobility in silicon","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A measurement method of the injection dependence of the conductivity mobility in silicon","sourcePdf":"00363234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030695S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"10","articleId":"363234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":363260,"authors":[{"name":"Hsinchun Chen","affiliation":["University of Arizona","University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, US"],"lastName":"Hsinchun Chen","id":"37066811500"},{"name":"P.

An experiment on greyhound racing","abstract":"Uncertainty is inevitable in problem solving and decision making. One way to reduce it is by seeking the advice of an expert. When we use computers to reduce uncertainty, the computer itself can become an expert in a specific field through a variety of methods. One such method is machine learning, which involves using a computer algorithm to capture hidden knowledge from data. We compared the prediction performances of three human track experts with those of two machine learning techniques: a decision tree building algorithm (ID3), and a neural network learning algorithm (backpropagation). For our research, we investigated a problem solving scenario called game playing, which is unstructured, complex, and seldom studied. We considered several real life game playing scenarios and decided on greyhound racing, a complex domain that involves about 50 performance variables for eight competing dogs in a race. For every race, each dog's past history is complete and freely available to bettors. This is a large amount of historical information-some accurate and relevant, some noisy and irrelevant-that must be filtered, selected, and analyzed to assist in making a prediction. This large search space poses a challenge for both human experts and machine learning algorithms. The questions then become: can machine learning techniques reduce the uncertainty in a complex game playing scenario? Can these methods outperform human experts in prediction? Our research sought to answer these questions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4920736","volume":"9","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Expert prediction, symbolic learning, and neural networks.

Truth maintenance systems (TMSs) work with inference engines that act as problem solvers within large search spaces. The inference engine explores alternatives, makes choices, and examines the consequences of the choices. If a contradiction is detected during this process, the TMS eliminates it by revising the knowledge base. Together, the TMS and inference engine can solve problems where algorithmic solutions don't exist, and thus offer an efficient way to deal with search spaces that are large due to combinatorial explosions of alternatives. TMSs can be implemented either explicitly in search problem solving tools, or implicitly within applications that solve particular search problems. All applications that solve search problems have something in common that can be extracted and implemented within a tool. This tool can then solve new problems without programming everything from scratch.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","pdfPath":"/iel3/64/8327/00363270.pdf","doi":"10.1109/64.363270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/64.363270","startPage":"46","endPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using truth maintenance systems.

These problems include: computing the convex hull of a set of points in the plane that are given sorted, computing the convex hull of a simple polygon, computing the common intersection of half-planes whose slopes are given sorted, finding the kernel of a simple polygon, triangulating a set of points in the plane that are given sorted, triangulating monotone polygons and star-shaped polygons, and computing the all dominating neighbors of a sequence of values. PRAM algorithms for these problems were previously known to be optimal (i.e., in O(log n) time and using O(n/log n) processors) only on the CREW PRAM, which is a stronger model than the EREW PRAM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.363412","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"41","endPage":"47","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/8330/00363412.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.363412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient geometric algorithms on the EREW PRAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change random access memory","Parallel algorithms","Computational modeling","Kernel","Concurrent computing","Time sharing computer systems","Read-write memory","Solid modeling","Computational geometry","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel algorithms","computational geometry","computational complexity","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometric algorithms","EREW PRAM","parallel geometric algorithms","computational model","convex hull","simple polygon","common intersection","half-planes","kernel","triangulating","monotone polygons","star-shaped polygons","PRAM algorithms","CREW PRAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Efficient geometric algorithms on the EREW PRAM","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4862623","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363412/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient geometric algorithms on the EREW PRAM","sourcePdf":"00363412.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025217S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"26","articleId":"363412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":363424,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

It is now well established how to map problems onto networks so that invalid solutions are never found. It is not as clear how the networks' solutions compare in terms of quality with those obtained using other optimization techniques; such issues are addressed in this paper. A linearized analysis of annealed network dynamics allows a prototypical network solution to be identified in a pertinent eigenvector basis. It is possible to predict the likely quality of this solution by examining optimal solutions in the same basis. Applying this methodology to traveling salesman problems, it appears that neural networks are well suited to the solution of Euclidean but not random problems; this is confirmed by extensive experiments. The failure of a network to adequately solve even 10-city problems is highly significant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.363424","startPage":"280","endPage":"282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8331/00363424.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.363424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations of neural networks for solving traveling salesman problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Traveling salesman problems","Prototypes","Lyapunov method","Equations","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Annealing","Neurofeedback","Neural network hardware","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","travelling salesman problems","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traveling salesman problems","feedback neural networks","combinatorial optimization","linearized analysis","annealed network dynamics","eigenvector basis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Limitations of neural networks for solving traveling salesman problems","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4862618","pubMedId":"18263311","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations of neural networks for solving traveling salesman problems","sourcePdf":"00363424.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051637S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"26","articleId":"363424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":363426,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In the authors' application, the amount of image clutter is extremely high. Under these conditions, detection based on low-level image cues tends to perform poorly. Neural network techniques have been proposed in object detection applications due to proven robust performance characteristics. A neural network filter was designed and trained to detect targets in thermal infrared images. The feature extraction stage was eliminated and raw gray levels were utilized as input to the network. Two fundamentally different approaches were used to design the training sets. In the first approach, actual image data were utilized for training. In the second case, a model-based approach was adopted to design the training set vectors. The training set consisted of object and background data. The neuron transfer function was modified to improve network convergence and speed and the backpropagation training algorithm was used to train the network. The neural network filter was tested extensively on real image data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were determined in each case. The detection and false alarm rates were excellent for the neural network filters. Their overall performance was much superior to that of the size-matched contrast-box filter, especially in the images with higher amounts of visual clutter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363430/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4862612","pubMedId":"18263305","volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A neural network filter to detect small targets in high clutter backgrounds","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network filter to detect small targets in high clutter backgrounds","sourcePdf":"00363430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049779S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"71","articleId":"363430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363432,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

Furthermore, the learning speed of the proposed ETL algorithm is much faster than that of backpropagation learning algorithm in a binary field. Neurons in the proposed BNN employ a hard-limiter activation function, with only integer weights and integer thresholds.

The pulse-mode signal representation and the use of simple logic gates for neural operations lead to a massively parallel yet compact and flexible network architecture, well suited for VLSI implementation. Algebraic neural operations are replaced by stochastic processes using pseudorandom pulse sequences. The distributions of the results from the stochastic processes are approximated using the hypergeometric distribution. Synaptic weights and neuron states are represented as probabilities and estimated as average pulse occurrence rates in corresponding pulse sequences. A statistical model of the noise (error) is developed to estimate the relative accuracy associated with stochastic computing in terms of mean and variance. Computational differences are then explained by comparison to deterministic neural computations. DMNN feedforward architectures are modeled in VHDL using character recognition problems as testbeds. Computational accuracy is analyzed, and the results of the statistical model are compared with the actual simulation results. Experiments show that the calculations performed in the DMNN are more accurate than those anticipated when Bernoulli sequences are assumed, as is common in the literature. Furthermore, the statistical model successfully predicts the accuracy of the operations performed in the DMNN.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8331/00363434.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.363434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.363434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random noise effects in pulse-mode digital multilayer neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonhomogeneous media","Multi-layer neural network","Stochastic resonance","Computer networks","Logic gates","Computer architecture","Stochastic processes","Neural networks","Signal representations","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random noise","hardware description languages","stochastic processes","neural net architecture","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random noise effects","pulse-mode digital multilayer neural networks","stochastic computing techniques","logic gates","massively parallel compact flexible network architecture","VLSI implementation","algebraic neural operations","stochastic processes","pseudorandom pulse sequences","hypergeometric distribution","synaptic weights","neuron states","probabilities","average pulse occurrence rates","statistical model","relative accuracy","deterministic neural computations","feedforward architectures","VHDL","character recognition","computational accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Random noise effects in pulse-mode digital multilayer neural networks","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4862608","pubMedId":"18263301","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random noise effects in pulse-mode digital multilayer neural networks","sourcePdf":"00363434.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049289S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"29","articleId":"363434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363435,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The estimation of the noise density is a major part of the computational burden of LO detection rules. In this paper, adaptive estimation of the noise density is implemented using a radial basis function neural network. Unlike existing algorithms, the present technique places few assumptions on the properties of the noise, and performs well under a wide variety of circumstances.

This is equal to 1.4 Gflops sustained performance. The complete system with 3.8 Gflops peak performance consumes less than 800 W of electrical power and fits into a 19-in rack.

The general approach can also be applied to derive new algorithms. The author then briefly examines some of the complexity issues and limitations intrinsic to gradient descent learning. Throughout the paper, the author focuses on the problem of trajectory learning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363438/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4862604","pubMedId":"18263297","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"6","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"Gradient descent learning algorithm overview: a general dynamical systems perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient descent learning algorithm overview: a general dynamical systems perspective","sourcePdf":"00363438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045795S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"133","articleId":"363438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":363439,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.

More specifically, a decision-based neural network (DBNN) is proposed, which combines the perceptron-like learning rule and hierarchical nonlinear network structure. The decision-based mutual training can be applied to both static and temporal pattern recognition problems. For static pattern recognition, two hierarchical structures are proposed: hidden-node and subcluster structures. The relationships between DBNN's and other models (linear perceptron, piecewise-linear perceptron, LVQ, and PNN) are discussed. As to temporal DBNN's, model-based discriminant functions may be chosen to compensate possible temporal variations, such as waveform warping and alignments. Typical examples include DTW distance, prediction error, or likelihood functions. For classification applications, DBNN's are very effective in computation time and performance. This is confirmed by simulations conducted for several applications, including texture classification, OCR, and ECG analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.363439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8331/00363439.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.363439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8331","startPage":"170","endPage":"181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision-based neural networks with signal/image classification applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decision-based neural networks with signal/image classification applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4862603","pubMedId":"18263296","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision-based neural networks with signal/image classification applications","sourcePdf":"00363439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029841S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"113","articleId":"363439","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":363440,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This paper presents an enhancement of the traditional k-means algorithm. It approximates an optimal clustering solution with an efficient adaptive learning rate, which renders it usable even in situations where the statistics of the problem task varies slowly with time. This modification Is based on the optimality criterion for the k-means partition stating that: all the regions in an optimal k-means partition have the same variations if the number of regions in the partition is large and the underlying distribution for generating input patterns is smooth. The goal of equalizing these variations is introduced in the competitive function that assigns each new pattern vector to the \"appropriate\" region. To evaluate the optimal k-means algorithm, the authors first compare it to other k-means variants on several simple tutorial examples, then the authors evaluate it on a practical application: vector quantization of image data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.363440","startPage":"157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8331/00363440.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.363440","endPage":"169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal adaptive k-means algorithm with dynamic adjustment of learning rate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363440/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimal adaptive k-means algorithm with dynamic adjustment of learning rate","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4862602","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","pubMedId":"18263295","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal adaptive k-means algorithm with dynamic adjustment of learning rate","sourcePdf":"00363440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058438S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"140","articleId":"363440","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363441,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Chee Ku","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Chao-Chee Ku","id":"37087167178"},{"name":"K.Y.

The architecture of DRNN is a modified model of the fully connected recurrent neural network with one hidden layer, and the hidden layer comprises self-recurrent neurons. Two DRNN's are utilized in a control system, one as an identifier called diagonal recurrent neuroidentifier (DRNI) and the other as a controller called diagonal recurrent neurocontroller (DRNC). A controlled plant is identified by the DRNI, which then provides the sensitivity information of the plant to the DRNC. A generalized dynamic backpropagation algorithm (DBP) is developed and used to train both DRNC and DRNI. Due to the recurrence, the DRNN can capture the dynamic behavior of a system. To guarantee convergence and for faster learning, an approach that uses adaptive learning rates is developed by introducing a Lyapunov function. Convergence theorems for the adaptive backpropagation algorithms are developed for both DRNI and DRNC. The proposed DRNN paradigm is applied to numerical problems and the simulation results are included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagonal recurrent neural networks for dynamic systems control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.363441","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8331/00363441.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.363441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363441/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Diagonal recurrent neural networks for dynamic systems control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4862601","pubMedId":"18263294","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagonal recurrent neural networks for dynamic systems control","sourcePdf":"00363441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089364S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"550","articleId":"363441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363444,"authors":[{"name":"R.

While backpropagation will reduce the Euclidean distance between the actual and desired output vectors, the differences between some of the components of these vectors increase in the first iteration. Furthermore, the magnitudes of subsequent weight changes in each iteration are very small, so that many iterations are required to compensate for the increased error in some components in the initial iterations. Our approach is to use a modular network architecture, reducing a K-class problem to a set of K two-class problems, with a separately trained network for each of the simpler problems. Speedups of one order of magnitude have been obtained experimentally, and in some cases convergence was possible using the modular approach but not using a nonmodular network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363444/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4862598","pubMedId":"18263291","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient classification for multiclass problems using modular neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient classification for multiclass problems using modular neural networks","sourcePdf":"00363444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041159S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"288","articleId":"363444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":363445,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The classifier consisted of a multilayer feedforward network window in which the center pixel was classified using gray-scale information within the window. The network was trained by using the backpropagation algorithm with the momentum term. Based on this image segmentation problem, the effect of changing network configuration on the classification performance was also characterized. Factors including topology, rate parameters, training sample set, and initial weights were systematically analyzed. The training set consisted of 75 selected points from a 256/spl times/256 digitized cineangiogram. While different network topologies showed no significant effect on performance, both the learning process and the classification performance were sensitive to the rate parameters. In a comparative study, the network demonstrated its superiority in classification performance.

The backpropagation learning algorithm, or variations hereof, is the standard method applied to the nonlinear optimization problem of adjusting the weights in the network in order to minimize a given cost function. However, backpropagation as a steepest descent approach is too slow for many applications. In this paper a new learning procedure is presented which is based on a linearization of the nonlinear processing elements and the optimization of the multilayer perceptron layer by layer. In order to limit the introduced linearization error a penalty term is added to the cost function. The new learning algorithm is applied to the problem of nonlinear prediction of chaotic time series. The proposed algorithm yields results in both accuracy and convergence rates which are orders of magnitude superior compared to conventional backpropagation learning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363452/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4862590","pubMedId":"18263283","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An accelerated learning algorithm for multilayer perceptrons: optimization layer by layer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An accelerated learning algorithm for multilayer perceptrons: optimization layer by layer","sourcePdf":"00363452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037787S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"126","articleId":"363452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":363453,"authors":[{"name":"Tianping Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Tianping Chen","id":"37276683900"},{"name":"Hong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, USA"],"lastName":"Hong Chen","id":"37367747000"},{"name":"Ruey-wen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Ruey-wen Liu","id":"37275368100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"363453","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the capability of approximating functions in C(R~/sup n/) by three-layered neural networks with sigmoidal function in the hidden layer.

We propose a number of networks and learning algorithms which provide new or alternative tools for feature extraction and data projection. These networks include a network (SAMANN) for J.W. Sammon's (1969) nonlinear projection, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) network, a nonlinear discriminant analysis (NDA) network, and a network for nonlinear projection (NP-SOM) based on Kohonen's self-organizing map. A common attribute of these networks is that they all employ adaptive learning algorithms which makes them suitable in some environments where the distribution of patterns in feature space changes with respect to time. The availability of these networks also facilitates hardware implementation of well-known classical feature extraction and projection approaches. Moreover, the SAMANN network offers the generalization ability of projecting new data, which is not present in the original Sammon's projection algorithm; the NDA method and NP-SOM network provide new powerful approaches for visualizing high dimensional data. We evaluate five representative neural networks for feature extraction and data projection based on a visual judgement of the two-dimensional projection maps and three quantitative criteria on eight data sets with various properties.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.363467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.363467","endPage":"317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8332/00363467.pdf","startPage":"296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks for feature extraction and multivariate data projection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363467/","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks for feature extraction and multivariate data projection","volume":"6","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4901658","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18263314","publicationDate":"March 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks for feature extraction and multivariate data projection","sourcePdf":"00363467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053483S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"400","articleId":"363467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":363468,"authors":[{"name":"V.P.

Little is known, however, about the behavior of the perceptron learning algorithm when the training sets are linearly nonseparable. We present the first known results on the structure of linearly nonseparable training sets and on the behavior of perceptrons when the set of input vectors is linearly nonseparable. More precisely, we show that using the well known perceptron learning algorithm, a linear threshold element can learn the input vectors that are provably learnable, and identify those vectors that cannot be learned without committing errors. We also show how a linear threshold element can be used to learn large linearly separable subsets of any given nonseparable training set. In order to develop our results, we first establish formal characterizations of linearly nonseparable training sets and define learnable structures for such patterns. We also prove computational complexity results for the related learning problems. Next, based on such characterizations, we show that a perceptron does the best one can expect for linearly nonseparable sets of input vectors and learns as much as is theoretically possible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.363468","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8332/00363468.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"331","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.363468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of linearly nonseparable patterns by linear threshold elements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"Classification of linearly nonseparable patterns by linear threshold elements","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4901659","pubMedId":"18263315","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of linearly nonseparable patterns by linear threshold elements","sourcePdf":"00363468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034582S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"25","articleId":"363468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":363469,"authors":[{"name":"B.

An introduction to the relevant computational learning theory is included. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the number of training examples required by a GSLN to guarantee a particular generalization performance. We compare our results to those given previously for feedforward networks of LTEs and show that, on the basis of the currently available bounds, the sufficient number of training examples for GSLNs is typically considerably less than for feedforward networks of LTEs with the same number of weights. We show that the use of self-structuring techniques for GSLNs may reduce the number of training examples sufficient to guarantee good generalization performance, and we provide an explanation for the fact that GSLNs can require a relatively large number of weights.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.363472","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8332/00363472.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"380","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.363472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalization and PAC learning: some new results for the class of generalized single-layer networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"Generalization and PAC learning: some new results for the class of generalized single-layer networks","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4901663","pubMedId":"18263319","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalization and PAC learning: some new results for the class of generalized single-layer networks","sourcePdf":"00363472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090926S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"33","articleId":"363472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363476,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The flexibility of these implementations in accommodating for modifications to the neural network computation and structure is of paramount importance. The performance of many implementation methods today is greatly dependent on the density and the interconnection structure of the neural network model being implemented. A principal contribution of this paper is to demonstrate an implementation method which exploits maximum amount of parallelism from neural computation, without enforcing stringent conditions on the neural network interconnection structure, to achieve this high implementation efficiency. We propose a new reconfigurable parallel processing architecture, the Dynamically Reconfigurable Extended Array Multiprocessor (DREAM) machine, and an associated mapping method for implementing neural networks with regular interconnection structures. Details of the system execution rate calculation as a function of the neural network structure are presented. Several example neural network structures are used to demonstrate the efficiency of our mapping method and the DREAM machine architecture on implementing diverse interconnection structures. We show that due to the reconfigurable nature of the DREAM machine, most of the available parallelism of neural networks can be efficiently exploited.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.363476","startPage":"407","endPage":"421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.363476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8332","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8332/00363476.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing regularly structured neural networks on the DREAM machine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363476/","displayDocTitle":"Implementing regularly structured neural networks on the DREAM machine","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4901667","pubMedId":"18263323","publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing regularly structured neural networks on the DREAM machine","sourcePdf":"00363476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068934S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"19","articleId":"363476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":363477,"authors":[{"name":"E.B.

In designing dense, high-speed realizations of neural networks, understanding the consequences of using simple neurons with significant weight errors is important. Similarly, in developing training algorithms, it is important to understand the effects of small weight changes to determine the required precision of the weight updates at each iteration. In this paper, an analysis of the sensitivity of feedforward neural networks (Madalines) to weight errors is considered. We focus our attention on Madalines composed of sigmoidal, threshold, and linear units. Using a stochastic model for weight errors, we derive simple analytical expressions for the variance of the output error of a Madaline. These analytical expressions agree closely with simulation results. In addition, we develop a technique for selecting the appropriate accuracy of the weights in a neural network realization. Using this technique, we compare the required weight precision for threshold versus sigmoidal Madalines. We show that for a given desired variance of the output error, the weights of a threshold Madaline must be more accurate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363478/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4901669","pubMedId":"18263325","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"6","issue":"2","displayDocTitle":"The selection of weight accuracies for Madalines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The selection of weight accuracies for Madalines","sourcePdf":"00363478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038964S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"92","articleId":"363478","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":363479,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

The fault model abstracts a variety of failure modes for permanent stuck-at type faults. A procedure is developed to build FT ANNs by replicating the hidden units. It exploits the intrinsic weighted summation operation performed by the processing units to overcome faults. Metrics are devised to quantify the FT as a function of redundancy. A lower bound on the redundancy required to tolerate all possible single faults is analytically derived. Less than triple modular redundancy (TMR) cannot provide complete FT for all possible single faults. The actual redundancy needed to synthesize a completely FT net is specific to the problem at hand and is usually much higher than that dictated by the general lower bound. The conventional TMR scheme of triplication and majority voting is the best way to achieve complete FT in most ANNs. Although the redundancy needed for complete FT is substantial, the ANNs exhibit good partial FT to begin with and degrade gracefully. The first replication yields maximum enhancement in partial FT compared with later successive replications. For large nets, exhaustive testing of all possible single faults is prohibitive, so the strategy of randomly testing a small fraction of the total number of links is adopted. It yields partial FT estimates that are very close to those obtained by exhaustive testing. When the fraction of links tested is held fixed, the accuracy of the estimate generated by random testing is seen to improve as the net size grows.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4901670","pubMedId":"18263326","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Complete and partial fault tolerance of feedforward neural nets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complete and partial fault tolerance of feedforward neural nets","sourcePdf":"00363479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043956S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"109","articleId":"363479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":363480,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The neurons of a single-layer network are sequentially trained using a recursive least squares squares (RLS) type algorithm to extract the principal components of the input process. The optimality criterion is based on retaining the maximum information contained in the input sequence so as to be able to reconstruct the network inputs from the corresponding outputs with minimum mean squared error. The proof of the convergence of the weight vectors to the principal eigenvectors is also established. A simulation example is given to show the accuracy and speed advantages of this algorithm in comparison with the existing methods. Finally, the application of this learning algorithm to image data reduction and filtering of images degraded by additive and/or multiplicative noise is considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.363480","startPage":"457","endPage":"469","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8332/00363480.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.363480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principal component extraction using recursive least squares learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Additive noise","Neural networks","Computer networks","Stochastic processes","Neurons","Resonance light scattering","Data mining","Image reconstruction","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","neural nets","stochastic processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","data reduction","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal component extraction","recursive least squares learning","single-layer neural network","stationary vector stochastic process","sequential training","optimality criterion","maximum information retention","network input reconstruction","minimum mean squared error","convergence proof","weight vectors","principal eigenvectors","simulation","accuracy","speed advantages","image data reduction","degraded image filtering","additive noise","multiplicative noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363480/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"Principal component extraction using recursive least squares learning","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4901671","pubMedId":"18263327","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principal component extraction using recursive least squares learning","sourcePdf":"00363480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034795S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"97","articleId":"363480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":363481,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A trivial approach is to use a conventional approach to convert the DCT into DFT and to apply Goertzel's algorithm for the rest of the realization. However, this method is inefficient and requires the realization of long length DFT's. In our approach, we suggest using some suitable mappings to convert a prime length DCT into two suitable transforms with approximately half of the original length to effect fast realization. The number of operations is greatly reduced and the structure is extremely regular.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/8334/00363541.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.363541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.363541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8334","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=363541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct formulation for the realization of discrete cosine transform using recursive structure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Hardware","Digital signal processing","Fourier transforms","Very large scale integration","Discrete transforms","Digital filters","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","recursive filters","discrete cosine transforms","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct formulation","discrete cosine transform","recursive structure","prime length DCT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Direct formulation for the realization of discrete cosine transform using recursive structure","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4867974","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct formulation for the realization of discrete cosine transform using recursive structure","sourcePdf":"00363541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033023S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"15","articleId":"363541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363542,"authors":[{"name":"Sa Hyun Bang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, and Center for Neural Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sa Hyun Bang","id":"37087488144"},{"name":"O.T.-C.

Such devices can efficiently perform classes of computation (e.g. factorisation) which are believed to be intractable on any classical computer. This makes it highly desirable to construct such devices. In this paper, we address the last remaining theoretical obstacle to such a construction, namely the problem of stability or error correction. This problem is more substantial in quantum computation than in classical computation because of the delicate nature of the interference phenomena on which quantum computation depends. We present a new, purely quantum mechanical method of error correction, which has no classical analogue, but can serve to stabilise coherent quantum computations. Like the classical methods, it utilises redundancy, but it does not depend on measuring intermediate results of the computation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHYCMP.1994.363698","doi":"10.1109/PHYCMP.1994.363698","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Workshop on Physics and Computation.

Any logical or arithmetic operation can be performed in this scheme. QCA's provide a valuable concrete example of quantum computation in which a number of fundamental issues come to light. We examine the physics of the computing process in this paradigm. We show to what extent thermodynamic considerations impose limits on the ultimate size of individual QCA arrays.

For many applications such as remote operated vehicle (ROV) operation it is desirable to transmit video information in the form of camera pictures or side scan sonar images from the ROV to a surface vessel. For shallow water operation where the range is much greater than the water depth the most detrimental problem is that of inter symbol interference due to multipath. The paper presents a novel solution to this problem by using an adaptive beamformer to spatially filter the direct path signal from the multipath. Results obtained during sea trials are presented and demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1994.363829","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","startPage":"I/313","endPage":"I/316 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/2951/8342/00363829.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1994.363829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-sea acoustic remote communications utilising an adaptive receiving beamformer for multipath suppression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Remotely operated vehicles","Data communication","Communication industry","Cameras","Sonar","Sea surface","Interference","Service robots","Telemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","intersymbol interference","interference suppression","array signal processing","acoustic signal processing","spatial filters","digital communication","differential phase shift keying","data communication","telemetry","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subsea acoustic remote communications","adaptive receiving beamformer","multipath suppression","remote operated vehicle operation","ROV operation","video information","camera pictures","side scan sonar images","shallow water operation","intersymbol interference","adaptive beamformer","path signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sub-sea acoustic remote communications utilising an adaptive receiving beamformer for multipath suppression","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4846492","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363829/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-sea acoustic remote communications utilising an adaptive receiving beamformer for multipath suppression","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00363829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030549S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"14","articleId":"363829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":363838,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

The protocol borrows from existing algorithms for packet radio networks and presents methods to decrease delay and retransmission of packets to conserve the limited modem power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1994.363865","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","startPage":"I/883","endPage":"I/888 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/2951/8342/00363865.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1994.363865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient store-and-forward protocol for a shallow-water acoustic local area network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Local area networks","Modems","Underwater acoustics","Circuits","Sea surface","Routing protocols","Packet radio networks","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Demodulation","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oceanographic techniques","oceanographic equipment","geophysical techniques","geophysical equipment","data acquisition","telemetry","underwater sound","protocols","modems","local area networks","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data telemetry","ocean bottom sensor","sea geophysical method","measurement technique","store-and-forward protocol","shallow-water acoustic local area network","random deployment","mobile acoustic modem","littoral zone","coast","connectivity","adaptively learned","adaptive learning","initialization","routing","maintenance","rerouting algorithm","acoustic telemetry","data acquisition ALAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient store-and-forward protocol for a shallow-water acoustic local area network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4851428","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363865/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient store-and-forward protocol for a shallow-water acoustic local area network","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00363865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024289S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"17","articleId":"363865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363872,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

Conventional delay-sum beamforming (DSBF) is a computationally intensive operation requiring on the order of N/sup 2/ delay/sum operations per sample period, where N is the number of sensor elements. The FBF algorithm requires on the order of NlogN operations, which can result in considerable savings for large values of N. The algorithm defines multiple stages of processing. In the first FBF stage, DSBF is done for multiple subarrays with a limited number of beams. At each successive stage, the beams from pairs of subarrays are combined and additional beam steering directions are developed. The sidelobe level performance of FBF is found to be a function of beam spacing. The computational requirements of FBF are evaluated and compared to DSBF. The savings grow rapidly with array size, though can still be appreciable for as little as 32 elements. A simulated example of the algorithm on a wide-band signal is shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1994.363872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8342","startPage":"I/211","endPage":"I/216 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/2951/8342/00363872.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast beamforming algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"A fast beamforming algorithm","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4851371","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast beamforming algorithm","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00363872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022603S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"6","articleId":"363872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":363873,"authors":[{"name":"V.

When usual parameters are chosen to achieve an accurate lateral resolution, the depth of field provided by focused beamforming is insufficient to build a flexible imaging system. Moreover, the accuracy of range determination is directly proportional to the signal bandwidth. The authors propose an evaluation methodology, namely, confidence measure, which, is calculated on the beam signal profile, and permits one to determine the exact position of an attenuated pulse in time by a comparison with an expected model of the beam signal. The confidence measure makes it possible to improve the precision of range determination and to generate an algorithm that, without any a priori knowledge of a scene, succeeds in focusing each beam signal correctly. Finally, they compare, in terms of image quality, sensitivity to noise, and processing time, the results obtained by the proposed algorithm with those obtained by fixed and dynamic focalizations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4846498","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Focused beamforming for underwater imaging: depth of field and range resolution optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Focused beamforming for underwater imaging: depth of field and range resolution optimization","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00363873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034789S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"1","articleId":"363873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":363890,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.R.

The most difficult effect to overcome in a time varying underwater channel is multipath. An adaptive beamformer uses an adaptive algorithm to maximise the signal strength received from a desired direction while simultaneously inserting nulls in directions of interferers. Both the Frost (1972) and LMS algorithms are being investigated at Newcastle University, and an objective comparison is made of their performance using synthetic and real data. A flexible and powerful state of the art multichannel data acquisition system, based around the TMS320C40 DSP, has been designed and commissioned. This system is being used to capture and store large volumes of data generated during sea trials. The data acquired is analysed off-line to allow the investigation of various phenomena affecting underwater communications (e.g. multipath), and to provide a realistic method of comparing the performance of a variety of different modulation techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1994.363892","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","startPage":"I/296","endPage":"I/301 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/2951/8342/00363892.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1994.363892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of adaptive beamformer performance and experimental verification of applications in high data rate digital underwater communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remotely operated vehicles","Underwater communication","Underwater vehicles","Data communication","Adaptive algorithm","Least squares approximation","Data acquisition","Digital signal processing","Data analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication","data communication","underwater sound","array signal processing","adaptive signal processing","data acquisition","least mean squares methods","acoustic signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamformer performance","high data rate","digital underwater communications","remote operated vehicle","ROV","underwater data transmission","video","acoustical communication link","time varying underwater channel","multipath","adaptive algorithm","signal strength","LMS algorithms","multichannel data acquisition system","TMS320C40 DSP","modulation techniques","Newcastle University"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of adaptive beamformer performance and experimental verification of applications in high data rate digital underwater communications","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4846489","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363892/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of adaptive beamformer performance and experimental verification of applications in high data rate digital underwater communications","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00363892.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036068S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"6","articleId":"363892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":363905,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

A multipath medium results in temporal spread of the transmitted pulses as well as time-variant propagation delays and attenuation factors. In underwater acoustics communications applications, the operational frequency range often lies between 1.5 kHz-1.5 MHz. The technique proposed in the paper to mitigate the multipaths, employs a joint optimization criterion on the time, space end autocorrelation domain simultaneously. A combination of self-optimized receiver and spatial diversity suits appropriately for the case of \"very shallow\", as well as \"extremely shallow\" channels with a range to depth ratio larger than 10:1. The blind equalization algorithm is able to recover the phase even in the case of non-minimum phase systems, which is a difficult task for \"very shallow\" ocean channels subject mainly to surface reverberation. Multilevel modulation schemes can be employed such as high-level multiple phase shift keying modulation MPSK, in order to obtain a high data-rate acoustic telemetry link. However the modulation complexity is bounded by the induced intersymbol interference and the reduction of the noise margins. Finally, simulation results with QPSK signaling are presented to verify efficiency at low signal-to-reverberation ratios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1994.363905","startPage":"I/317","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/2951/8342/00363905.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1994.363905","endPage":"I/322 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath compensation for underwater acoustic communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/363905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Multipath compensation for underwater acoustic communication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4846493","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath compensation for underwater acoustic communication","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00363905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024548S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"14","articleId":"363905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":363958,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Results are presented for the placement of 31 elements within a linear lattice of 63 locations under the design constraints of center and end position occupancy and bilateral symmetry. \"Fitness\" of the configuration is given in terms of mainlobe width and sidelobe levels of the corresponding response pattern.

An AUV which is equipped with an underwater video camera and tethered by a fiber optic cable is capable of providing invaluable visual data for ocean research. To extend the exploration range of such AUV's, an idea has been proposed to capture and process underwater video on-board the vehicle then transmit it acoustically to a remote site via an underwater acoustic channel. Video applications process large volumes of data and in order for an underwater channel to accommodate the transmission of this data, extremely high compression is required. The work presented here addresses this massive compression problem by employing the wavelet decomposition in conjunction with vector quantization for coding still underwater images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1994.364101","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/2951/8343/00364101.pdf","startPage":"II/533","endPage":"II/537 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1994.364101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater image compression using the wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364101/","displayDocTitle":"Underwater image compression using the wavelet transform","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4881102","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater image compression using the wavelet transform","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00364101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046467S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"7","articleId":"364101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":364183,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Similar to a cellular telephone network, an acoustic network consists of a number of nodes or modems which adaptively route digital data packets between scientific sensors and a data collection or viewing point. A significant milestone in the development of such a network has been the recent demonstration of a multichannel adaptive receiver for coherent underwater communications. As the current generation of commercial telemetry devices do not meet the computational requirements of this algorithm, a new compact, high-performance modem has been developed at WHOI. This unit has a processing capacity of more than 80 Mflops (million floating-point operations per second) and contains a full-featured personal computer. The capabilities of the new modem are reviewed together with preliminary results from two deployments of a network of six modems. The results highlight the ability of the new modem to autonomously monitor network configuration and channel quality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4864911","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","displayDocTitle":"The design and performance of a compact underwater acoustic network node","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design and performance of a compact underwater acoustic network node","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00364243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026623S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"12","articleId":"364243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":364244,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The experiment was conducted across the Solent, at Southampton in the United Kingdom. The Solent is a extremely shallow channel with a severe multipath and high shipping noise. Excellent performance was obtained under favourable transmission conditions. The performance of the system is characterised by the bit error rate at various symbol and bit rates and ranges. The calculated performance is then compared to a theoretical model. The channel is characterised using ray theory in a constant temperature medium to initialise the impulse response, then randomly varying the delay and amplitude of the separate arrivals. This represents the effect of the fluctuating sea surface upon the reflected sound waves. The validity of this comparison is then discussed in the context of other published experimental work in this field.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1994.364245","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","startPage":"III/478","endPage":"III/482 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/2951/8344/00364245.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1994.364245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the performance of an underwater acoustic communications system and comparison with a stochastic model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Underwater acoustics","Ocean temperature","Acoustic testing","System testing","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Telemetry","Acoustic noise","Bit error rate","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telemetry","underwater sound","performance evaluation","differential phase shift keying","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic communications system","stochastic model","DPSK acoustic data telemetry system","Birmingham University","Solent","Southampton","United Kingdom","shallow channel","multipath","shipping noise","performance","transmission conditions","bit error rate","symbol rates","ray theory","constant temperature medium","impulse response","sea surface","reflected sound waves","50 kHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the performance of an underwater acoustic communications system and comparison with a stochastic model","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4864913","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364245/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the performance of an underwater acoustic communications system and comparison with a stochastic model","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00364245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022905S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"16","articleId":"364245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":364246,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

Digital techniques allow to achieve a synthesized speech with a quality close to the telephonic one. The input speech signal is compressed down to 5.45 kbit/s using a CELP coder. The bit rate is 6 kbit/s before channel coding and expected to be about 8 kbits/s after channel coding. A QPSK modulation with differential encoding was chosen to transmit the useful signal. For the receiver the authors use a scheme where synchronization and equalization (FSE+DFE) were jointly optimized. The whole system (unidirectional link) has been implemented on single DSPs (Motorola 56001) and tested successfully in a very difficult environment (IFREMER pool).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1994.364247","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","startPage":"III/489","endPage":"III/494 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/2951/8344/00364247.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1994.364247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward a digital acoustic underwater phone","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater acoustics","Speech coding","Speech synthesis","Transmitters","Decoding","Quadrature phase shift keying","Digital signal processing","Prototypes","Signal synthesis","Channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","quadrature phase shift keying","linear predictive coding","synchronisation","underwater sound","digital communication","telephony","acoustic receivers","transmitters","speech codecs","data compression","decision feedback equalisers","telephone sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital acoustic underwater phone","synthesized speech","input speech signal","CELP coder","bit rate","channel coding","QPSK modulation","differential encoding","synchronization","equalization","unidirectional link","Motorola 56001","5.45 to 8 kbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward a digital acoustic underwater phone","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4864915","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364247/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a digital acoustic underwater phone","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00364247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025178S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"9","articleId":"364247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":364248,"authors":[{"name":"A.

From recordings obtained regularly during the year in the Mediterranean Sea, the authors show in the first part the propagation modifications and their influence on the transmission conditions. From many experimental results already obtained in the authors' laboratory, they present briefly a general characterization of the underwater medium as a horizontal acoustic communication channel. They emphasize that this channel within communication frequencies range (inferior to 10 kHz) does not behave like a Rayleigh channel. They present a channel simulator, which takes into account the horizontal and vertical receiver movement and the bandpass modulation to reconstruct the interferences generated by the multipath propagation. Those interferences represent the most difficult problem in underwater communication.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1994.364248","startPage":"III/495","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/2951/8344/00364248.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1994.364248","endPage":"III/500 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater acoustic channel simulations for communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Underwater acoustic channel simulations for communication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"4864916","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater acoustic channel simulations for communication","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"00364248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02414S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2951","citationCount":"28","articleId":"364248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":364249,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The isolator prevents the build-up of the backward-ASE and results in an amplifier with high gain and near-quantum-limited noise figure (NF). The optimum position of the isolator has been calculated as a function of the pump power so that minimum NF and maximum gain are achieved simultaneously. It is shown that under practical pump powers, the optimized composite EDFA exhibits a gain improvement of about 5 dB and a NF reduction in excess of 1.5 dB when compared with an optimized conventional EDFA. It is also shown that with further optimization the composite EDFA can be employed in a practical fiber link as a pre-amplifier without the use of an input isolator. Finally, a high-gain composite EDFA has been experimentally demonstrated which exhibits a gain of 51 dB (54 dB) and NF of 3.1 dB for only 435 mW (93 mW) of pump power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.364402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.364402","startPage":"472","endPage":"480","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/8348/00364402.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient erbium-doped fiber amplifiers incorporating an optical isolator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Efficient erbium-doped fiber amplifiers incorporating an optical isolator","publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4899594","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364402/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient erbium-doped fiber amplifiers incorporating an optical isolator","sourcePdf":"00364402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055741S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"18","articleId":"364402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":364404,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

As an amplifier small signal gain efficiencies of 8.1 dB/mN were attained with a maximum gain of 36.5 dB being achieved for around 17-18 mW of launched pump power. As a laser a maximum slope efficiency of 84% and a minimum threshold for oscillation of 330 /spl mu/W was also demonstrated for this system. Furthermore by suppressing all reflections down to <36 dB superfluorescent or ASE output was observed.

Of the three, we discard the APM technique because of structural and power-handling difficulties. We then discuss theoretically and confirm experimentally that the combination of SPM plus gain dispersion can lead to pulsewidth reduction by a factor of 2 to 2.5 but not more, in agreement with the analysis of Haus and Silberberg. Finally, while KLM can be very effective as a fast saturable absorber in many types of lasers, we find that its application to lamp-pumped YAG lasers is frustrated by instabilities in thermal focusing and transverse mode position characteristic of this type of laser.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4899608","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optical-Kerr-enhanced mode locking of a lamp-pumped Nd:YAG laser","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical-Kerr-enhanced mode locking of a lamp-pumped Nd:YAG laser","sourcePdf":"00364416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034545S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"2","articleId":"364416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":364418,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Miao Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"lastName":"Xin Miao Zhao","id":"37087484736"},{"name":"J.-C.

It is shown that the resultant ionization channel induces a lightning like discharge at half of the natural self-breakdown voltage in nitrogen or air. The laser triggered discharging process is studied by monitoring the voltage between two planar electrodes. The effects of oxygen on the induced breakdown is investigated. A complete theoretical model is presented to simulate: (1) the electron seeding; and (2) the evolution of the plasma of electron-ion in the applied field. The results of the theory verified by small scale experiments-are used to simulate the process of laser triggered lightning in atmosphere, and helps to define the parameters of a laser system for lightning protection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/8348/00364418.pdf","startPage":"599","endPage":"612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.364418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.364418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8348","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulse induced lightning discharges in gases","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical pulses","Lightning","Laser theory","Atmospheric modeling","Nitrogen","Ionization","Voltage","Laser modes","Plasma simulation","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightning","lightning protection","high-speed optical techniques","laser beam effects","photoionisation","electrodes","discharges (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulse","induced lightning discharges","gases","ultraviolet pulses","low energy","high peak power","ionize oxygen","nitrogen","three-photon ionization","four-photon ionization","ionization channel","lightning like discharge","natural self-breakdown voltage","laser triggered discharging process","planar electrodes","electron seeding","plasma","electron-ion","applied field","small scale experiments","laser triggered lightning","atmosphere","0.2 mJ","200 fs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulse induced lightning discharges in gases","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4899610","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulse induced lightning discharges in gases","sourcePdf":"00364418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08368S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"199","articleId":"364418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":364429,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

It builds on previous approaches to IC yield prediction employing a Monte Carlo approach for flexibility, with behavioral simulation and response surfaces for speed. To analyze complex mixed-signal IC's, a novel feature termed the correction layer is introduced. Complex mixed-signal IC's have tests which are highly nonlinear. Consequently, it can be difficult to build accurate response surfaces whose response variables are the results of such tests. The correction layer is introduced to overcome this problem. It enables a response surface to be accurately used by the method. A commercial hard disk drive IC is analyzed as an example to show the necessity of having the correction layer in order to produce accurate parametric yield predictions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8349/00364442.pdf","doi":"10.1109/4.364442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.364442","startPage":"279","endPage":"285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric yield prediction of complex, mixed-signal IC's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364442/","displayDocTitle":"Parametric yield prediction of complex, mixed-signal IC's","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4907136","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric yield prediction of complex, mixed-signal IC's","sourcePdf":"00364442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032479S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"5","articleId":"364442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":364445,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Such networks are possible using the COFDM system, with large guard intervals (more than 200 /spl mu/s) to absorb long echoes. In order to limit the spectral efficiency loss to about 20%, very long size fast Fourier transforms (up to 8 K complex points) have to be performed in real time for the demodulation of every COFDM symbol (every 1 ms). This paper presents the first VLSI single chip dedicated to the computation of direct or inverse fast Fourier transforms of up to 8192 complex points. Due to its pipelined architecture, it can perform an 8 K FFT every 400 /spl mu/s and a 1 K FFT every 50 /spl mu/s. All the storage is onchip, so that no external memories are required. A new internal result scaling technique, called convergent block floating point, has been introduced in order to minimize the required storage for a given quantization noise, The chip, 1 cm/sup 2/ large with 1.5 million transistors, has been designed in a 3.3 V-0.5 /spl mu/m triple-level metal CMOS process and is fully functional. The 8 K complex FFT function could therefore be introduced in the coming years in digital terrestrial TV receivers at low cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.364445","doi":"10.1109/4.364445","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8349/00364445.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast single-chip implementation of 8192 complex point FFT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fast single-chip implementation of 8192 complex point FFT","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907139","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast single-chip implementation of 8192 complex point FFT","sourcePdf":"00364445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039813S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"125","articleId":"364445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":364446,"authors":[{"name":"U.

In practice, the complexity of adiabatic approaches has made them impractical. We describe a new CMOS logic family-adiabatic dynamic logic (ADL)-that is the result of combining adiabatic theory with conventional CMOS dynamic logic. ADL gates are simple, general, readily cascadable, and may be fabricated in a standard CMOS process. A chain of 1000 ADL inverters has been constructed in 0.9 /spl mu/m CMOS and successfully tested at 250 MHz. This result, together with comprehensive circuit simulation, suggest that ADL offers an order of magnitude reduction in power consumption over conventional CMOS circuitry.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8349/00364447.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.364447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.364447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adiabatic dynamic logic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","Logic devices","Capacitors","Inverters","Energy dissipation","Energy exchange","Equivalent circuits","CMOS process","Circuit testing","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adiabatic dynamic logic","CMOS logic family","ADL gates","power consumption reduction","250 MHz","0.9 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Adiabatic dynamic logic","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907141","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adiabatic dynamic logic","sourcePdf":"00364447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055119S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"145","articleId":"364447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":364450,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Many techniques have been developed in this area. Any compression technique can be modeled as a three-stage process. The first stage can be generally called a signal processing stage where an image or video signal is converted into a different domain. Usually, there is no or little loss of information in this stage. The second stage is quantization where loss of information occurs. The third stage is lossless coding that generates the compressed bit stream. The purpose of the signal processing stage is to convert an image or video signal into such a form that quantization can achieve better performance than without the signal processing stage. Because the quantization stage is the place where most of compression is achieved and loss of information occurs, it is naturally the central stage of any compression technique. Since scalar quantization or vector quantization may be used in the second stage, the operation in the first stage should be scalar-based or vector-based respectively in order to match the second stage so that the compression performance can be optimized. In this paper, we summarize the most recent research results on vector-based signal processing and quantization techniques that have shown high compression performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.364459","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8350/00364459.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.364459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8350","startPage":"317","endPage":"335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector-based signal processing and quantization for image and video compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364459","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Vector-based signal processing and quantization for image and video compression","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364459/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"83","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4884290","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector-based signal processing and quantization for image and video compression","sourcePdf":"00364459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054786S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"29","articleId":"364459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":364460,"authors":[{"name":"T.

However, as the bit rate is lowered, most of the existing techniques, as well as current standards, such as JPEG, H. 261, and MPEG-1 produce highly visible degradations in the reconstructed images primarily due to the information loss caused by the quantization process. In this paper, we propose an iterative technique to reduce the unwanted degradations, such as blocking and mosquito artifacts while keeping the necessary detail present in the original image. The proposed technique makes use of a priori information about the original image through a nonstationary Gauss-Markov model. Utilizing this model, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate is obtained iteratively using mean field annealing. The fidelity to the data is preserved by projecting the image onto a constraint set defined by the quantizer at each iteration. The proposed solution represents an implementation of a paradigm we advocate, according to which the decoder is not simply undoing the operations performed by the encoder, but instead it solves an estimation problem based on the available bitstream and any prior knowledge about the source image. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested on a JPEG, as well as on an H.261-type video codec. It is shown to be effective in removing the coding artifacts present in low bit rate compression.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.364460","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8350/00364460.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.364460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image and video compression algorithms based on recovery techniques using mean field annealing","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Image and video compression algorithms based on recovery techniques using mean field annealing","volume":"83","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4884289","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image and video compression algorithms based on recovery techniques using mean field annealing","sourcePdf":"00364460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075382S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"55","articleId":"364460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":364461,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

They are well suited to the problem of image compression due to their massively parallel and distributed architecture. Their characteristics are analogous to some of the features of our own visual system, which allow us to process visual information with much ease. For example, multilayer perceptions can be used as nonlinear predictors in differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM). Such predictors have been shown to increase the predictive gain relative to a linear predictor. Another active area of research is in the application of Hebbian learning to the extraction of principal components, which are the basis vectors for the optimal linear Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT). These learning algorithms are iterative, have some computational advantages over standard eigendecomposition techniques, and can be made to adapt to changes in the input signal. Yet another model, the self-organizing feature map (SOFM), has been used with a great deal of success in the design of codebooks for vector quantization (VQ). The resulting codebooks are less sensitive to initial conditions than the standard LBG algorithm, and the topological ordering of the entries can be exploited to further increasing the coding efficiency and reducing the computational complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","volume":"83","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4884288","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural network approaches to image compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network approaches to image compression","sourcePdf":"00364461.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10248S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"169","articleId":"364461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":364462,"authors":[{"name":"O.

It chooses linear filters on textured regions and morphological filters otherwise. A simple and efficient texture detection criterion is proposed and applied to the adaptive decomposition.

Also dedicated decoder chips are included Programmable video signal processors are classified and specified as homogeneous and heterogenous processor architectures. Architectures are presented for reported design examples from the literature. Heterogenous processors outperform homogeneous processors because of adaptation to the requirements of special, subtasks by dedicated modules. The majority of heterogenous processors incorporate dedicated modules for high performance subtasks of high regularity as DCT and block matching.

However, the demand for transmission bandwidth and storage space in the digital radiology environment, especially picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and teleradiology, and the proliferating use of various imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, ultrasonography, nuclear medicine, computed radiography, and digital subtraction angiography, continue to outstrip the capabilities of existing technologies. The availability of lossy coding techniques for clinical diagnoses further implicates many complex legal and regulatory issues. This paper reviews the recent progress of lossless and lossy radiologic image compression and presents the legal challenges of using lossy compression of medical records. To do so, we first describe the fundamental concepts of radiologic imaging and digitization. Then, we examine current compression technology in the field of medical imaging and discuss important regulatory policies and legal questions facing the use of compression in this field. We conclude with a summary of future challenges and research directions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"83","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4884283","displayDocTitle":"Radiologic image compression-a review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiologic image compression-a review","sourcePdf":"00364466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129184S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"153","articleId":"364466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":364468,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service (ACATS) was formed to advise the FCC on the technology and systems suitable for delivery of high definition service over terrestrial broadcast channels. Four digital HDTV systems where tested at the Advanced Television Testing Center. All the systems gave excellent performance, but the results were inconclusive and a plan for a second round of tests was prepared. As each of the four systems where being readied for retest. The proponents of the four individual digital HDTV proposals worked together to define a single HDTV system which incorporated the best technology from the individual systems. The consortium of companies, called the Grand Alliance (GA), announced a combined system and submitted it to ACATS for consideration. After ACATS certification, the GA began construction of a prototype system to submit for laboratory testing at the end of 1994. This paper describes the video compression subsystem and the hardware prototype. The preprocessing, motion estimation, quantization, and rate control subsystems are described. The system uses bidirectional motion compensation, discrete cosine transform, quantization and Huffman coding. The resulting bitstream is input into a transport system which uses fixed length packets. The multiplex transport stream is input into the 8-VSB transmission system. Finally, the specifics of the hardware implementation are described and some simulation results are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.364468","startPage":"158","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8350/00364468.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.364468","endPage":"174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Grand Alliance system for US HDTV","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","displayDocTitle":"The Grand Alliance system for US HDTV","volume":"83","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4884281","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Grand Alliance system for US HDTV","sourcePdf":"00364468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039085S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"27","articleId":"364468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":364469,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is a nonlinear mapping of an input data (feature) vector into a scalar output, i.e., it maps numbers into numbers. Fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic establish the specifics of the nonlinear mapping. This tutorial paper provides a guided tour through those aspects of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic that are necessary to synthesize an FLS. It does this by starting with crisp set theory and dual logic and demonstrating how both can be extended to their fuzzy counterparts. Because engineering systems are, for the most part, causal, we impose causality as a constraint on the development of the FLS. After synthesizing a FLS, we demonstrate that it can be expressed mathematically as a linear combination of fuzzy basis functions, and is a nonlinear universal function approximator, a property that it shares with feedforward neural networks. The fuzzy basis function expansion is very powerful because its basis functions can be derived from either numerical data or linguistic knowledge, both of which can be cast into the forms of IF-THEN rules.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.364485","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8351/00364485.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.364485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8351","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"345","endPage":"377","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic systems for engineering: a tutorial","volume":"83","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4915092","publicationDate":"March 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic systems for engineering: a tutorial","sourcePdf":"00364485.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063698S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1195","articleId":"364485","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":364486,"authors":[{"name":"J.-S.R.

Next, we show that the performance of the FMRLC can be significantly enhanced by exploiting failure detection and identification (FDI) information to achieve a \"performance adaptive\" system that seeks an appropriate performance level depending on the type of failure that occurred. We develop an expert supervision strategy for the FMRLC that uses only information about the time at which a failure occurs and show that it achieves higher performance control reconfiguration than an unsupervised FMRLC. In addition we show that similar performance can be achieved if we only use estimates of the failure time and magnitude obtained from a fuzzy estimator. We close our study with a brief assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches used in this paper.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8351/00364491.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"483","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.364491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.364491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8351","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expert supervision of fuzzy learning systems for fault tolerant aircraft control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Learning systems","Fault tolerant systems","Aerospace control","Aircraft","Actuators","Sensor systems","Military computing","Modems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","military aircraft","fuzzy control","expert systems","fault diagnosis","intelligent control","learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expert supervision","fuzzy learning systems","fault tolerant aircraft control","fuzzy model reference learning controller","F-16 fighter aircraft","actuator failures","failure detection","failure identification","performance adaptive system","fuzzy estimator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"Expert supervision of fuzzy learning systems for fault tolerant aircraft control","volume":"83","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4915098","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expert supervision of fuzzy learning systems for fault tolerant aircraft control","sourcePdf":"00364491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157647S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"58","articleId":"364491","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":364509,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

The expression thus characterizes fundamental limits on EEG dipole localization performance due to the effects of both model uncertainty and statistical measurement noise. Expressions are derived for the cases of multivariate Gaussian and gamma distribution priors, and examples are given to illustrate the derived bounds when the radii and conductivities of a four-concentric sphere head model are allowed to be random. The joint MAP estimate of location/model parameters is then examined as a means of achieving robustness to deviations from an ideal head model. Random variations in both the multiple sphere radii and the layer conductivities are shown, via the stochastic Cramer-Rao bounds and Monte Carlo simulation of the MAP estimator, to have the most impact on localization performance in high SNR regions, where finite sample effects are not the limiting factors. This corresponds most often to spatial regions that are close to the scalp electrodes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/8352/00364509.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"241","doi":"10.1109/10.364509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.364509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEG dipole localization bounds and MAP algorithms for head models with parameter uncertainties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"EEG dipole localization bounds and MAP algorithms for head models with parameter uncertainties","publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4907230","pubMedId":"7698778","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG dipole localization bounds and MAP algorithms for head models with parameter uncertainties","sourcePdf":"00364509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052548S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"36","articleId":"364509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":364511,"authors":[{"name":"L.T.

In traditional analysis, the poles are obtained by zeroing the denominator of the model transfer function, expressed as a function of the AR coefficients. Here, two algorithms for the direct updating and tracking of movements of poles of an AR time-variant model on the basis of the innovation given to the coefficients are presented and investigated. The introduced algorithms are based upon (1) the classical linearization method and (2) a recursive method to compute the roots of a polynomial, respectively. Here, applications in the field of heart rate variability (HRV) signal analysis are presented and efficient tools are proposed for quantitative extraction of spectral parameters (power and frequency of the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components) for the monitoring of the action of the autonomic nervous system in transient pathophysiological events. These computational methods seem to be very attractive for HRV applications, as they inherit the peculiarity of recursive time-variant identification, and provide a more immediate comprehension of the spectral process characteristics when expressed in terms of poles and AR spectral components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364511/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4907232","pubMedId":"7698780","publicationDate":"March 1995","displayDocTitle":"Pole-tracking algorithms for the extraction of time-variant heart rate variability spectral parameters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pole-tracking algorithms for the extraction of time-variant heart rate variability spectral parameters","sourcePdf":"00364511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089466S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"53","articleId":"364511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":364520,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

EVENODD employs the addition of only two redundant disks and consists of simple exclusive-OR computations. This redundant storage is optimal, in the sense that two failed disks cannot be retrieved with less than two redundant disks. A major advantage of EVENODD is that it only requires parity hardware, which is typically present in standard RAID-5 controllers. Hence, EVENODD can be implemented on standard RAID-5 controllers without any hardware changes. The most commonly used scheme that employes optimal redundant storage (i.e., two extra disks) is based on Reed-Solomon (RS) error-correcting codes. This scheme requires computation over finite fields and results in a more complex implementation. For example, we show that the complexity of implementing EVENODD in a disk array with 15 disks is about 50% of the one required when using the RS scheme. The new scheme is not limited to RAID architectures: it can be used in any system requiring large symbols and relatively short codes, for instance, in multitrack magnetic recording. To this end, we also present a decoding algorithm for one column (track) in error.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.364531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.364531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8353/00364531.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EVENODD: an efficient scheme for tolerating double disk failures in RAID architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"EVENODD: an efficient scheme for tolerating double disk failures in RAID architectures","volume":"44","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4899533","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364531/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EVENODD: an efficient scheme for tolerating double disk failures in RAID architectures","sourcePdf":"00364531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08526S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"427","articleId":"364531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":364534,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The same MP-LFSR that generates random patterns to cover easy to test faults is loaded with seeds to generate deterministic vectors for difficult to test faults. The seeds are obtained by solving systems of linear equations involving the seed variables for the positions where the test cubes have specified values. We demonstrate that MP-LFSR's produce sequences with significantly reduced probability of linear dependence compared to single polynomial LFSR's. We present a general method to determine the probability of encoding as a function of the number of specified bits in the test cube, the length of the LFSR and the number of polynomials. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that the probability of encoding a test cube with s specified bits in an s-stage LFSR with 16 polynomials is 1-10/sup -6/. We then present the new BIT scheme that allows for an efficient encoding of the entire test set. Here the seeds are grouped according to the polynomial they use and an implicit polynomial identification reduces the number of extra bits per seed to one bit. The paper also shows methods of processing the entire test set consisting of test cubes with varied number of specified bits. Experimental results show the tradeoffs between test data storage and test application time while maintaining complete fault coverage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Built-in test for circuits with scan based on reseeding of multiple-polynomial linear feedback shift registers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.364534","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8353/00364534.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.364534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364534/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"Built-in test for circuits with scan based on reseeding of multiple-polynomial linear feedback shift registers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4899536","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Built-in test for circuits with scan based on reseeding of multiple-polynomial linear feedback shift registers","sourcePdf":"00364534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034545S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"307","articleId":"364534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":364536,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

Experimental results are presented for several error detection techniques, and they demonstrate the effectiveness of the software-based error injection tool in evaluating the dependability properties of complex systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.364536","doi":"10.1109/12.364536","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8353/00364536.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FERRARI: a flexible software-based fault and error injection system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FERRARI: a flexible software-based fault and error injection system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4899538","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FERRARI: a flexible software-based fault and error injection system","sourcePdf":"00364536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019329S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"221","articleId":"364536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":364582,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The actuator consists of a permanent magnet connected to an electromagnet. The gravity force of the table is suspended by permanent magnets, and vibrations due to disturbances are controlled by changing magnetic fluxes of the permanent magnets. When the horizontal disturbance applies to the magnetic levitation supports of the table, the location of the magnets moves from the set position. This implies that the magnetic forces in both the horizontal and vertical directions vary due to base disturbances. An analysis of the magnetic levitation force, magnetic stiffness, and control force, is presented first and then a method of vibration control is presented. The control method is based on a disturbance cancellation combining an optimal regulator with consideration of interferences of the magnetic forces between horizontal and vertical motions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnets","Magnetic levitation","Force control","Electromagnetic forces","Actuators","Vibration control","Magnetic forces","Electromagnets","Gravity","Magnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnets","magnetic levitation","vibration control","actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncontact permanent magnet levitation table","electromagnetic control","vibration isolation method","direct disturbance cancellation combining optimal regulators","drag-force type electromagnetic actuators","gravity force","vibrations","horizontal disturbance","magnetic forces","base disturbances","magnetic stiffness","control force"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.364582","startPage":"885","endPage":"896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/6571405/00364582.pdf","doi":"10.1109/20.364582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A noncontact permanent magnet levitation table with electromagnetic control and its vibration isolation method using direct disturbance cancellation combining optimal regulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"A noncontact permanent magnet levitation table with electromagnetic control and its vibration isolation method using direct disturbance cancellation combining optimal regulators","accessionNumber":"4861084","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","volume":"31","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2013","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A noncontact permanent magnet levitation table with electromagnetic control and its vibration isolation method using direct disturbance cancellation combining optimal regulators","sourcePdf":"00364582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034543S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"6571405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"34","articleId":"364582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":364586,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The problem is solved directly in rectangular coordinates, obtaining the potential created by a uniformly charged ellipsoid everywhere by a variational method, in contrast to the usual method due to Dirichlet. Using the preceding result, we calculate the potential created by a uniformly magnetized ellipsoid in any external and internal points, as a superposition of the potentials created by two uniformly charged ellipsoids, which have opposite charge densities and slightly shifted centers. Finally, we find the solutions for the potential and field in any point external to a uniformly magnetized spheroid in rectangular coordinates. The results are checked with the classical ones obtained in spheroidal coordinates, finding a complete agreement except in one case. A discussion of this discrepancy is given. Finally, we determine how the magnetic field behaves with distance from the ellipsoid boundaries, which is very useful for corrections of the stray field flux and search coil design and also for models of particulate recording media with uniaxial anisotropy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.364589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6571405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.364589","endPage":"836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/6571405/00364589.pdf","startPage":"830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"External fields created by uniformly magnetized ellipsoids and spheroids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364589/","displayDocTitle":"External fields created by uniformly magnetized ellipsoids and spheroids","volume":"31","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4861077","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"External fields created by uniformly magnetized ellipsoids and spheroids","sourcePdf":"00364589.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040234S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"6571405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"20","articleId":"364589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":364608,"authors":[{"name":"W.O.

Lagrangian formulation exhibits several advantages in modeling electromagnetic (EM) diffusion problems with moving conductors. It results in a symmetric coefficient matrix which reduces computational cost and central memory requirement. It also eliminates numerical instability at hypervelocity. In the simulation of EM launchers, Lagrangian formulation facilitates EM analyses including end (breech and muzzle) effects, and the effects of imperfect rails and structural deformation. A detailed Lagrangian formulation of mechanically, and thermally coupled electromagnetic diffusive processes with moving conductors is presented in this paper. It is based on the quasistatic Maxwell's equations in terms of dual potentials: magnetic vector potential and electric scalar potential. With the Coulomb gauge condition, magnetic vector potential is uniquely determined. The formulation has been implemented in the finite element program 'EMAP3D' (Electro-Mechanical Analysis Program in 3 Dimension). The thermally coupled electromagnetic simulation of a railgun is illustrated. The distributions of current density, magnetic field, and temperature are presented. Also the profiles of velocity and current are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/8355/00364626.pdf","startPage":"604","endPage":"609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.364626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.364626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8355","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lagrangian formulation for mechanically, thermally coupled electromagnetic diffusive processes with moving conductors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lagrangian functions","Electromagnetic coupling","Conductors","Magnetic analysis","Electric potential","Electromagnetic modeling","Symmetric matrices","Computational efficiency","Computational modeling","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["railguns","thermal diffusion","finite element analysis","electrical engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lagrangian formulation","thermally coupled electromagnetic diffusive processes","mechanically coupled electromagnetic diffusive processes","moving conductors","EM diffusion","symmetric coefficient matrix","computational cost reduction","numerical instability elimination","hypervelocity","EM launchers simulation","breech effect","muzzle effect","imperfect rails","structural deformation","quasistatic Maxwell's equations","dual potentials","magnetic vector potential","electric scalar potential","Coulomb gauge condition","EMAP3D finite element program","railgun simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"A Lagrangian formulation for mechanically, thermally coupled electromagnetic diffusive processes with moving conductors","volume":"31","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4866949","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lagrangian formulation for mechanically, thermally coupled electromagnetic diffusive processes with moving conductors","sourcePdf":"00364626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033877S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"115","articleId":"364626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":364631,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Rails and projectile are divided in a high number of small-size parallelepipeds, so that temperature and current density may be imagined uniform in every parallelepiped. By integrating Ohm's law over each parallelepiped an equivalent R-L electrical network is obtained, whose resistive and inductive parameters are evaluated by means of explicit analytical expressions, possible in the case of discretization in parallelepipeds. The voltage fall in the boundary layers between rail and moving armature are taken into account by means of suitable driven generators. The position of the projectile is deduced by the application of the virtual displacement principle, where the discretization in parallelepipeds allows one to express the Lorentz's force again by means of explicit analytical relations. The nonlinear differential equations system so obtained fully simulates the behaviour of a solid armature railgun, and is solved in time, updating at each time-step the coefficients variable with current density, temperature, and projectile displacement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4866944","volume":"31","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of the transient diffusion of current and heat in railguns via an equivalent network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of the transient diffusion of current and heat in railguns via an equivalent network","sourcePdf":"00364631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039306S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","articleId":"364631","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":364727,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The PR channels in combination with Viterbi decoder give partial response maximum-likelihood (PRML) systems which exhibit a good performance. The bit error rates for several PRML systems are obtained by computer simulation, where a Lorentzian channel with additive white Gaussian noise is assumed. The results shows that PR(1,1,-1,-1) system has an excellent performance in high density recording for a system in which the small transition spacings required by our write equalization is allowed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/8356/00364788.pdf","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.364788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.364788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of PRML systems by write and read equalization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Propagation delay","Space vector pulse width modulation","Magnetic recording","Degradation","Viterbi algorithm","Maximum likelihood decoding","Bit error rate","Computer simulation","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial response channels","maximum likelihood detection","magnetic recording noise","digital magnetic recording","Viterbi decoding","white noise","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PRML systems","write equalization","read equalization","partial response channel","DC-free waveforms","high-frequency noise","eye opening degradation","Viterbi decoder","partial response maximum-likelihood","bit error rates","computer simulation","Lorentzian channel","additive white Gaussian noise","high density recording","transition spacings","digital magnetic recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"A study of PRML systems by write and read equalization","volume":"31","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907443","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of PRML systems by write and read equalization","sourcePdf":"00364788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034308S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","articleId":"364788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":364789,"authors":[{"name":"Jaekyun Moon","affiliation":["Center for Micromagnetics and Information Technologies, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Jaekyun Moon","id":"37276690000"},{"name":"Weining Zeng","affiliation":["Center for Micromagnetics and Information Technologies, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Weining Zeng","id":"37343065100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"364789","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":616},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equalization for maximum likelihood detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364789","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","Viterbi algorithm","Detectors","Equalizers","Nonlinear filters","Ground penetrating radar","Maximum likelihood estimation","Magnetic separation","Delay","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial response channels","maximum likelihood detection","magnetic recording noise","Viterbi detection","equalisers","jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detectors","minimum mean-square error technique","recording channel","Viterbi detector","noise correlation","equalizer output","jitter-dominant channel","unconditioned channel noise samples","monic constraint","target response","fixed-energy constraint","partial response targets"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) technique has been used to equalize the recording channel in order to facilitate the application of the Viterbi detector. The resulting performance has been compared with that of the optimal equalization system which yields the minimum probability of error at the output of the Viterbi detector. The results indicate that depending on the constraint used in the MMSE design, the amount of noise correlation varies significantly at the equalizer output, which in turn makes a large difference in the performance of the Viterbi detector. In particular, in the jitter-dominant channel where unconditioned channel noise samples are highly correlated, the monic constraint on the equalizer target response tends to whiten the noise samples at the equalizer output. This results in a significant performance improvement of the monic constraint upon the fixed-energy constraint as well as the popular partial response targets of the form (1-D)(1+D)/sup n/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.364789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.364789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/8356/00364789.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364789/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"Equalization for maximum likelihood detectors","volume":"31","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4907444","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalization for maximum likelihood detectors","sourcePdf":"00364789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060043S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"132","articleId":"364789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":364791,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The detector performance for each polynomial is evaluated versus normalized recording density for systems with 100% electronic noise, and then for systems with 100% media noise. Simple mathematical relations are developed that show how to convert these results into plots of detector performance for contours of constant areal density. In the case of 100% electronic noise, it is shown that with the proper choice of bit length and width EPR4 yields the lowest probability of error at any areal density.

We consider a MI effect for which the domain walls are perpendicular to the current and field direction. Thus, the magnetization induced by current proceeds, via both the wall movement and moment rotation. The magnetic responses of impedance in wires and films have some common features and can be understood from the same mechanism. The sensitivity of the magnetic response in a small sample (1 mm length and a few micrometer thickness) is about 10%/Oe in wires and 5%/Oe in films. The model describes well the existing experimental data for moderate frequencies, There is some quantitative discrepancy for the case of a very strong skin effect, where the position dependence of basic magnetostatic parameters is important.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/8356/00364815.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.364815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.364815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Giant magneto-impedance in Co-rich amorphous wires and films","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amorphous magnetic materials","Amorphous materials","Wires","Magnetic domain walls","Magnetostatics","Magnetic domains","Impedance","Skin effect","Magnetic films","Magnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["giant magnetoresistance","amorphous magnetic materials","skin effect","magnetic domains","magnetic domain walls","magnetic moments","soft magnetic materials","cobalt alloys","iron alloys","silicon alloys","boron alloys","ferromagnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["giant magneto-impedance","amorphous wires","skin effect","dynamical magnetization processes","domain walls","wall movement","moment rotation","amorphous films","magnetic response","magnetostatic parameters","soft magnetic materials","CoFeSiB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"Giant magneto-impedance in Co-rich amorphous wires and films","volume":"31","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907468","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Giant magneto-impedance in Co-rich amorphous wires and films","sourcePdf":"00364815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104197S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"507","articleId":"364815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":364825,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Bae Cho","affiliation":["ATR Human Information Processing Research Laboratories, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan","Center for Artificial Intelligence Research and Computer Science Department, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea","Department of Computer Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Bae Cho","id":"37281323400"},{"name":"J.H.

First, separation hyperplanes for classes are extracted from a trained neural network.

Using fuzzy rules defined for each class, input data are directly classified without the use of the neural network. This method is applied to a number recognition system as well as to a blood cell classification system.

Two behaviors are independently designed at the design stage and then combined them by a behavior selector at the running stage. A behavior selector using a bistable switching function chooses a behavior at each action step so that the mobile robot can go for the goal position without colliding with obstacles. Fuzzy logic maps the input fuzzy sets representing the mobile robot's state space determined by sensor readings to the output fuzzy sets representing the mobile robot's action space. Fuzzy rule bases are built through the reinforcement learning which requires simple evaluation data rather than thousands of input-output training data. Since the fuzzy rules for each behavior are learned through a reinforcement learning method, the fuzzy rule bases can be easily constructed for more complex environments. In order to find the mobile robot's present state, ultrasonic sensors mounted at the mobile robot are used. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a series of simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","publicationDate":"March 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4899649","volume":"25","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A sensor-based navigation for a mobile robot using fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sensor-based navigation for a mobile robot using fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning","sourcePdf":"00364859.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034801S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"172","articleId":"364859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":364863,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Xiong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, The School of Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"lastName":"Han-Xiong Li","id":"37087149558"},{"name":"H.B.

A phase plane is used to bridge the gap between the time-response and rule base.

An adaptive gain method is also proposed to help the database design and the controller tuning. Much of the FLC design can be shifted to the design and tuning of gain. A good performance can be achieved both in transient state and steady state without use of multidecision tables. Application of FLC with these new methodologies is presented for a thermal process with a varying deadtime to show the robust performance of FLC and the effectiveness of these methodologies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4899652","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A new methodology for designing a fuzzy logic controller","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new methodology for designing a fuzzy logic controller","sourcePdf":"00364863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030779S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"135","articleId":"364863","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":364865,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Bipartite graphs are commonly drawn in the plane so that all vertices lie on two parallel vertical lines, and an important requirement in drawing such graphs is to minimize edge crossings. Such a problem is NP-complete even when the position of the vertices on one layer is held fixed. This paper presents a heuristic, called the assignment heuristic, for edge crossing minimization in bipartite graphs, which works by reducing the problem to an assignment problem. The main idea of the assignment heuristic is to position simultaneously all the vertices of one layer, so that the mutual interaction of the position of all the vertices can be taken into account. We also show that the idea underlying the assignment heuristic can be effectively applied in other cases requiring edge crossing minimization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.364865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.364865","endPage":"521","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/8358/00364865.pdf","startPage":"515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The assignment heuristic for crossing reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364865/","displayDocTitle":"The assignment heuristic for crossing reduction","volume":"25","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4899654","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The assignment heuristic for crossing reduction","sourcePdf":"00364865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040566S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"17","articleId":"364865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":364929,"authors":[{"name":"K.

That article examined spread spectrum, standard radio and infrared (IR) technologies for intra-office wireless networking. In May of that year the FCC released the ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) bands for spread spectrum local communications. Although ISM bands are not restricted to any specific application, wireless local area networks (LANs) were one of the most prominent applications that were envisioned by the rule makers in the FCC. Since 1985, many small start-up companies, as well as small groups in larger companies, have started to develop wireless LANs. The present paper provides a sequel to Pahlavan by providing an overview of the past and present of the wireless LAN industry, as well as a perspective of the future directions that encompass a vision for a ubiquitous local wireless computing environment that leads to a fusion of communications and computation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/35.364929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/8360/00364929.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.364929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trends in local wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=364929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364929/","displayDocTitle":"Trends in local wireless networks","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4942735","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trends in local wireless networks","sourcePdf":"00364929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058028S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"47","articleId":"364929","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":364959,"authors":[{"name":"E.I.

SeaMaster software upgrades the human-machine interface of telemanipulators by letting operators control the actual and simulated manipulators either separately or simultaneously. It includes a data-driven control mode. In contrast to direct teleoperation, where the operator directly controls the telemanipulator and uses only video displays for feedback, the computer offers a means of automatically generating joint commands and uncoupling undesired motions of the ROV. The paper describes how the SeaMaster project achieved these goals through computer simulation. The simulator was designed to study the complex motions of an underwater remotely operated vehicle-manipulator system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/364959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4918442","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"SeaMaster: an ROV-manipulator system simulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SeaMaster: an ROV-manipulator system simulator","sourcePdf":"00364959.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02056S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"9","articleId":"364959","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365006,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

We present a novel concurrent scheduling and resource allocation algorithm which exploits inter-iteration and intra-iteration precedence constraints. The novel algorithm implicitly performs algorithmic transformations, such as pipelining and retiming, on the data-flow graphs during the scheduling process to produce solutions which are as good as those previously published and which executes in less time. MARS is capable of producing optimal and near-optimal schedules in fractions of seconds. Previous synthesis systems have focused on DSP algorithms which have single or lumped delays in the recursive loops. In contrast, MARS is capable of generating valid architectures for algorithms which have randomly distributed delays. MARS exploits these delays to produce more efficient architectures and allows our system to be more general. We are able to synthesize architectures which meet the iteration bound of any algorithm by unfolding, retiming, and pipelining the original data-flow graph.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-level DSP synthesis using concurrent transformations, scheduling, and allocation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.365120","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/8364/00365120.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.365120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365120/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"High-level DSP synthesis using concurrent transformations, scheduling, and allocation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4934824","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-level DSP synthesis using concurrent transformations, scheduling, and allocation","sourcePdf":"00365120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054929S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"43","articleId":"365120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365122,"authors":[{"name":"Weitong Chuang","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Weitong Chuang","id":"37381781500"},{"name":"S.S.

We consider the problem of choosing optimal gate sizes from the library to minimize a cost function (such as total circuit area) while meeting the timing constraints imposed on the circuit. After presenting an efficient algorithm for combinational circuits, we examine the problem of minimizing the area of a synchronous sequential circuit for a given clock period specification. This is done by appropriately selecting a size for each gate in the circuit from a standard-cell library, and by adjusting the delays between the central clock distribution node and individual flip-flops. Experimental results show that by formulating gate size selection together with the clock skew optimization as a single optimization problem, it is not only possible to reduce the optimized circuit area, but also to achieve faster clocking frequencies. Finally, we address the problem of making this work applicable to very large synchronous sequential circuits by partitioning these circuits to reduce the computational complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.365122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.365122","endPage":"320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/8364/00365122.pdf","startPage":"308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing and area optimization for standard-cell VLSI circuit design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365122/","displayDocTitle":"Timing and area optimization for standard-cell VLSI circuit design","volume":"14","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4934826","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing and area optimization for standard-cell VLSI circuit design","sourcePdf":"00365122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046719S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"19","articleId":"365122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365123,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

We model the interconnect resources as a graph. A routing solution is represented as a set of disjoint trees, each connecting all terminals of a net, on the graph. An expansion router is used for connecting a net. Initially, nets are connected independently of one another. Conflicts among nets over the usage of interconnect resources are resolved iteratively by a rip-up and rerouter, which is guided by a simulated evolution-based optimization technique. The proposed approach has been implemented in a program called TRACER-fpga. As compared with CGE and SEGA, TRACER-fpga in general requires fewer routing tracks at the expense of longer wiring delay. It is suitable for low-speed applications such as hardware emulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.365127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/8364/00365127.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.365127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TRACER-fpga: a router for RAM-based FPGA's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365127/","displayDocTitle":"TRACER-fpga: a router for RAM-based FPGA's","volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4934831","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TRACER-fpga: a router for RAM-based FPGA's","sourcePdf":"00365127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039637S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"12","articleId":"365127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365200,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Channel-passing and channel-dropping transmittance characteristics of the TCRR are derived by using a combination of transfer matrix and chain matrix formulations. The dependence of the transmittance characteristics on the amplitude coupling ratios of the three directional couplers are investigated, and optimum design relationships are determined. It is shown that the TCRR is ideally a nonterminating filter at antiresonance. An extensive comparison between the TCRR and a double-coupler ring resonator (DCRR) with same radius of curvature, waveguide propagation loss, coupling loss and finesse, is carried out. It is shown that the TCRR, by suitably sizing its waveguide lengths, has a free spectral range double that of the DCRR and features also higher transmission at resonance and better extinction ratio. These characteristics make the TCRR particularly advantageous for frequency selective filtering applications in optical frequency division multiplexing transmission systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.365200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.365200","endPage":"157","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8367/00365200.pdf","startPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical analysis of triple-coupler ring-based optical guided-wave resonator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365200/","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical analysis of triple-coupler ring-based optical guided-wave resonator","volume":"13","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4899275","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical analysis of triple-coupler ring-based optical guided-wave resonator","sourcePdf":"00365200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046832S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"37","articleId":"365200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365205,"authors":[{"name":"D.V.

Anomalous time delay caused by both absorption and emission at 1.535 /spl mu/m has been theoretically calculated and experimentally measured. A pump power dependence of anomalous time delay in rare-earth-doped fibers has been theoretically calculated and experimentally investigated. It has been shown that pump power fluctuations lead to propagation time jitter in Er/sup 3+/-doped fiber amplifiers. The pulse interaction due to refractive index change caused by gain saturation is predicted.

These new models take into account incomplete ASK modulation, nonzero laser linewidth, and spontaneous emission noise from the optical amplifier in both polarization control (PC) and polarization diversity (PD) receiver configurations. The penalty associated with the polarization diversity configuration is shown to be consistently under 1 dB for a wide range of ASK modulation depths. The penalty due to the noise in the orthogonal polarization decreases with ASK modulation depth. We find optimum optical filter bandwidths and linewidth-induced performance penalties as a function of ASK modulation depth and linewidth. We provide detailed tables of optimum filter bandwidths for bath PC and PD receivers using both the rigorous method and the Gaussian approximation; the Gaussian approximation frequently underestimates the optimum bandwidth values. A linewidth-induced floor in the minimum usable ASK modulation depth is found for nonzero linewidth and a fixed optical filter bandwidth. Though the Gaussian approximation is found to be accurate within 1.5 dB in all computed cases for optimum optical filter bandwidths, it does not predict the floor accurately in the case of a nonoptimum filter bandwidth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4899295","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Preamplifier ASK system performance with incomplete ASK modulation: influence of ASE and laser phase noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preamplifier ASK system performance with incomplete ASK modulation: influence of ASE and laser phase noise","sourcePdf":"00365220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038068S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"2","articleId":"365220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":365221,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The sensitivity of the predicted lesion size to the uncertainties in the iso-dose constant, attenuation coefficient, and thermal dose threshold of necrosis was studied. The predicted lesion size appears to be independent of attenuation at some high attenuation values and certain depth in tissue. Thus, for a given target depth, a proper selection of frequency could minimize the lesion size variability due to uncertainty in the tissue attenuation. The predicted lesion size was less dependent on the uncertainties in the iso-dose constant and thermal dose of necrosis. The predictions of the model were compared with experimental data in rabbit muscle, and experimental data in cat and rat brain measured by others. The agreement was found to be good in most of the experiments.

The reduction in size has gained importance as 2-D array transducers with up to 1000 independent channels become accepted to improve diagnostic ultrasound images. The authors describe the analysis, design, fabrication and testing of a prototype silicon photoconductive semiconductor switch (PCSS). The monolithic silicon PCSS was used in combination with an infrared semiconductor diode laser with a fiber optic \"pigtail\" to shock excite and burst excite a 2-D array transducer element resonant at 2.5 MHz. Optically controlled voltage, current, and ultrasound pulses are compared to those from conventional electronic shock excitation and narrow band Doppler pulses. The optically triggered ultrasound pulse for single shock excitation produced 30 V spikes at the 2-D array element with a fall time of 200 nsec and a rise time of 2 /spl mu/sec with a peak current through the transducer element of 34 mA. An optically produced burst of eight pulses at a frequency of 2.5 MHz produced 11 V spikes at the transducer with a fall time under 100 nsec and a rise time of approximately 300 nsec. The peak current per pulse was 25 mA through the transducer element.

Numerically determined values of the Green's function are used and interpolated either linearly or using a modified variant of Ingebrigtsen's formula. Such basic parameters as stopband width, stopband center frequency, wave velocity and attenuation in the stopband are found. These parameters can be used in the coupling-of-modes (COM) analysis and design of SAW devices. The analysis includes bulk wave radiation and scattering. The dependence of the corresponding attenuation coefficient on frequency is determined. Results obtained allow the determination directly and properly of the COM parameters and the design of SAW devices having large number of electrodes most precisely and rapidly. Numerical results for Rayleigh waves on YZ-LiNbO/sub 3/ and leaky waves on 36/spl deg/YX-LiTaO/sub 3/ substrates are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.365241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/8368/00365241.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.365241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8368","startPage":"280","endPage":"293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Periodic Green's functions analysis of SAW and leaky SAW propagation in a periodic system of electrodes on a piezoelectric crystal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Periodic Green's functions analysis of SAW and leaky SAW propagation in a periodic system of electrodes on a piezoelectric crystal","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4908322","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic Green's functions analysis of SAW and leaky SAW propagation in a periodic system of electrodes on a piezoelectric crystal","sourcePdf":"365241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03642S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"44","articleId":"365241","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365242,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This ceramic consists of two layers in which the poling directions are opposite and the individual thicknesses are different. It is possible to control the values of relative electromechanical coupling factors in the fundamental and the second harmonic by changing the thickness ratio. A thickness ratio of 1:0.7 was decided from computer simulation based on the Mason's model. A sufficient resolution has been shown from the fact that the intima of the carotid artery could be distinguished by an actually fabricated probe with dual frequencies of 3.75 and 7.5 MHz. Also, the sensitivity of this probe in the Doppler mode at 5 cm depth from the surface has been improved as much as 5 dB over that of a conventional one.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Probes","Medical services","Biomedical equipment","Bioceramics","Nonhomogeneous media","Image resolution","Thickness control","Computer simulation","Carotid arteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","probes","biomedical equipment","ultrasonic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual frequency ultrasonic probe","multilayer ceramic","high resolution B mode images","high sensitivity Doppler mode images","poling directions","second harmonic","thickness ratio","relative electromechanical coupling factors","Mason's model","carotid artery intima","medical instrumentation","medical diagnostic imaging","3.75 MHz","7.5 MHz","5 cm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/58.365242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/8368/00365242.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.365242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual frequency ultrasonic probe for medical applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A dual frequency ultrasonic probe for medical applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365242/","volume":"42","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4908323","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual frequency ultrasonic probe for medical applications","sourcePdf":"365242.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033961S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"43","articleId":"365242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":365243,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

In each of these applications delay estimation is performed using speckle signals which are at least partially decorrelated relative to one another. Delay estimates which utilize such data are subject to large errors known as false peaks and smaller magnitude errors known as jitter. While false peaks can sometimes be removed through nonlinear processing, jitter errors place a fundamental limit on the performance of delay estimation techniques. The authors apply the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound to derive an analytical expression which predicts the magnitude of jitter errors incurred when estimating delays using radio frequency (RF) data from speckle targets. The analytical expression presented includes the effects of signal decorrelation due to physical processes, corruption by electronic noise, and a number of other factors. Simulation results are presented which show that the performance of the normalized cross correlation algorithm closely matches theoretical predictions. These results indicate that for poor signal to noise ratios (0 dB) a small improvement in signal to noise ratio can dramatically reduce jitter magnitude. At high signal to noise ratios (30 dB) small amounts of signal decorrelation can significantly increase the magnitude of jitter errors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.365243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/8368/00365243.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.365243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fundamental limit on delay estimation using partially correlated speckle signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365243/","displayDocTitle":"A fundamental limit on delay estimation using partially correlated speckle signals","volume":"42","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4908324","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fundamental limit on delay estimation using partially correlated speckle signals","sourcePdf":"365243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075729S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"235","articleId":"365243","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":365245,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Epitaxial, high-acoustic quality 10-/spl mu/m-thick ZnO film layers were produced by rf-magnetron sputter deposition onto a (111)-oriented gold film (with a chromium adhesion layer) that was vacuum-evaporated onto a (0001) sapphire surface. We found that, in well-oriented growth of gold, it is important to control the chromium sublayer thickness (less than 5 nm). An array was constructed by photolithography with an appropriate etch. V-shaped grooves between adjacent elements were formed by using an anisotropic etchant (HCl and HNO/sub 3/-based) that preferentially etched the c-plane of ZnO. Typical array elements were 90 /spl mu/m wide, 3.2 mm long, and 10 /spl mu/m thick, and the pitch of an array was typically 100 /spl mu/m. Our fine uniform array resulted in uniform ultrasonic response of individual elements throughout the array. For a 32-element array, the ultrasound beam in the azimuth plane in water could be electronically focused in the 100 MHz range to obtain a half-amplitude width of 60 /spl mu/m at the focal depth, agreeing well with theoretical predictions. Besides the use demonstrated with this present transducer, piezoelectric thin films should also lead to fabrication of various other kinds of ultrasonic transducers that can operate at high frequencies and should provide opportunities for miniaturizing transducers and making integrated ultrasonic devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.365245","startPage":"316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/8368/00365245.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.365245","endPage":"324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 100-MHz ultrasonic transducer array using ZnO thin films","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"A 100-MHz ultrasonic transducer array using ZnO thin films","volume":"42","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4908326","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 100-MHz ultrasonic transducer array using ZnO thin films","sourcePdf":"365245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030836S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"35","articleId":"365245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365282,"authors":[{"name":"E.

New frequency-domain LMS adaptive schemes have been proposed. These algorithms essentially retain the attractive features of frequency-domain implementations, while requiring a processing delay considerably smaller than the length of the impulse response. The authors show that these algorithms can be seen as particular implementations of a more general scheme, the generalized multidelay filter (GMDF). Within this general class of algorithms, we focus on implementations based on the weighted overlap and add reconstruction algorithms; these variants, overlooked in previous contributions, provide an independent control of the overall processing delay and of the rate of update of the filter coefficients, allowing a trade-off between the computational complexity and the rate of convergence. We present a comprehensive analysis of the performance of this new scheme and to provide insight into the influence of impulse response segmentation on the behavior of the adaptive algorithm. Exact analytical expressions for the steady-state mean-square error are first derived. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of the algorithm to the optimal solution within finite variance are then obtained, and are translated into bounds for the stepsize parameter. Simulations are presented to support our analysis and to demonstrate the practical usefulness of the GMDF algorithm in applications where large impulse response has to be processed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.365282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8370","startPage":"14","endPage":"28","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8370/00365282.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The generalized multidelay adaptive filter: structure and convergence analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"The generalized multidelay adaptive filter: structure and convergence analysis","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4889117","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"43","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The generalized multidelay adaptive filter: structure and convergence analysis","sourcePdf":"00365282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049145S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"64","articleId":"365282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":365286,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

We present a new approach for tracking the signal subspace recursively. It is based on a novel interpretation of the signal subspace as the solution of a projection like unconstrained minimization problem. We show that recursive least squares techniques can be applied to solve this problem by making an appropriate projection approximation. The resulting algorithms have a computational complexity of O(nr) where n is the input vector dimension and r is the number of desired eigencomponents. Simulation results demonstrate that the tracking capability of these algorithms is similar to and in some cases more robust than the computationally expensive batch eigenvalue decomposition. Relations of the new algorithms to other subspace tracking methods and numerical issues are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.365290","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8370/00365290.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.365290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"95","endPage":"107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projection approximation subspace tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Projection approximation subspace tracking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365290/","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4889125","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projection approximation subspace tracking","sourcePdf":"00365290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039691S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"669","articleId":"365290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":365291,"authors":[{"name":"G.

For \"multifilters\" those coefficients are matrices. This gives a new block structure for the filter bank, and leads to multiple scaling functions and wavelets. Geronimo, Hardin, and Massopust (see J. Approx. Theory, vol.78, p.373-401, 1994) constructed two scaling functions that have extra properties not previously achieved. The functions /spl Phi//sub 1/ and /spl Phi//sub 2/ are symmetric (linear phase) and they have short support (two intervals or less), while their translates form an orthogonal family. For any single function /spl Phi/, apart from Haar's piecewise constants, those extra properties are known to be impossible. The novelty is to introduce 2/spl times/2 matrix coefficients while retaining orthogonality of the multiwavelets. This note derives the properties of /spl Phi//sub 1/ and /spl Phi//sub 2/ from the matrix dilation equation that they satisfy. Then our main step is to construct associated wavelets: two wavelets for two scaling functions. The properties were derived by Geronimo, Hardin, and Massopust from the iterated interpolation that led to /spl Phi/1 and /spl Phi//sub 2/. One pair of wavelets was found earlier by direct solution of the orthogonality conditions (using Mathematica). Our construction is in parallel with recent progress by Hardin and Geronimo, to develop the underlying algebra from the matrix coefficients in the dilation equation-in another language, to build the 4/spl times/4 paraunitary polyphase matrix in the filter bank. The short support opens new possibilities for applications of filters and wavelets near boundaries.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.365291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8370/00365291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.365291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8370","startPage":"108","endPage":"115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short wavelets and matrix dilation equations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Short wavelets and matrix dilation equations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4895187","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short wavelets and matrix dilation equations","sourcePdf":"00365291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038298S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"86","articleId":"365291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":365292,"authors":[{"name":"See-May Phoong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"See-May Phoong","id":"37266374400"},{"name":"P.P.

In this paper, we further generalize the result. We also derive the statistical coding gain for the generalized subband convolver. As an application, we derive a novel low sensitivity structure for FIR filters from the convolution theorem. We define and derive a deterministic coding gain of the subband convolver over direct convolution for a fixed wordlength implementation. This gain serves as a figure of merit for the low sensitivity structure. Several numerical examples are included to demonstrate the usefulness of these ideas. By using the generalized polyphase representation, we show that the subband convolvers, linear periodically time varying systems, and digital block filtering can be viewed in a unified manner. Furthermore, the scheme called IFIR filtering is shown to be a special case of the convolver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.365292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8370","startPage":"116","endPage":"133","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8370/00365292.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One- and two-level filter-bank convolvers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"One- and two-level filter-bank convolvers","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4895188","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"43","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One- and two-level filter-bank convolvers","sourcePdf":"00365292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065776S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"2","articleId":"365292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":365293,"authors":[{"name":"M.I.

More specifically, not only the root (pole and zero) locations but also the orders of the channel transfer functions are unknown. It is assumed that the channel orders may be overestimated. The proposed algorithm estimates the orders and root locations of the channel transfer functions, therefore it can also be used in multichannel system identification problems. The input signal is allowed to be nonstationary and the channel transfer functions may be a nonminimum phase as well as noncausal, hence the proposed algorithm is particularly suitable for applications such as dereverberation of speech signals recorded through multiple microphones.

The resulting sinusoidal multitaper spectral estimate is S/spl circ/(f)=(1/2K(N+1))/spl Sigmasub j=1sup K/|y(f+j/(2N+2))-y(f-j/(2N+2))|/sup 2/, where y(f) is the Fourier transform of the stationary time series, S(f) is the spectral density, and K is the number of tapers. For fixed j, the sinusoidal tapers converge to the minimum bias tapers like 1/N. Since the sinusoidal tapers have analytic expressions, no numerical eigenvalue decomposition is necessary. Both the minimum bias and sinusoidal tapers have no additional parameter for the spectral bandwidth. The bandwidth of the jth taper is simply 1/N centered about the frequencies (/spl plusmn/j)/(2N+2). Thus, the bandwidth of the multitaper spectral estimate can be adjusted locally by simply adding or deleting tapers. The band limited spectral concentration, /spl intsub -wsup w/|V(f)|/sup 2/df of both the minimum bias and sinusoidal tapers is very close to the optimal concentration achieved by the Slepian (1978) tapers. In contrast, the Slepian tapers can have the local bias, /spl intsub - 1/2 sup 1/2 /f/sup 2/|V(f)|/sup 2/df, much larger than of the minimum bias tapers and the sinusoidal tapers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.365298","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"188","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8370/00365298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.365298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum bias multiple taper spectral estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Frequency","Spectral analysis","Fourier transforms","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Discrete Fourier transforms","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple taper spectral estimation","multitaper spectral analysis","minimum bias tapers","sinusoidal taper","sinusoidal multitaper spectral estimate","Fourier transform","stationary time series","spectral density","spectral bandwidth","Slepian tapers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Minimum bias multiple taper spectral estimation","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4889128","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365298/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum bias multiple taper spectral estimation","sourcePdf":"00365298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051821S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"111","articleId":"365298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365301,"authors":[{"name":"J.-F.

However, experimentation shows that this 'noise insensitivity' is traded for increased variability of the parameter estimates. The main purpose of this contribution is to derive and work out closed-form expressions of the asymptotic covariance of MUSIC-like direction-of-arrival estimates based on two fourth-order cumulant matrices: the diagonal slice and the contracted quadricovariance. This is compared with the standard covariance-based MUSIC estimate establishing on a rational basis the domain of applicability of higher order statistics for DOA estimation. In particular, the actual impact of the noise variance and of the dynamic range of the sources is investigated. This asymptotic performance analysis is achieved within a general framework, which we believe to be of general interest.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.365301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8370/00365301.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.365301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic performance analysis of direction-finding algorithms based on fourth-order cumulants","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365301/","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic performance analysis of direction-finding algorithms based on fourth-order cumulants","volume":"43","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4889131","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic performance analysis of direction-finding algorithms based on fourth-order cumulants","sourcePdf":"00365301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045156S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"60","articleId":"365301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":365303,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Practical cases where m>50 and L>100 are not uncommon. When the individual sensors of an array are closely spaced, the temporal and spatial correlation of the resulting vector noise process may be modeled in a separable fashion. In this case, the noise covariance block matrix attains a special structure where all block entries are just weighted versions of each other. It is shown that in this case, the complexity of the detector design can be reduced drastically by a factor of mL compared to a conventional multichannel matched filter design procedure. It is further shown that the separable vector noise model facilitates a complete exploitation of the rank properties of noise and data matrices. A constructive procedure for the design of \"low-rank\" detectors in the multichannel case is derived. These detectors consist of two consecutive blocks: a data and noise dependent \"compression\" stage, which maps the significant signal energy into a subspace of minimal dimension, followed by a minimal set of independent matched filters, which point in the subspace directions in which the signal is much stronger than the noise. This low-rank detector concept enables discrimination with little or no performance penalty at a minimal computational cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.365303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8370/00365303.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.365303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8370","startPage":"233","endPage":"242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-rank detection of multichannel Gaussian signals using block matrix approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-rank detection of multichannel Gaussian signals using block matrix approximation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365303/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4889133","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-rank detection of multichannel Gaussian signals using block matrix approximation","sourcePdf":"00365303.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02946S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","articleId":"365303","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365304,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Group theoretic concepts are used to formulate a flexible computational strategy that hybrids the reduced transform algorithm (RTA) with the Good-Thomas factorization and can deal efficiently with non-power-of-two sizes without resorting to zero-padding. The RTA algorithm is employed not as a data processing but rather as a bookkeeping tool in order to decompose the problem into many smaller size subproblems (lines) that can be solved independently by the processors. Implementation issues on an Intel iPSC/i860 hypercube are discussed and timing results for large 2D and 3D DFTs with index sets in Z/MP/spl times/Z/KP and Z/N/spl times/Z/MP/spl times/Z/KP respectively are provided, where N, M, K are powers-of-two and P is a small prime number such as 3, 5, or 7. The nonoptimized realizations of the new hybrid RTA approach are shown to outperform by as much as 70% the optimized assembly coded realizations of the traditional row-column method on the iPSC/860.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8370/00365307.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"285","doi":"10.1109/78.365307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.365307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach for computing multidimensional DFT's on parallel machines and its implementation on the iPSC/860 hypercube","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365307/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"A new approach for computing multidimensional DFT's on parallel machines and its implementation on the iPSC/860 hypercube","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4889137","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach for computing multidimensional DFT's on parallel machines and its implementation on the iPSC/860 hypercube","sourcePdf":"00365307.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053921S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","articleId":"365307","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":365308,"authors":[{"name":"D.Z.

First, we reformulate an N-point DCT or IDCT algorithm into a rotation formulation which makes it suitable for CORDIC processor implementation. We then propose to use a pipelined CORDIC processor as the basic building block to construct l-D and 2-D systolic-type processor arrays to speed up the DCT and IDCT computation. Due to the proposed novel rotation formulation, we achieve 100% processor utilization in both 1-D and 2-D configurations. Furthermore, we show that for the 2-D configurations, the same data processing throughput rate ran be maintained as long as the processor array dimensions are increased linearly with N. Neither the algorithm formulation or the array configuration need to be modified. Hence, the proposed parallel architecture is scalable to the problem size.

Data are clocked into a combinational circuit with a clock period smaller than the latency of the combinational block. To achieve the minimal period, collisions among waves must be avoided by balancing the delay paths from inputs to all intermediate nodes and outputs. Process variation and environmental influences have also to be taken into account in the design. While previous research has explored wave-pipelining of ECL and static CMOS circuits, we concentrate on CMOS domino circuits because of their compact layouts and shorter delay time. A timing model and constraints are given for deriving the minimal period. Special partitioning and delay assignment problems are discussed. Process variation is modeled by characterizing the current drive capabilities of N and P devices. A test chip has been designed, fabricated, and tested which uses a novel form of domino-logic to implement a wave-domino multiplier, sum of product trees, and a parity checker.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.365347","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/8371/00365347.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.365347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","startPage":"78","endPage":"91","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wave-domino logic: theory and applications","volume":"42","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4901985","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wave-domino logic: theory and applications","sourcePdf":"00365347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045301S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"13","articleId":"365347","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":365348,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

We provide a new mean-square analysis of this algorithm that accounts for the correlations between successive data vectors in the data matrix X/sub k/. Using our analysis, we show that for both correlated and i.i.d. input data channels, the multiple-error LMS algorithm performs uniformly worse than the single-channel LMS algorithm for a given amount of data consumed. We also derive simple step size bounds to guarantee mean-square convergence of the multiple-error and block LMS adaptive algorithms for our correlated data model.

The individual Gaussian components of a GMM are shown to represent some general speaker-dependent spectral shapes that are effective for modeling speaker identity. The focus of this work is on applications which require high identification rates using short utterance from unconstrained conversational speech and robustness to degradations produced by transmission over a telephone channel. A complete experimental evaluation of the Gaussian mixture speaker model is conducted on a 49 speaker, conversational telephone speech database. The experiments examine algorithmic issues (initialization, variance limiting, model order selection), spectral variability robustness techniques, large population performance, and comparisons to other speaker modeling techniques (uni-modal Gaussian, VQ codebook, tied Gaussian mixture, and radial basis functions). The Gaussian mixture speaker model attains 96.8% identification accuracy using 5 second clean speech utterances and 80.8% accuracy using 15 second telephone speech utterances with a 49 speaker population and is shown to outperform the other speaker modeling techniques on an identical 16 speaker telephone speech task.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4857073","volume":"3","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust text-independent speaker identification using Gaussian mixture speaker models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust text-independent speaker identification using Gaussian mixture speaker models","sourcePdf":"00365379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120367S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"1335","articleId":"365379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":365380,"authors":[{"name":"Juin-Hwey Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA","Coding Research Department, AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Juin-Hwey Chen","id":"37351181400"},{"name":"A.

The postfilter consists of a long-term postfilter section in cascade with a short-term postfilter section and includes spectral tilt compensation and automatic gain control. The long-term section emphasizes pitch harmonics and attenuates the spectral valleys between pitch harmonics. The short-term section, on the other hand, emphasizes speech formants and attenuates the spectral valleys between formants. Both filter sections have poles and zeros. Unlike earlier postfilters that often introduced a substantial amount of muffling to the output speech, our postfilter significantly reduces this effect by minimizing the spectral tilt in its frequency response. As a result, this postfilter achieves noticeable noise reduction while introducing only minimal distortion in speech. The complexity of the postfilter is quite low. Variations of this postfilter are now being used in several national and international speech coding standards. This paper presents for the first time a complete description of our original postfiltering algorithm and the underlying ideas that motivated its development.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365380/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4857072","volume":"3","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive postfiltering for quality enhancement of coded speech","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive postfiltering for quality enhancement of coded speech","sourcePdf":"00365380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108231S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"91","articleId":"365380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365381,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It functions by recognizing the person's words, interpreting the sequence of words to obtain a meaning in terms of the application, and providing an appropriate response back to the user. Potential applications of spoken language systems range from simple tasks, such as retrieving information from an existing database (traffic reports, airline schedules), to interactive problem solving tasks involving complex planning and reasoning (travel planning, traffic routing), to support for multilingual interactions. We examine eight key areas in which basic research is needed to produce spoken language systems: (1) robust speech recognition; (2) automatic training and adaptation; (3) spontaneous speech; (4) dialogue models; (5) natural language response generation; (6) speech synthesis and speech generation; (7) multilingual systems; and (8) interactive multimodal systems. In each area, we identify key research challenges, the infrastructure needed to support research, and the expected benefits. We conclude by reviewing the need for multidisciplinary research, for development of shared corpora and related resources, for computational support and far rapid communication among researchers. The successful development of this technology will increase accessibility of computers to a wide range of users, will facilitate multinational communication and trade, and will create new research specialties and jobs in this rapidly expanding area.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4857067","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"The challenge of spoken language systems: Research directions for the nineties","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The challenge of spoken language systems: Research directions for the nineties","sourcePdf":"00365385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11825S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"57","articleId":"365385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365415,"authors":[{"name":"I.

This paper deals with the optimization of the virtual paths system from a bandwidth utilization perspective. While previous research on VP management has basically assumed that bandwidth in ATM networks is unlimited, emerging technologies and applications are changing this premise. In many networks, such as wireless, bandwidth is always at a premium. In wired networks, with increasing user access speeds, less than a dozen of broadband connections can saturate even a Gigabit link. We present an efficient algorithm that finds a system of VP routes for a given set of VP terminators and VP capacity demands. This solution is motivated by the need to minimize the load, or reduce congestion, generated by the VP's on individual links. A nontrivial performance guarantee is proven for the quality of the proposed solution and numerical results show that the proposed solution carries the potential for a near optimal allocation of VPs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/90.365415","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/8374/00365415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.365415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8374","startPage":"581","endPage":"587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing the system of virtual paths","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the system of virtual paths","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4857064","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the system of virtual paths","sourcePdf":"00365415.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045023S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"8374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"33","articleId":"365415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":365453,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

Solutions that involve algorithmic, structural or physical transformations are sought. The focus is on developing low-power circuits without affecting too much the performance (area, latency, period). For CMOS circuits most power is dissipated as dynamic power for charging and discharging node capacitances. This is why many promising results in low-power design are obtained by minimizing the number of transitions inside the CMOS circuit. While it is generally accepted that because of the large capacitances involved much of the power dissipated by an IC is at the I/O little has been specifically done for decreasing the I/O power dissipation. We propose the bus-invert method of coding the I/O which lowers the bus activity and thus decreases the I/O peak power dissipation by 50% and the I/O average power dissipation by up to 25%. The method is general but applies best for dealing with buses. This is fortunate because buses are indeed most likely to have very large capacitances associated with them and consequently dissipate a lot of power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.365453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/8376/00365453.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.365453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bus-invert coding for low-power I/O","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"Bus-invert coding for low-power I/O","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365453/","publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4915490","volume":"3","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bus-invert coding for low-power I/O","sourcePdf":"00365453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066572S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"550","articleId":"365453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":365454,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Unfortunately, the obtained algorithms are of O(n/sup 2/) complexity which is not practical for real purposes.

Circuit speed, power dissipation, physical area, and system reliability are the four performance criteria of concern in tapered buffers, and each places a separate, often conflicting, constraint on the design of a tapered buffer. Enhanced short-channel tapered buffer design equations are presented for propagation delay and power dissipation, as well as a new split-capacitor model of hot-carrier reliability of tapered buffers and a two-component physical area model. Each performance criterion is individually investigated and analyzed with respect to the number of stages and tapering factor, and the interaction of the four criteria is examined to develop both a qualitative and a quantitative understanding of the various design tradeoffs. The creation of process dependent look-up tables for optimal buffer design is described, and a methodology to apply these look-up tables to application-specific tapered buffers for both unconstrained and constrained systems is developed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365457/","volume":"3","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4915494","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A unified design methodology for CMOS tapered buffers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified design methodology for CMOS tapered buffers","sourcePdf":"00365457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081241S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"70","articleId":"365457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365460,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Emphasis is placed on the logic module architecture and channel segmentation for the FPGAs targeted for application areas related to digital signal processing (DSP). The proposed logic module architecture is well-suited for efficient implementation of frequently used logic functions in the DSP application area. This is mainly because it is possible to implement most of these functions using one logic module, which results in a reduction in both the net lengths and the number of antifuses used. The performance improvements are achieved by customizing the logic module architecture and the programmable interconnect to suit the requirements of DSP applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An architecture for a DSP field-programmable gate array","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/92.365460","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/8376/00365460.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.365460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8376","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365460/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"An architecture for a DSP field-programmable gate array","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4915497","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architecture for a DSP field-programmable gate array","sourcePdf":"00365460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027758S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","articleId":"365460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":365492,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

Permanent damage to wirebonds would occur if the wires could not dissipate the energy, due to excessive current, delivered through the wires. This current overstress damage is recognized as fused bond wires. In this paper, the simplified model developed by Loh (1983) has been used to predict the fusing time and the fusing current of aluminum and gold wires as functions of wire length and wire diameter. In addition, the equation obtained by Loh has been put into more convenient form by eliminating the dependence on the bond wire diameter. Results from both approaches have been presented in graphical form so that package design engineers would be able to estimate the fusing current for a given fusing time. Conversely, the fusing time for a given current passing through the wires could be easily obtained from the design graphs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365510/","volume":"18","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4898240","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of aluminum and gold bond wire fusing current and fusing time","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of aluminum and gold bond wire fusing current and fusing time","sourcePdf":"00365510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033873S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"12","articleId":"365510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":365516,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

Second, very high order adaptive filters are computationally expensive. One problem with adaptive filtering in subbands is the slow, asymptotic convergence associated with oversampled systems. Increasing the bandwidth of analysis filters relative to the synthesis filters is proposed to reduce the slow asymptotic convergence.

In this extended abstract, we discuss the outline of the free flow control algorithm of the Advanced distributed Ramp Metering System, ARMS, for the real-time control of freeway ramp metering systems. ARMS consists of three levels of control algorithms integrated together for free flow control, breakdown prediction, and congestion resolution. Based on a free flow traffic model, the free flow control algorithm takes into account of the congestion risk when it tries to maximize the traffic throughput. The breakdown prediction algorithm can make prediction on the possibility of imminent congestion caused by flow breakdown, and the congestion resolution algorithm is to resolve the congestion if it actually occurs. The ARMS has a modular architecture so that it can be scaled for incremental implementation. To control freeway traffic, a system wide optimization objective is first defined for a target area. Then, ramp metering decisions are made by the entrance ramp controllers within the target area after their traffic data are exchanged.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arm","Traffic control","Control systems","Electric breakdown","Detectors","Road transportation","Computer science","Real time systems","Throughput","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road traffic","traffic control","distributed processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced distributed ramp metering system","ARMS","freeway capacity","traffic flow","freeway entrance ramps","free flow traffic model","congestion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WPDRTS.1994.365655","publicationTitle":"Second Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Real-Time Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Second Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Real-Time Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/2954/8383/00365655.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPDRTS.1994.365655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The advanced distributed ramp metering system (ARMS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The advanced distributed ramp metering system (ARMS)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365655/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4818733","conferenceDate":"28-29 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Apr 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The advanced distributed ramp metering system (ARMS)","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"00365655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047445S","chronDate":"28-29 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2954","citationCount":"2","articleId":"365655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":365679,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This scheme applied to the AKS network yields a depth 5 periodic comparator network that sorts in time O(log/sup 2/ n). More practical networks with runtime O(log/sup 3/ n) can be obtained from Batcher's networks.

A popular and practical method of scheduling this kind of dynamic MIMD-style computation is \"work stealing,\" in which processors needing work steal computational threads from other processors. In this paper, we give the first provably good work-stealing scheduler for multithreaded computations with dependencies. Specifically, our analysis shows that the expected time T/sub P/ to execute a fully strict computation on P processors using our work-stealing scheduler is T/sub P/=O(T/sub 1//P+T/sub /spl infin//), where T/sub 1/ is the minimum serial execution time of the multithreaded computation and T/sub /spl infin// is the minimum execution time with an infinite number of processors. Moreover, the space S/sub P/ required by the execution satisfies S/sub P//spl les/S/sub 1/P. We also show that the expected total communication of the algorithm is at most O(T/sub /spl infin//S/sub max/P), where S/sub max/ is the size of the largest activation record of any thread, thereby justifying the folk wisdom that work-stealing schedulers are more communication efficient than their work-sharing counterparts. All three of these bounds are existentially optimal to within a constant factor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1994.365680","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel2/2955/8384/00365680.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1994.365680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384","startPage":"356","endPage":"368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling multithreaded computations by work stealing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=365680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling multithreaded computations by work stealing","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365680/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4865040","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling multithreaded computations by work stealing","confLoc":"Santa Fe, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00365680.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057777S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2955","citationCount":"191","articleId":"365680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":365687,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Koller and N. Megiddo (1993) introduced the paradigm of constructing compact distributions that satisfy a given set of constraints, and showed how it can be used to efficiently derandomize certain types of algorithm. In this paper, we significantly extend their results in two ways. First, we show how their approach can be applied to deal with more general expectation constraints. More importantly, we provide the first parallel (/spl Nscr//spl Cscr/) algorithm for constructing a compact distribution that satisfies the constraints up to a small relative error. This algorithm deals with constraints over any event that can be verified by finite automata, including all independence constraints as well as constraints over events relating to the parity or sum of a certain set of variables. Our construction relies on a new and independently interesting parallel algorithm for converting a solution to a linear system into an almost basic approximate solution to the same system. We use these techniques in the first /spl Nscr//spl Cscr/ derandomization of an algorithm for constructing large independent sets in d-uniform hypergraphs for arbitrary d. We also show how the linear programming perspective suggests new proof techniques which might be useful in general probabilistic analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1994.365689","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel2/2955/8384/00365689.pdf","startPage":"252","endPage":"263","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1994.365689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"(De)randomized construction of small sample spaces in /spl Nscr//spl Cscr/","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"(De)randomized construction of small sample spaces in /spl Nscr//spl Cscr/","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4865031","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/365689/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"(De)randomized construction of small sample spaces in /spl Nscr//spl Cscr/","confLoc":"Santa Fe, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00365689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05652S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2955","citationCount":"2","articleId":"365689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":365692,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Quorum systems have been used for a number of applications in the area of distributed systems. We investigate the load, capacity and availability of quorum systems. We present four novel constructions of quorum system, all featuring optimal or near optimal load, and high availability. These desirable properties of the constructions translate into improvements of any protocol using them: a low work load on the processors and a high resilience to processor failures. The best construction, based on paths in a grid, has a load of O(1//spl radic/n), and a failure probability of exp(-O(/spl radic/n)) when the elements fail with probability p< 1/2 . Moreover, even in the presence of faults, with exponentially high probability the load of this system is still O(1//spl radic/n).

Besides giving the best known approximation ratio in terms of n, this marks the first non-trivial approximation result as a function of the maximum degree /spl Delta/. This result can be generalized to k-colorable graphs to obtain a coloring using min {O/spl tilde/(/spl Delta//sup 1-2/k/), O/spl tilde/(n/sup 1-3/(k+1/))} colors. Our results are inspired by the recent work of Goemans and Williamson who used an algorithm for semidefinite optimization problems, which generalize linear programs, to obtain improved approximations for the MAX CUT and MAX 2-SAT problems.

The processing gain obtained with the new algorithm is compared with figures obtained when only the largest line in the mainlobe is used.

The wavelet transform, which produces a representation which is intermediate between a spatial and a frequency representation, can be viewed as a multiresolution decomposition technique. The lack of shift invariance of the wavelet transform restricts its applicability in stereo image matching. An hierarchical image matching technique is described which can use a Gaussian or a wavelet image pyramid. The results of using the two image pyramids are compared to evaluate the applicability of the wavelet transform.

Beyond obtaining a suitable sensing element, stringent demands on accuracy has led to continued developments in the improvement of compensation and calibration techniques. Typically, signal conditioning would attempt to minimise the effects of zero offsets and nonlinear temperature and pressure effects. Conventional analogue compensation methods have been phased out in favour of digital methods which provide a lower cost solution due to the reduction in test and calibration time. However, digital methods currently employed have been deemed to be insufficiently accurate or highly memory intensive, thus there is a need for an alternative approach that provides a compromise between the above. The use of neural networks may offer this compromise, with the added advantage of possessing certain characteristics that could contribute to the development of a smart transducer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1994.366002","startPage":"633","endPage":"640","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/2959/8388/00366002.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.1994.366002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural networks for sensor performance improvement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Temperature sensors","Transducers","Calibration","Polynomials","Intelligent sensors","Pressure effects","Random access memory","Surface fitting","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","intelligent sensors","compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","sensors","performance improvement","smart transducer","multilayer perceptron","compensation module","radial basis function","genetic algorithms","hysteresis effects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks for sensor performance improvement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4864382","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks for sensor performance improvement","confLoc":"Ermioni, Greece","sourcePdf":"00366002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028999S","chronDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2959","citationCount":"3","articleId":"366002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":366005,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Although the idea of employing neural net based receivers for interference channels is not new, the novel technical contributions of the authors' paper can be summarized as follows. (i) Propose, analyze and evaluate a training algorithm for Nyquist filtered single- and multi-amplitude signals which is based upon a novel non-uniform signal sampling technique. (ii) Propose and evaluate neural net structures employing a novel non-linear activation function for the detection of multi-amplitude signals. (iii) Present novel bit error rate (BER) performance evaluation results for coherent and noncoherent single- and multi-amplitude signals, including binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), operated in generalized CCI and ACI channels. The authors' research has demonstrated that, as compared to more conventional detection techniques, the proposed neural net receivers provide significant performance improvements in CCI and/or ACI channels. Their tolerance for inaccuracies in symbol timing synchronization also makes them good candidates for practical modem implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1994.366012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.1994.366012","startPage":"535","endPage":"544","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/2959/8388/00366012.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-net based receiver structures for single- and multi-amplitude signals in interference channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural-net based receiver structures for single- and multi-amplitude signals in interference channels","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4864372","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366012/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-net based receiver structures for single- and multi-amplitude signals in interference channels","confLoc":"Ermioni, Greece","sourcePdf":"00366012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031168S","chronDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2959","citationCount":"3","articleId":"366012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":366013,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The performance of the method was measured using the European ST-T database. In particular the performance was measured in terms of beat-by-beat ischemia detection and in terms of ischemic episodes detection. Aggregate statistics for the description of the detector performance were used due to the small number of events. The algorithm used to train the NN was an adaptive backpropagation (BP) algorithm. This algorithm reduces dramatically training time (10-fold decrease in our case) when compared to the classical BP algorithm. The resulting NN is capable of detecting ischemia independently of the lead used. It was found that the average ischemia episode sensitivity is 88.62% while the average ischemia sensitivity is 72.22%. This drop in ischemia sensitivity could be attributed to the diverse statistical properties of the ECGs within the same patient. The results show that NN can be used in ECG processing in cases where fast and reliable detection of ischemic episodes is desired as in the case of critical care units (CCUs).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366014/","accessionNumber":"4864370","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Use of neural networks in detection of ischemic episodes from ECG leads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of neural networks in detection of ischemic episodes from ECG leads","confLoc":"Ermioni, Greece","sourcePdf":"00366014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125376S","chronDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2959","citationCount":"9","articleId":"366014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":366015,"authors":[{"name":"C.

For training these tied mixture density HMMs, modified versions of the Viterbi training and learning vector quantisation (LVQ) based corrective tuning are described. The initialization of the mean vectors of the mixture Gaussians is performed by first composing small self-organising maps representing each phoneme and then combining them to a single large codebook to be trained by LVQ. The experiments on the proposed training methods are accomplished using a speech recognition system for Finnish phoneme sequences. Comparing to the corresponding continuous density and semi-continuous HMMs regarding the number of parameters, the recognition time and the average error rate, the performance of the phoneme-wise tied mixture HMMs is superior.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1994.366023","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/2959/8388/00366023.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.1994.366023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid training method for tied mixture density hidden Markov models using learning vector quantization and Viterbi estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=366023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366023/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid training method for tied mixture density hidden Markov models using learning vector quantization and Viterbi estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4864361","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid training method for tied mixture density hidden Markov models using learning vector quantization and Viterbi estimation","confLoc":"Ermioni, Greece","sourcePdf":"00366023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039691S","chronDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2959","citationCount":"7","articleId":"366023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":366025,"authors":[{"name":"G.G.

(1992). The design accepts and inputs signal data to a noise/target classifier which uses spectral estimation techniques to distinguish noise from real targets. In that design, the NN is used to calculate the coefficients of an auto regressive linear predictive filter. The current evolution of that design invokes the use of Lagrange multiplier methods to incorporate known characteristics of the noise vs. signal. A (linear) Hopfield NN is used to perform the constrained optimization to solve for the filter coefficients. This algorithm has been demonstrated on real stochastic data. The filter resulting from this process succeeds in reducing the noise, whose structure was learned by the NN. Not only did this approach reduce structured noise without target attenuation or the addition of a 'ghost' signal, but it also lowered the base level of the resultant signal significantly. The overall concept has been tested and validated using real data on a workstation and the hardware NN implementation has been validated. This concept has been tested on the AAC Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) Neural Network Processor (NNP) hardware. Each processor runs at 140 million connections/sec with 8 K neurons. An expanded version of the system performs a total of a billion plus connections/sec. Unlike classical SIMD NN architectures, which are really general purpose array processors, this MIMD system architecture was custom designed for NN applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1994.366025","pdfPath":"/iel2/2959/8388/00366025.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"460","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.1994.366025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware neural network implementation of tracking system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Hardware neural network implementation of tracking system","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4858565","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware neural network implementation of tracking system","confLoc":"Ermioni, Greece","sourcePdf":"00366025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0308S","chronDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2959","citationCount":"2","articleId":"366025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":366027,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

Reliable spotting of CV segments in continuous speech can significantly improve the performance of a speech-to text system. Formant transitions in the transition region of a CV segment provide important clues for recognition of stop consonant CV segments. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain a suitable parametric representation of speech data in the transition region of a CV segment to be used as input to a classifier. We discuss the choice of formants as features representing the CV segments and the fuzzy nature of these features. The details of a fuzzy neural network classifier based on the ideas given by Pal-Mitra (1992) are discussed. Methods for fuzzification of formant trajectories are presented.

This network structure improves the ERLE performance by 10 dB at low to medium loudspeaker volumes compared to a NLMS echo canceller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1994.366042","pdfPath":"/iel2/2959/8388/00366042.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"258","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.1994.366042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic echo cancellation for hands-free telephony using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic echo cancellation for hands-free telephony using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4858548","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic echo cancellation for hands-free telephony using neural networks","confLoc":"Ermioni, Greece","sourcePdf":"00366042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034531S","chronDate":"6-8 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2959","citationCount":"5","articleId":"366042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":366049,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A regularized model may be characterized by an effective number of weights (parameters); however, it is demonstrated that no simple definition is possible. A novel estimator of the average generalization error (called FPER) is suggested and compared to the final prediction error (FPE) and generalized prediction error (GPE) estimators.

The performance of an EM algorithm highly depends on assumptions made about the probability density function (commonly, the multivariate Gaussian) of the multivariate data. When the EM algorithm is used for classification applications, it is commonly done by replacing the missing values based on the estimated probability density function of the same class for getting the maximum likelihood labeling without jointly considering the discrimination among classes. In this paper, the authors propose an EM procedure based on a neural network inversion technique for improving the training accuracy using incomplete data sets and the classification accuracy in testing new incomplete data.

It is shown that the PBPO decision rule is a likelihood ratio test for statistically independent observations. The threshold of the test is shown to be a function of the decision input vector of the detector under consideration. This unified approach is used to obtain the PBPO decision rules of decentralized detection systems with various topologies. Various results in the literature are verified. In addition, the PBPO decision rules for a decentralized detection system with peer communication are presented. Numerical examples are presented for illustration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.366288","startPage":"9","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.366288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/8392/00366288.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified approach to the design of decentralized detection systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366288/","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to the design of decentralized detection systems","volume":"31","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4907345","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to the design of decentralized detection systems","sourcePdf":"00366288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052648S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"40","articleId":"366288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":366294,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The NEC is an attractive coding technique which employs differential detectors with more than one symbol delay elements and which does not introduce any redundancy as other coding schemes do. As typical for aeronautical satellite communications, a Rician fading channel with Gaussian power spectrum has been considered. Unlike the additive, uncorrelated from symbol to symbol interference such as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) or static cochannel interference (CCI) which has been investigated in the past, analysis of the performance in a fading channel is much more difficult. The difficulty arises from the multiplicative and correlative nature of the fading interference. Bit error rate (BER) performance evaluation results have been obtained by means of computer simulation for various channel conditions, including different values of the K-factor and the fading B/sub D/T. These results have indicated that considerable performance gains as compared with conventional differentially detected systems are achieved for high values of K and for very fast fading. Both of these conditions are encountered in typical aeronautical communication systems. Wherever possible, heuristic explanations of the trend of the obtained BER performance evaluation results are also given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonredundant error correction DQPSK for the aeronautical-satellite channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.366301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/8392/00366301.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.366301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8392","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=366301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Nonredundant error correction DQPSK for the aeronautical-satellite channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4907358","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonredundant error correction DQPSK for the aeronautical-satellite channel","sourcePdf":"00366301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045127S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"2","articleId":"366301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":366309,"authors":[{"name":"H.C.

P/sub D/ and P/sub G/ are computed as a function of the false alarm probability P/sub F/ with no contamination, the number of input channels, the number of independent samples-per-channel, the matched filtered output signal-to-noise (S/N) power ratio, and the S/N power ratio of the contaminating desired signal. It is shown that both P/sub D/ and P/sub G/ decrease with increasing levels of contamination. The P/sub G/ performance is is almost identical for the GLRT and MLAD. The P/sub D/ performance shows similar relative performance trends. Significantly, it is shown that the ghosting probability does not exceed P/sub F/ in the presence of contamination.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.366312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/8392/00366312.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.366312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of signal contamination on two adaptive detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=366312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366312/","displayDocTitle":"The effects of signal contamination on two adaptive detectors","volume":"31","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4907369","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of signal contamination on two adaptive detectors","sourcePdf":"00366312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045856S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"40","articleId":"366312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":366320,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

In general this is a \"one-pass\" procedure, with data transmission from the sensors (or subordinate decision makers) to the fusion center. There have been treatments of multipass schemes, but usually the approach has been to update the local decisions based on the previous fused decision. We explore the use of feedback (of all sensor decisions to all sensors) and successive retesting and rebroadcasting of the updated decisions until a common decision or consensus is reached, an operation we call parley due to its similarity to the process of discussion and negotiation by a team of human decision makers. We consider two modes of operation of such a network. In the first, all sensors are as correct as possible at all times. We see that this network is fast in reaching consensus, but not particularly as \"correct\" as it could be. Under the second scheme, we observe that via feedback it is possible for the network to make an optimum decision-this may, of course, require several rounds of parley. Of particular interest is that under both schemes a consensus always occurs-the sensors never \"agree to disagree\".<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.366326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8392","startPage":"447","endPage":"457","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/8392/00366326.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parley as an approach to distributed detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parley as an approach to distributed detection","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4899559","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parley as an approach to distributed detection","sourcePdf":"00366326.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154314S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"42","articleId":"366326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":366332,"authors":[{"name":"I.J.

Presented in the paper is a generalized diffraction synthesis technique for single- and dual-reflector antennas fed by either a single feed or an array feed. High versatility and accuracy are achieved by combining optimization procedures and diffraction analysis such as physical optics (PO) and physical theory of diffraction (PTD). With this technique, one may simultaneously shape the reflector surfaces and adjust the positions, orientations, and excitations of an arbitrarily configured array feed to produce the specified radiation characteristics such as high directivity, contoured patterns, and low sidelobe levels, etc. The shaped reflectors are represented by a set of orthogonal global expansion functions (the Jacobi-Fourier expansion), and are characterized by smooth surfaces, well-defined (superquadric) circumferences, and continuous surface derivatives. The sample applications of contoured beam antenna designs and reflector surface distortion compensation are given to illustrate the effectiveness of this diffraction synthesis technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized diffraction synthesis technique for high performance reflector antennas","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.366348","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8393/00366348.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.366348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=366348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366348/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"A generalized diffraction synthesis technique for high performance reflector antennas","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4887580","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized diffraction synthesis technique for high performance reflector antennas","sourcePdf":"00366348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047786S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"132","articleId":"366348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":366358,"authors":[{"name":"E.

However, with increasing frequency both computation time and memory requirement often exceed available computer capacities. Therefore a current based hybrid method combining the MM with the physical optics (PO) approximation suitable for three-dimensional perfectly conducting bodies is proposed in this paper. The hybrid formulation allows a substantial reduction of computation time and memory requirement, while the results are in reasonable agreement with those based on an application of the MM alone. Further improvement can be achieved for flat polygonal parts of the scattering body by a heuristic modification of the PO current density taking into account the effects of edges. As opposed to the physical theory of diffraction (PTD), no additional electric and magnetic line currents along the edges are necessary.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.366378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8394/00366378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.366378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8394","startPage":"162","endPage":"169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved PO-MM hybrid formulation for scattering from three-dimensional perfectly conducting bodies of arbitrary shape","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=366378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved PO-MM hybrid formulation for scattering from three-dimensional perfectly conducting bodies of arbitrary shape","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4899513","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved PO-MM hybrid formulation for scattering from three-dimensional perfectly conducting bodies of arbitrary shape","sourcePdf":"00366378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040919S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"182","articleId":"366378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":366382,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

In our formulation, the original and rescaled signals are each represented by an interpolating polynomial spline of degree n with step size one and /spl Delta/, respectively. The change of scale is achieved by determining the spline with step size /spl Delta/ that provides the closest approximation of the original signal in the L/sub 2/-norm. We show that this approximation can be computed in three steps: (i) a digital prefilter that provides the B-spline coefficients of the input signal, (ii) a resampling using an expansion formula with a modified sampling kernel that depends explicitly on /spl Delta/, and (iii) a digital postfilter that maps the result back into the signal domain. We provide explicit formulas for n=0, 1, and 3 and propose solutions for the efficient implementation of these algorithms. We consider image processing examples and show that the present method compares favorably with standard interpolation techniques. Finally, we discuss some properties of this approach and its connection with the classical technique of bandlimiting a signal, which provides the asymptotic limit of our algorithm as the order of the spline tends to infinity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8398/00366474.pdf","doi":"10.1109/83.366474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.366474","startPage":"247","endPage":"258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enlargement or reduction of digital images with minimum loss of information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366474/","displayDocTitle":"Enlargement or reduction of digital images with minimum loss of information","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4909172","pubMedId":"18289976","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enlargement or reduction of digital images with minimum loss of information","sourcePdf":"00366474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032249S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"147","articleId":"366474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":366477,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The algorithm is based on a source model emphasizing the visual integrity of detected edges and incorporates a novel edge fitting operator that has been developed for this application. A small neighborhood about each pixel in the low-resolution image is first mapped to a best-fit continuous space step edge. The bilevel approximation serves as a local template on which the higher resolution sampling grid can then be superimposed (where disputed values in regions of local window overlap are averaged to smooth errors). The result is an image of increased resolution with noticeably sharper edges and, in all tried cases, lower mean-squared reconstruction error than that produced by linear techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.366477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8398/00366477.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.366477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subpixel edge localization and the interpolation of still images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=366477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366477/","displayDocTitle":"Subpixel edge localization and the interpolation of still images","volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4909175","pubMedId":"18289979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subpixel edge localization and the interpolation of still images","sourcePdf":"00366477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043796S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"344","articleId":"366477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":366478,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Since these images can be quite large, they invite efficient source coding schemes for reducing storage and transmission requirements. Because multispectral images include a third (spectral) dimension with nonstationary behavior, these multilayer data sets require specialized coding techniques. The authors develop both a theory and specific methods for performing optimal transform coding of multispectral images. The theory is based on the assumption that a multispectral image may be modeled as a set of jointly stationary Gaussian random processes. Therefore, the methods may be applied to any multilayer data set which meets this assumption. Although the authors do not assume the autocorrelation has a separable form, they show that the optimal transform for coding has a partially separable structure. In particular, they prove that a coding scheme consisting of a frequency transform within each layer followed by a separate KL transform across the layers at each spatial frequency is asymptotically optimal as the block size becomes large. Two simplifications of this method are also shown to be asymptotically optimal if the data can be assumed to satisfy additional constraints. The proposed coding techniques are then implemented using subband filtering methods, and the various algorithms are tested on multispectral images to determine their relative performance characteristics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8398/00366478.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.366478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.366478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8398","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=366478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal transforms for multispectral and multilayer image coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonhomogeneous media","Image coding","Multispectral imaging","Image storage","Frequency","Optical filters","Source coding","Transform coding","Random processes","Autocorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source coding","transform coding","random processes","Gaussian processes","image coding","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multispectral image coding","multilayer image coding","source coding scheme","optimal transform coding","jointly stationary Gaussian random processes","autocorrelation","partially separable structure","frequency transform","KL transform","spatial frequency","block size","subband filtering","relative performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimal transforms for multispectral and multilayer image coding","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4901975","pubMedId":"18289980","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal transforms for multispectral and multilayer image coding","sourcePdf":"00366478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086737S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"19","articleId":"366478","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":366480,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Center for Information Processing Research Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hui Li","id":"37087259111"},{"name":"B.S.

One challenging problem in this area is the registration of multispectral/multisensor images. In general, such images have different gray level characteristics, and simple techniques such as those based on area correlations cannot be applied directly. On the other hand, contours representing region boundaries are preserved in most cases. The authors present two contour-based methods which use region boundaries and other strong edges as matching primitives. The first contour matching algorithm is based on the chain-code correlation and other shape similarity criteria such as invariant moments. Closed contours and the salient segments along the open contours are matched separately. This method works well for image pairs in which the contour information is well preserved, such as the optical images from Landsat and Spot satellites. For the registration of the optical images with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, the authors propose an elastic contour matching scheme based on the active contour model. Using the contours from the optical image as the initial condition, accurate contour locations in the SAR image are obtained by applying the active contour model. Both contour matching methods are automatic and computationally quite efficient. Experimental results with various kinds of image data have verified the robustness of the algorithms, which have outperformed manual registration in terms of root mean square error at the control points.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8398/00366480.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.366480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.366480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8398","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=366480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A contour-based approach to multisensor image registration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image registration","Adaptive optics","Satellites","Active contours","Layout","Shape","Image segmentation","Remote sensing","Laser radar","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image registration","synthetic aperture radar","radar imaging","remote sensing","remote sensing by radar","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisensor image registration","contour-based approach","multispectral/multisensor images","gray level characteristics","region boundaries","strong edges","matching primitives","chain-code correlation","invariant moments","shape similarity criteria","image pair","optical images","Landsat images","SPOT images","synthetic aperture radar","SAR image","elastic contour matching scheme","contour model","root mean square error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"A contour-based approach to multisensor image registration","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4901977","pubMedId":"18289982","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A contour-based approach to multisensor image registration","sourcePdf":"00366480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049305S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"341","articleId":"366480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":366544,"authors":[{"name":"Sim-Horng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Center for Telecommunications Research, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sim-Horng Chen","id":"37088095843"},{"name":"Yih-Ru Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Center for Telecommunications Research, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yih-Ru Wang","id":"37087357532"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2353"}],"articleNumber":"366544","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":200},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=366544","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Data mining","Hidden Markov models","Shape","Frequency","Pattern recognition","Natural languages","Multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","neural nets","hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous Mandarin speech","neural networks","tone recognition schemes","basic MLP tone recognizer","recognition features","processing syllable","neighboring syllables","coarticulation effect","sandhi rules","tone pronunciation","best tone sequence","input utterance","HCNN","HSMLP","intonation pattern","hidden Markov chain"]}],"doi":"10.1109/89.366544","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/8400/00366544.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","startPage":"146","endPage":"150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.366544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tone recognition of continuous Mandarin speech based on neural networks","abstract":"Several neural network-based tone recognition schemes for continuous Mandarin speech are discussed. A basic MLP tone recognizer using recognition features extracted from the processing syllable is first introduced. Then, some additional features extracted from neighboring syllables are added to compensate for the coarticulation effect. It is then further improved to compensate For the effect of sandhi rules of tone pronunciation by including tone information of neighboring syllables. The recognition criterion is now changed to find the best tone sequence that minimizes the total risk that simultaneously considers tone recognition of all syllables in the input utterance. Last, two approaches using HCNN and HSMLP, respectively, to model the intonation pattern as a hidden Markov chain for assisting tone recognition are proposed. The effectiveness of these schemes was confirmed by simulations on a speaker-independent tone recognition task.

The authors present an analysis dealing with the effect of adaptive quantizers on the stability of ADPCM systems as compared with ADPCM with nonadaptive quantization. Stability of the system is noted to equate with recovery from encoder internal state discrepancies. A sufficient condition for stability that leads to a relation between adaptation rate and stability is presented. This indicates that a price is paid for adaptation in terms of more stringent restrictions on the predictor to guarantee stability. The theorem further indicates that stability is related to the maximum rate of quantizer step size decrease and can be viewed as a theoretical justification for the shape of the Jayant \"one-word memory\" multiplier curve for adaptive quantization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/89.366546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/8400/00366546.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.366546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Destabilization effects of adaptive quantization in ADPCM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Destabilization effects of adaptive quantization in ADPCM","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4895948","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Destabilization effects of adaptive quantization in ADPCM","sourcePdf":"00366546.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044621S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"6","articleId":"366546","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":366547,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

The paper establishes a theoretical basis for the slow asymptotic convergence that is often noted in practice for such applications. The analytical approach expresses the mean-square error trajectory in terms of eigenmodes and then applies the asymptotic theory of Toeplitz matrices to obtain a solution that is based on a general characterization of the actual room impulse response. The method leads to good approximations even for a moderate number of taps (N>16) and applies to both full-band and subband designs. Explicit mathematical expressions of the mean-square error convergence are derived for bandlimited white noise, a first-order Markov process, and, more generally, pth-order rational spectra and a direct power-law model, which relates to lowpass FIR filters. These expressions show that the asymptotic convergence is generally slow, being at best of order 1/t for bandlimited white noise. It is argued that input filter design cannot do much to improve slow convergence. However, the theory suggests postfiltering as a remedy that would be useful for the full-band LMS AEC and may also be applicable to subband designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/89.366547","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/8400/00366547.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.366547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slow asymptotic convergence of LMS acoustic echo cancelers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=366547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366547/","displayDocTitle":"Slow asymptotic convergence of LMS acoustic echo cancelers","volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4895947","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slow asymptotic convergence of LMS acoustic echo cancelers","sourcePdf":"00366547.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032555S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"61","articleId":"366547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":366564,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Recently, there have been attempts to generalize such algorithms to the case of hollow or \"shell-like\" clusters, i.e., clusters that lie in subspaces of feature space. The shell clustering approach provides a powerful means to solve the hitherto unsolved problem of simultaneously fitting multiple curves/surfaces to unsegmented, scattered and sparse data. In this paper, we present several fuzzy and possibilistic algorithms to detect linear and quadric shell clusters. We also introduce generalizations of these algorithms in which the prototypes represent sets of higher-order polynomial functions. The suggested algorithms provide a good trade-off between computational complexity and performance, since the objective function used in these algorithms is the sum of squared distances, and the clustering is sensitive to noise and outliers. We show that by using a possibilistic approach to clustering, one can make the proposed algorithms robust.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/91.366564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.366564","endPage":"43","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/8401/00366564.pdf","startPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy and possibilistic shell clustering algorithms and their application to boundary detection and surface approximation.

The simulation of this controller showed that the inference speed of the order of 15 MRPS (rules per second) is easily realizable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4902924","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"3","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of operational transconductance amplifier-based analog fuzzy functional blocks and its application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of operational transconductance amplifier-based analog fuzzy functional blocks and its application","sourcePdf":"00366571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041559S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"31","articleId":"366571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":366589,"authors":[{"name":"J.-L.

The 3D packing problem deals with packing a given set of regular shaped boxes of different sizes and weights into larger containers. The algorithm must seek to minimize the wasted space under a constraint: the heavier and the larger boxes must be placed below the lighter ones. The present emphasis is to find a good solution quickly by heuristic means. A set of heuristic rules is incorporated into the genetic algorithm (GA) approach to aid in optimization. This hybrid GA yields an optimization algorithm that outperforms either of the parts.

Our proofs use reductions from few-prover, one-round interactive proof systems, either directly, or through a set-cover problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1993.366815","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1993.366815","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE 34th Annual Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel2/2962/8405/00366815.pdf","startPage":"724","endPage":"733","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE 34th Annual Foundations of Computer Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The hardness of approximate optima in lattices, codes, and systems of linear equations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The hardness of approximate optima in lattices, codes, and systems of linear equations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov 1993","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4858039","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The hardness of approximate optima in lattices, codes, and systems of linear equations","confLoc":"Palo Alto, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00366815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061913S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2962","citationCount":"56","articleId":"366815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":366816,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

The algorithm runs in time that is polynomial in N (the number of nodes in the network) and /spl epsiv//sup -1/ (the closeness of the approximation to optimal). The algorithm is remarkable in that it is much simpler than all known polynomial time flow algorithms (including algorithms for the special case of one-commodity flow). In particular, the algorithm does not rely on augmenting paths, shortest paths, min-cost paths, or similar techniques to push flow through a network. In fact, no explicit attempt is ever made to push flow towards a sink during the algorithm. Because the algorithm is so simple, it can be applied to a variety of problems for which centralized decision making and flow planning is not possible. For example, the algorithm can be easily implemented with local control in a distributed network and it can be made tolerant to link failures. In addition, the algorithm appears to perform well in practice. Initial experiments using the DIMACS generator of test problems indicate that the algorithm performs as well as or better than previously known algorithms, at least for certain test problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE 34th Annual Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE 34th Annual Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel2/2962/8405/00366841.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"468","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1993.366841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1993.366841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple local-control approximation algorithm for multicommodity flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/366841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"A simple local-control approximation algorithm for multicommodity flow","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4858013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple local-control approximation algorithm for multicommodity flow","confLoc":"Palo Alto, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00366841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035221S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2962","citationCount":"47","articleId":"366841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":366851,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Due to the limitations in observing large numbers of nodes, it has become increasingly necessary to compact the output from a large number of lines to a small number of lines in a process known as space compaction. Recently, a class of circuit-specific space compactors, known as programmable space compactors (PSCs), has been proposed. Circuit-specific information such as the fault-free and expected faulty behaviour of a circuit can be used to choose PSCs that have better fault coverage and/or lower area costs than the parity function. A drawback of PSCs is the difficulty involved in finding optimal PSCs for a circuit, since the space of possible PSC functions is extremely large and grows exponentially with the number of lines to be compacted. This paper proposes a method for searching for combinational PSCs based upon genetic algorithms. The factors used to assess the effectiveness, or fitness, of a PSC are its fault coverage (estimated by the probability of aliasing) and area. Searches based upon genetic algorithms can find PSCs with better fault coverage and cost characteristics than the parity function using modest computing resources. PSCs with equal or greater fault coverage than the parity function for as little as 20% of the cost (in terms of gate count) were found with an investment of only a few hours of workstation computing time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ATS.1994.367225","pdfPath":"/iel2/2966/8409/00367225.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"241","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.1994.367225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selecting programmable space compactors for BIST using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Selecting programmable space compactors for BIST using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4868984","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selecting programmable space compactors for BIST using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"00367225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084837S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2966","citationCount":"9","articleId":"367225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":367242,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The Formal Development Methodology (FDM) was used to describe system and component security properties, including access control, label consistency, and communications constraints. These descriptions were then used as input to the FDM theorem prover to prove the hypotheses of the Abadi Lamport Composition Rule. Although the FDM tools were not designed for this application, they were found to be usable as long as the properties being addressed are limited to safety properties. The Abadi Lamport framework provides a powerful, well-grounded mathematical proof rule for composing the properties of components to form systems. The combination of this framework and a usable supporting tool set is especially valuable for system integration efforts, in that it enhances the integrator's ability to describe, analyze, understand, and control the integration process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Dec 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852792","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Applying the Abadi-Lamport composition theorem in real-world secure system integration environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying the Abadi-Lamport composition theorem in real-world secure system integration environments","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00367294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032167S","chronDate":"5-9 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2967","citationCount":"1","articleId":"367294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":367313,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Our work is motivated by the intrusion detection paradigm, but is an attempt to avoid ad hoc approaches to codifying misuse behavior. Our approach is based on the observation that although privileged programs can be exploited (due to errors) to cause security compromises in systems because of the privileges accorded to them, the intended behavior of privileged programs is, of course, limited and benign. The key, then, is to specify the intended behavior (i.e. the program policy) and to detect any action by a privileged program that is outside the intended behavior and that imperils security. We describe a program policy specification language, which is based on simple predicate logic and regular expressions. In addition, we present specifications of privileged programs in Unix, and a prototype execution monitor for analyzing audit trails with respect to these specifications. The program policies are surprisingly concise and clear, and in addition, capable of detecting exploitations of known vulnerabilities in these programs. Although our work has been motivated by the known vulnerabilities in Unix, we believe that by tightly restricting the behavior of all privileged programs, exploitations of unknown vulnerabilities can be detected. As a check on the specifications, work is in progress on verifying them with respect to an abstract security policy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Tenth Annual Computer Security Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/2967/8410/00367313.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"144","publicationTitle":"Tenth Annual Computer Security Applications Conference","doi":"10.1109/CSAC.1994.367313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSAC.1994.367313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=367313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated detection of vulnerabilities in privileged programs by execution monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computerized monitoring","National security","Specification languages","Logic","Computer security","Contracts","Fingers","Computer science","Intrusion detection","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system monitoring","authorisation","Unix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated vulnerability detection","privileged programs","execution monitoring","vulnerability exploitation","program execution monitoring","audit trails","security-relevant behavior specification","intrusion detection","misuse behavior","errors","security compromises","program policy specification language","intended behavior","predicate logic","regular expressions","Unix","abstract security policy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Automated detection of vulnerabilities in privileged programs by execution monitoring","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852773","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated detection of vulnerabilities in privileged programs by execution monitoring","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00367313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037268S","chronDate":"5-9 Dec 1994","isNumber":"8410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2967","citationCount":"74","articleId":"367313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":367401,"authors":[{"name":"V.S.

Finally, they investigate the eventual phase noise level.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.1993.367402","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/2968/8411/00367402.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"250","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.1993.367402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete spurious signals and background noise in direct frequency synthesizers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Discrete spurious signals and background noise in direct frequency synthesizers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 June 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979130","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367402/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete spurious signals and background noise in direct frequency synthesizers","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00367402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048097S","chronDate":"2-4 Jun 1993","isNumber":"8411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2968","citationCount":"21","articleId":"367402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":367410,"authors":[{"name":"F.G.

Two-channel measurement systems and cross-correlation analysis were used. In amplifiers there are at least two random noise processes that generate equal levels of PM and AM noise when the amplifier is in the linear operating range. The noise processes correspond to a flicker noise process and a white noise process. In the DRO sources these noise mechanisms are shown to be present in the active components and determine the AM and PM characteristics of the oscillator. A noise model for oscillators incorporating Leeson's PM noise model and a model for AM noise in which the active components have two common random noise processes are proposed. The authors report AM noise levels of 140 dB below the PM levels at 1 Hz and typical noise floors of -169 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz. Noise residuals in mixers from three different companies are reported. Typical 1 Hz intercepts vary from -110 to -127 dBc/Hz.

Frequency-temperature self-compensation, in which the temperature dependence of the real part of the AC susceptibility of paramagnetic impurities balances that due to the dielectric constant of the sapphire, can be achieved in H modes at convenient operating temperatures.

The SPS uses a high-Q, X-band sapphire dielectric whispering-gallery mode resonator as a discriminator to stabilize a quartz crystal oscillator. At an untuned frequency of 7.9449 GHz with a loaded Q of 6 million, an \"open loop\" discriminator noise floor (referred to 100 MHz) of approximately S/sub phi/(f) = -110 dB/f/sup 3/(/Hz) was previously reported for offset frequencies from 1 Hz to 1 kHz. Precise tuning of the sapphire resonant frequency now allows implementation of simplified control loops together with suppressed-carrier phase sensing circuitry. These improvements make possible an ultralow-noise demonstration of closed-loop SPS performance. From 1 Hz to 1 kHz a comparison of the SPS with a quartz crystal reference oscillator of the highest quality showed only the noise of the reference oscillator. These results appear to represent the lowest phase noise in a closed-loop or active sapphire oscillator to date at temperatures achievable with liquid nitrogen (77 K or higher).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.1993.367476","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/2968/8411/00367476.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.1993.367476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8411","startPage":"774","endPage":"778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed loop tests of the NASA sapphire phase stabilizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=367476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Closed loop tests of the NASA sapphire phase stabilizer","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367476/","conferenceDate":"2-4 June 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979204","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed loop tests of the NASA sapphire phase stabilizer","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00367476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028152S","chronDate":"2-4 Jun 1993","isNumber":"8411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2968","citationCount":"19","articleId":"367476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":367477,"authors":[{"name":"D.P.

Without the protection for the chip that a package body affords however, reduced mechanical robustness and a decrease in reliability performance are potential concerns. In addition, the inherent thermal mismatch between the chip and substrate, particularly with an organic printed circuit board, will produce an accumulation of stress in the solder joints under normal operating conditions that can result in relatively premature failures. Coupling the chip and substrate together with an encapsulation material under the chip face has successfully overcome these mechanical and reliability issues. However, the success of the encapsulation is dependent on many factors. Among these are the encapsulant's material properties, and its compatibility with the chip and substrate surfaces. Thus, the selection of the basic materials to be used in the Flip Chip on Board (FCOB) assembly are interrelated and critical to the subsequent performance of the completed assembly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The importance of material selection for flip chip on board assemblies","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings. 44th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1994.367560","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings. 44th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/2969/8412/00367560.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1994.367560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=367560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"The importance of material selection for flip chip on board assemblies","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4874588","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The importance of material selection for flip chip on board assemblies","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00367560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039537S","chronDate":"1-4 May 1994","isNumber":"8412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2969","citationCount":"19","articleId":"367560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":367620,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Reactive ion etching (RIE) in RF glow discharges is used extensively to form via holes in SiO/sub 2/ between metal layers of a multichip module. However, the precise modeling of RIE is difficult due to the extremely complex nature of particle dynamics within a plasma. Recently, empirical RIE models derived from neural networks have been shown to offer advantages in both accuracy and robustness over more traditional statistical approaches. In this paper, neural networks are used to build models of etch rate, anisotropy, uniformity, and selectivity for SiO/sub 2/ films etched in a chloroform and oxygen plasma. Back-propagation neural nets were trained on data resulting from a 2/sup 4/ factorial experiment designed to characterize etch variation with RF power, pressure and gas composition. Etching took place in a Plasma Therm 700 series RIE system. Excellent agreement between model predictions and measured data was obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1994.367620","pdfPath":"/iel2/2969/8412/00367620.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"278","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings. 44th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings. 44th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1994.367620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling reactive ion etching of silicon dioxide films using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Modeling reactive ion etching of silicon dioxide films using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4858607","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling reactive ion etching of silicon dioxide films using neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00367620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028953S","chronDate":"1-4 May 1994","isNumber":"8412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2969","citationCount":"3","articleId":"367620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":367685,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The authors consider a task in which the robots and humans manipulate an object in coordination. The authors assume that no interactions occur among robots and humans, that is, robots and humans have interactions with each other only through the object. The authors also assume that the humans are manipulating the object around a point fixed to the object. Under these assumptions, the authors design a controller for each robot around the point so that the object has a prescribed passive dynamics around the point. The stability of the resultant system is assured based on Popov's hyper stability theorem under the assumption that the passivity conditions for the humans are satisfied. The resultant control algorithm is applied to an experimental system, which consists of two industrial manipulators and a human. The results illustrate the proposed control algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov 1993","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4846347","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic control for robot-human collaboration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic control for robot-human collaboration","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00367685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047556S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2970","citationCount":"39","articleId":"367685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":367724,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Our final goal is to realize very natural and user-friendly human-machine communication environment by giving a face to computer terminal or communication system which can also understand the user's emotion condition. So it is necessary for the emotion model to express emotional meanings of a parameterized face expression and its motion quantitatively. Our emotion model is based on 5-layered neural network which has generalization and nonlinear mapping performance. Both input and output layer has the same number of units. So identity mapping can be realized and emotion space can be constructed in the middle-layer (3rd layer). The mapping from input layer to middle layer means emotion recognition and that from middle layer to output layer corresponds to expression synthesis from the emotion value. Training is performed by typical 13 emotion patterns which are expressed by expression parameters. Subjective test of this emotion space proves the propriety of this model. The facial action coding system is selected as an efficient criteria to describe delicate face expression and motion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367724/","accessionNumber":"4846308","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Emotion space for analysis and synthesis of facial expression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion space for analysis and synthesis of facial expression","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00367724.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105223S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov 1993","isNumber":"8413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2970","citationCount":"14","articleId":"367724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":367787,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Thus, there is a clear need to develop computational methods which can abstract human decision-making processes based on sensory feedback. Neural networks offer one such method with their ability to map complex nonlinear functions. In this paper, we examine the potential of an efficient neural network learning architecture to the problems of system identification and control. The cascade two learning architecture dynamically adjusts the size of the network as part of the learning process. As such, it allows different units to have different activation functions, resulting in faster learning, smoother approximations, and fewer required hidden units.

The major novelty of this approach is a rigorous proof of identification error convergence that reveals a requirement for a new identifier structure and nonstandard weight tuning algorithms under the assumption that the states of the plant are available for measurement. The NN identifier includes delta rule weight tuning and exhibits a learning-while-functioning-features instead of learning-then-functioning so that the identification is immediate with no explicit off-line learning phase needed. The structure of the neural net identifier is derived using a passivity approach. Linearity in the parameters is not required and certainty equivalence is not used. This overcomes several limitations of standard adaptive control. The notion of persistency of excitation (PE) for multilayer NN is explored. The notions of discrete-time passive NN are introduced. This new NN passivity property is employed to demonstrate the boundedness of weight estimates. Simulation studies indicate that the theoretical claims are justified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1994.367793","pdfPath":"/iel2/2971/8414/00367793.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"351","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 9th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 9th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00367793.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1994.367793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of a class of nonlinear dynamical systems using multilayer neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Identification of a class of nonlinear dynamical systems using multilayer neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4857996","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of a class of nonlinear dynamical systems using multilayer neural networks","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00367793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04554S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2971","articleId":"367793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":367803,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

The approach here is based on using the output error of the system to train the NN controller without the need to assume or construct a separate model (NN or other type) for the unknown process dynamics. To implement such a direct adaptive control approach, it is required that connection weights in the NN be estimated while the system is being controlled. As a result of the feedback of the unknown process dynamics, however, it is not possible to determine the gradient of the loss function for use in standard (backpropagation-type) weight estimation algorithms. Therefore, this paper consider's the use of a new stochastic approximation algorithm for this weight estimation, which is based on a \"simultaneous perturbation\" gradient approximation that only requires the system output error. It is shown that this algorithm can greatly enhance the efficiency over more standard stochastic approximation algorithms based on finite-difference gradient approximations. The approach is illustrated on a simulated wastewater treatment system with stochastic effects and nonstationary dynamics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1994.367805","pdfPath":"/iel2/2971/8414/00367805.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"278","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 9th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 9th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1994.367805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network controller for systems with unmodeled dynamics with applications to wastewater treatment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"A neural network controller for systems with unmodeled dynamics with applications to wastewater treatment","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4857984","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network controller for systems with unmodeled dynamics with applications to wastewater treatment","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00367805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040546S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2971","citationCount":"2","articleId":"367805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":367813,"authors":[{"name":"T.W.

The fuzzy inference engine can be implemented in the form of a network of FCMs. FCM implementation of the inference engine provides a suitable mechanism for expert control systems and information engineers to embed acquired human expertise, which is often imprecise, vague, or incomplete. The exploitation of an online learning algorithm empowers the fuzzy inference engine with the ability to modify its incomplete or possibly inconsistent knowledge base resulting in continuous improvement of the embedded knowledge. The fact that learning is an inherent feature of neural networks has inspired several researchers with the idea of using neural networks to implement fuzzy inference engines capable of learning. This paper presents a method for neural network FCM implementation of the fuzzy inference engine using the fuzzy columnar neural network architecture (FCNA). In this method the available human expertise is mapped first into an initial set of weights for the neurons. A new learning algorithm is then used to enhance the embedded knowledge in the neural network as a result of real time experience. The fuzzy inference engine (the neural network FCM) is used in computer simulations to control the speed of an underwater autonomous mobile robot. Results and computer simulation experiments are presented along with an evaluation of the new approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/367848/","accessionNumber":"4851273","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy neural network implementation of self tuning PID control systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy neural network implementation of self tuning PID control systems","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00367848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048038S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2971","citationCount":"7","articleId":"367848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":367997,"authors":[{"name":"D.

With additional functional units packed into one chip in a 3-D space, computer-aided design (CAD) tools are demanded to ease the complicated design work. This paper presents a 100% completion achievable routing methodology. The routing methodology is based on the two-dimensional (2D) channel routing methodology; thus, it is called a 3-D channel routing methodology. With the routing methodology, a 3-D routing problem is decomposed into two 2D routing subproblems: intra-layer routing that interconnects terminals on the same layer, which can be done by using a 2-D channel router, and inter-layer routing that interconnects terminals on different layers. The inter-layer routing problem is transformed into a 2-D channel routing problem and the transformation is made in some 3-D channels. Detailed discussions are given for the 3-D to 2-D transformation. Optimization of the transformation is shown to be NP-complete. Thus, simulated annealing is used to optimize the transformation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8421/00368006.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.368006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.368006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8421","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing in a three-dimensional chip","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Silicon on insulator technology","Integrated circuit interconnections","Very large scale integration","Design automation","Silicides","Space technology","Food technology","Wires","Chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","network routing","circuit CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional chip","very large scale integration","VLSI","packing density","computer-aided design","CAD","routing methodology","3-D channel routing","NP-complete","simulated annealing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Routing in a three-dimensional chip","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4887644","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing in a three-dimensional chip","sourcePdf":"00368006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041234S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","articleId":"368006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":368008,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

In practice, real-time systems require an integrated, consistent approach to scheduling that is able to simultaneously meet the timing requirements of hard deadline periodic tasks, hard deadline aperiodic (alert-class) tasks, and soft deadline aperiodic tasks. This paper introduces the Deferrable Server (DS) algorithm which will be shown to provide improved aperiodic response time performance over traditional background and polling approaches. Taking advantage of the fact that, typically, there is no benefit in early completion of the periodic tasks, the Deferrable Server (DS) algorithm assigns higher priority to the aperiodic tasks up until the point where the periodic tasks would start to miss their deadlines. Guaranteed alert-class aperiodic service and greatly reduced response times for soft deadline aperiodic tasks are important features of the DS algorithm, and both are obtained with the hard deadlines of the periodic tasks still being guaranteed. The results of a simulation study performed to evaluate the response time performance of the new algorithm against traditional background and polling approaches are presented. In all cases, the response times of aperiodic tasks are significantly reduced (often by an order of magnitude) while still maintaining guaranteed periodic task deadlines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4887642","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"The deferrable server algorithm for enhanced aperiodic responsiveness in hard real-time environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The deferrable server algorithm for enhanced aperiodic responsiveness in hard real-time environments","sourcePdf":"00368008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044348S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"252","articleId":"368008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":368012,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The delays induced by rendezvous can cause serious performance problems, which are not easy to estimate using conventional models which focus on hardware contention, or on a restricted view of the parallelism which ignores implementation constraints. Stochastic rendezvous networks are queueing networks of a new type which have been proposed as a modelling framework for these systems. They incorporate the two key phenomena of included service and a second phase of service. This paper extends the model to also incorporate different services or entries associated with each task. Approximations to arrival-instant probabilities are employed with a mean-value analysis framework, to give approximate performance estimates. The method has been applied to moderately large industrial software systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Delay estimation","Communication system software","Client-server systems","Carbon capture and storage","Hardware","Stochastic systems","Performance analysis","Computer industry","Software systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel programming","transputer systems","delays","client-server systems","remote procedure calls","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic rendezvous network model","performance evaluation","synchronous client-server-like distributed software","open distributed systems","implementation environments","Ada","V","remote procedure call systems","transputer systems","specification techniques","CSP","CCS","LOTOS","delays","queueing networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/12.368012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8421/00368012.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.368012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The stochastic rendezvous network model for performance of synchronous client-server-like distributed software","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The stochastic rendezvous network model for performance of synchronous client-server-like distributed software","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368012/","volume":"44","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4887638","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The stochastic rendezvous network model for performance of synchronous client-server-like distributed software","sourcePdf":"00368012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038966S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"163","articleId":"368012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":368033,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Although both types of stress lead to qualitatively similar changes in the current gain of the device, the physical mechanisms responsible for the degradation are quite different. In the case of hot-carrier stress the damage is localized near the emitter-base junction, which causes the excess base current to have an ideality factor of two. For ionizing radiation stress, the damage occurs along all oxide-silicon interfaces, which causes the excess base current to have an ideality factor between one and two for low total doses of ionizing radiation, but an ideality factor of two for large total doses. The different physical mechanisms that apply for each type of stress imply that improvement in resistance to one type of stress does not necessarily imply improvement in resistance to the other type of stress. Based on the physical model, implications for correlating and comparing hot-carrier-induced and ionizing-radiation-induced damage are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physically based comparison of hot-carrier-induced and ionizing-radiation-induced degradation in BJTs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.368041","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/8422/00368041.pdf","startPage":"436","endPage":"444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.368041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8422","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368041/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Physically based comparison of hot-carrier-induced and ionizing-radiation-induced degradation in BJTs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907164","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physically based comparison of hot-carrier-induced and ionizing-radiation-induced degradation in BJTs","sourcePdf":"00368041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037954S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"93","articleId":"368041","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":368043,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Selectively formed TiSi/sub 2/ films on source contacts were used to reduce the contact resistance to n/sup +/ source diffusion. These devices exhibit \"kinks\" in the output I-V characteristics. High contact resistance of TiSi/sub 2/ to moderately doped p-body diffusion causes high output conductance. Detailed two-dimensional numerical simulations are used to investigate the effect of the parasitic bipolar transistor on the static characteristics of scaled silicided DMOSFET's. The high contact resistance of TiSi/sub 2/-p-body interface leads to a floating potential and causes significant reduction in the MOS gate threshold voltage and results in a premature bipolar turn-on. It is shown that the parasitic bipolar turn-on places an important constraint on the scalability of the device into the submicron regime. A novel self-aligned DMOSFET structure with a shallow diffused p/sup +/ region is shown to eliminate this effect. Numerical simulations are shown to be in excellent agreement with the measured data at various temperatures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current-voltage characteristics","Contact resistance","Bipolar transistors","Numerical simulation","MOSFET circuits","Power MOSFET","Scalability","Temperature","Power semiconductor switches","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["characteristics measurement","power MOSFET","semiconductor device reliability","contact resistance","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar turn-on","static current-voltage characteristics","scaled vertical power DMOSFET","parasitic bipolar transistor","power vertical double diffused MOSFET","reliability","TiSi/sub 2/ films","source contacts","contact resistance","kinks","output I-V characteristics","output conductance","two-dimensional numerical simulations","static characteristics","floating potential","MOS gate threshold voltage","scalability","TiSi/sub 2/"]}],"doi":"10.1109/16.368054","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/8422/00368054.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.368054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of bipolar turn-on on the static current-voltage characteristics of scaled vertical power DMOSFET's","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of bipolar turn-on on the static current-voltage characteristics of scaled vertical power DMOSFET's","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368054/","volume":"42","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4907178","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of bipolar turn-on on the static current-voltage characteristics of scaled vertical power DMOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00368054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048729S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"14","articleId":"368054","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":368072,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Several of these methods may be used simultaneously by an 8-bit digital oscilloscope to provide, in averaging mode, the linearity of an 11- or 12-bit ADC.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.368074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel3/19/8423/00368074.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.368074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8423","startPage":"922","endPage":"928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement in the linearity of fast digital oscilloscopes used in averaging mode","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improvement in the linearity of fast digital oscilloscopes used in averaging mode","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4866858","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement in the linearity of fast digital oscilloscopes used in averaging mode","sourcePdf":"00368074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040701S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"8423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"11","articleId":"368074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":368077,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.

Changes in the resistance can be measured directly using an ac-operated bridge configuration. A special technique has been employed to convert these changes into a phase angle relative to the excitation signal. The instrumentation amplifier should have a very high Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) at a relatively high bridge operating frequency (100 kHz) in order to actually exploit the advantages of this readout method. The filter should have a well-determined phase behavior to prevent a change in the frequency from affecting the output phase angle. Special emphasis has been placed on the compatibility between micromachining technologies in silicon and bipolar processing, so that a fully integrated smart silicon micromechanical sensor can be made.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Bridges","Frequency","Silicon","Band pass filters","Piezoresistance","Electrical resistance measurement","Micromachining","Micromechanical devices","Intelligent sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piezoresistive devices","strain gauges","instrumentation amplifiers","band-pass filters","electric sensing devices","bridge circuits","silicon","elemental semiconductors","bipolar integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated instrumentation amplifier","phase readout","piezoresistive strain gauges","bandpass filter","bipolar process","piezoresistive sensors","ac-operated bridge configuration","phase angle","excitation signal","Common-Mode Rejection Ratio","compatibility","micromachining technologies","bipolar processing","Si integrated smart micromechanical sensor","100 kHz","Si"]}],"doi":"10.1109/19.368077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel3/19/8423/00368077.pdf","startPage":"906","endPage":"911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.368077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated instrumentation amplifier for the phase readout of piezoresistive strain gauges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated instrumentation amplifier for the phase readout of piezoresistive strain gauges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368077/","volume":"43","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4866855","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated instrumentation amplifier for the phase readout of piezoresistive strain gauges","sourcePdf":"00368077.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028916S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"8423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"1","articleId":"368077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":368081,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Rong Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Rong Chang","id":"37087180789"},{"name":"Bor-Chin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bor-Chin Wang","id":"37087495665"},{"name":"H.M.

The response of the sensor is expressed in terms of its input by a power series. In the direct modeling, using a FLANN trained by a simple neural algorithm, the unknown coefficients of the power series are estimated accurately. The FLANN-based inverse model of the sensor can estimate the applied pressure accurately. The maximum error between the measured and estimated values is found to be only /spl plusmn/2%. The existing techniques utilize ROM or nonlinear schemes for linearization of the sensor response. However, the proposed inverse model approach automatically compensates the effect of the associated nonlinearity to estimate the applied pressure. Frequent modification of the ROM or nonlinear coding data is required for correct readout during changing environmental conditions. Under such conditions, in the proposed technique, for correct readout, the FLANN is to be retrained and a new set of coefficients is entered into the plug-in module. Thus this modeling technique provides greater flexibility and accuracy in a changing environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.368082","startPage":"874","endPage":"881","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel3/19/8423/00368082.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.368082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network-based nonlinearity estimation of pressure sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Read only memory","Temperature sensors","Transducers","Inverse problems","Instruments","Humidity","Consumer electronics","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pressure sensors","neural nets","parameter estimation","electric sensing devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinearity estimation","pressure sensors","functional link artificial neural network","direct modeling","neural algorithm","power series","inverse mode","maximum error","ROM","linearization","nonlinear coding","correct readout","FLANN","plug-in module"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network-based nonlinearity estimation of pressure sensors","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4866850","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network-based nonlinearity estimation of pressure sensors","sourcePdf":"00368082.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031234S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"8423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"96","articleId":"368082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":368083,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Diagnosis and a systematic approach to maximize the fault location capability are proposed. This unified approach is realized as a result of combining the simulation before test (SBT) fault dictionary diagnosis method with a symbolic approach. The traditional SBT fault dictionary method is often costly aid inefficient because of a high number of simulations, but it can become very efficient when a symbolic approach is employed. This symbolic approach only requires one analysis for circuit topology to generate the network transfer function and a parameter substitution to obtain the frequency response (or time response) of the system. An efficient program is developed to deal with the frequency responses of the system to provide the optimum testing point set, and to automatically generate the fault dictionary. The \"distance\" between the measurement data and the frequency responses from the fault dictionary is evaluated to determine the diagnosis results. A practical example is presented in order to illustrate the main features of this proposed analog system fault diagnosis approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.368107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel3/19/8424/00368107.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.368107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8424","startPage":"28","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog system-level fault diagnosis based on a symbolic method in the frequency domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analog system-level fault diagnosis based on a symbolic method in the frequency domain","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4866869","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog system-level fault diagnosis based on a symbolic method in the frequency domain","sourcePdf":"00368107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04831S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"18","articleId":"368107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":368108,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Lei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Ching-Lei Li","id":"37088133936"},{"name":"Kun-Mu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Kun-Mu Chen","id":"37087160387"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9662"}],"articleNumber":"368108","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":604},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ims.org/main/index.php"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of electromagnetic properties of materials using flanged open-ended coaxial probe-full-wave analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368108","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coaxial components","Probes","Conducting materials","Dielectric materials","Apertures","Permittivity measurement","Dielectric measurements","Electromagnetic scattering","Electromagnetic analysis","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave measurement","permittivity measurement","magnetic permeability measurement","nondestructive testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic properties","open-ended coaxial probe","full-wave analysis","EM properties measurement","flanged open-ended coaxial probe","excitation of complex waves","surface waves","radiative waves","radial guided waves","layered material media","complex permittivity","permeability","0.3 to 4 GHz"]}],"abstract":"A full-wave analysis is applied to the scheme of measuring electromagnetic (EM) properties of materials over the frequency range of 0.3-4 GHz using a flanged open-ended coaxial probe.

The efficiency of this constrained algorithm is demonstrated using both synthetic and real-world data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.368111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","startPage":"2","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.368111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8424","pdfPath":"/iel3/19/8424/00368111.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mass spectroscopy","Integral equations","Optical filters","Algorithm design and analysis","Error correction","Instruments","Optical recording","Absorption","Light sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","spectral analysis","spectrophotometry","spectroscopy","computerised instrumentation","spectroscopy computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["positivity constraint","Kalman-filter-based algorithm","correction","spectrometric data","spectrometric analyses","numerical processing","systematic errors","random errors","convolution-type equation","real-world data","synthetic data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Incorporation of a positivity constraint into a Kalman-filter-based algorithm for correction of spectrometric data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368111/","volume":"44","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4866865","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporation of a positivity constraint into a Kalman-filter-based algorithm for correction of spectrometric data","sourcePdf":"00368111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028855S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"62","articleId":"368111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":368145,"authors":[{"name":"Y.S.

Six FD features are based on the original image, the above average/high gray level image, the below average/low gray level image, the horizontally smoothed image, the vertically smoothed image, and the multi-fractal dimension of order two. A modified box-counting approach is proposed to estimate the FD, in combination with feature smoothing in order to reduce spurious regions. To segment a scene into the desired number of classes, an unsupervised K-means like clustering approach is used. Mosaics of various natural textures from the Brodatz album as well as microphotographs of thin sections of natural rocks are considered, and the segmentation results to show the efficiency of the technique. Supervised techniques such as minimum-distance and k-nearest neighbor classification are also considered.

In this study a neural network approach is introduced to perform high accuracy recognition on multi-size and multi-font characters; a novel centroid-dithering training process with a low noise-sensitivity normalization procedure is used to achieve high accuracy results. The study consists of two parts. The first part focuses on single size and single font characters, and a two-layered neural network is trained to recognize the full set of 94 ASCII character images in 12-pt Courier font. The second part trades accuracy for additional font and size capability, and a larger two-layered neural network is trained to recognize the full set of 94 ASCII character images for all point sizes from 8 to 32 and for 12 commonly used fonts. The performance of these two networks is evaluated based on a database of more than one million character images from the testing data set.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.368165","startPage":"218","endPage":"224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.368165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8428","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/8428/00368165.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High accuracy optical character recognition using neural networks with centroid dithering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368165/","displayDocTitle":"High accuracy optical character recognition using neural networks with centroid dithering","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4887746","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High accuracy optical character recognition using neural networks with centroid dithering","sourcePdf":"00368165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069822S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"48","articleId":"368165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":368168,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The image was divided into several layers of gray level intensities and thresholded. A binary image was obtained and grouped into clusters using image segmentation techniques. Using the centroid measurements of the clusters, the probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) was employed for tracking the target centroid. In this correspondence, the division of the image into several layers of gray level intensities is optimized by minimizing the Bayes risk. This optimal layering of the image has the following properties: (1) following the segmentation, a closed-form analytical expression is obtained for the noise variance of the centroid measurement based on a single frame; (2) in comparison to the previous paper, the measurement noise variance is smaller by at least a factor of 2, thus improving the performance of the tracker. The usefulness of the method for practical applications is demonstrated by considering a sequence of real target images (a moving car) of about 20 pixels in size in a noisy urban environment where the measurement noise was calculated as having 0.32 pixel RMS value. Filtering with the PDAF further reduces this by a factor of 1.6.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.368171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/8428/00368171.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.368171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8428","startPage":"182","endPage":"188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precision tracking based on segmentation with optimal layering for imaging sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precision tracking based on segmentation with optimal layering for imaging sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4887740","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precision tracking based on segmentation with optimal layering for imaging sensors","sourcePdf":"00368171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029999S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"26","articleId":"368171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":368176,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The problem of finding a suitable structure of the neural network can be linked to a number of well established techniques in statistical pattern recognition. Discriminative training of neural network outputs amounts to approximating the class or posterior probabilities of the classical statistical approach. This paper extends these links by introducing and analyzing novel criteria such as maximizing the class probability and minimizing the smoothed error rate. These criteria are defined in the framework of class conditional probability density functions. We show that these criteria can be interpreted in terms of weighted maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, this approach covers widely used techniques such as corrective training, learning vector quantization, and linear discriminant analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.368176","startPage":"107","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.368176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8428","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/8428/00368176.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the probabilistic interpretation of neural network classifiers and discriminative training criteria","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368176/","displayDocTitle":"On the probabilistic interpretation of neural network classifiers and discriminative training criteria","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4887735","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the probabilistic interpretation of neural network classifiers and discriminative training criteria","sourcePdf":"00368176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058831S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"45","articleId":"368176","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":368188,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A new method of obtaining local projective and affine invariants is developed and implemented for real images. Being local, the Invariants are much less sensitive to occlusion than global invariants. The invariants' computation is based on a canonical method. This consists of defining a canonical coordinate system by the intrinsic properties of the shape, independently of the given coordinate system. Since this canonical system is independent of the original one, it is invariant and all quantities defined in it are invariant. The method was applied without the use of a curve parameter. This was achieved by fitting an implicit polynomial to an arbitrary curve in a vicinity of each curve point. Several configurations are treated: a general curve without any correspondence and curves with known correspondences of one or two feature points or lines. Experimental results for different 2D objects in 3D space are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","publicationDate":"March 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4913771","volume":"17","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Local invariants for recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local invariants for recognition","sourcePdf":"00368188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058377S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"60","articleId":"368188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":368189,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A representation of parts for recognition requires that they be invariant to rigid transformations, robust in the presence of occlusions, stable with changes in viewing geometry, and be arranged in a hierarchy. These constraints are captured in a general framework using notions of a PART-LINE and a PARTITIONING SCHEME. A proposed general principle of \"form from function\" motivates a particular partitioning scheme involving two types of parts, neck-based and limb-based. Neck-based parts arise from narrowings in shape, or the local minima in distance between two points on the boundary, while limb-based parts arise from a pair of negative curvature minima which have \"co-circular\" tangents. In this paper, we present computational support for the limb-based and neck-based parts by showing that they are invariant, robust, stable and yield a hierarchy of parts. Examples illustrate that the resulting decompositions are robust in the presence of occlusion and clutter for a range of man-made and natural objects, and lead to natural and intuitive parts which can be used for recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368189/","volume":"17","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4913772","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Parts of visual form: computational aspects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parts of visual form: computational aspects","sourcePdf":"00368189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02065S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"164","articleId":"368189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":368194,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Terzopoulos et al. (1987) proposed an approach to detect the contour regions of complex shapes, assuming a user selected initial contour not very far from the desired solution. We propose to further explore the information provided by the user's selected points and apply an optimal method to detect contours which allows a segmentation of the image. The method is based on dynamic programming (DP), and applies to a wide variety of shapes. It is exact and not iterative. We also consider a multiscale approach capable of speeding up the algorithm by a factor of 20, although at the expense of losing the guaranteed optimality characteristic. The problem of tracking and matching these contours is addressed. For tracking, the final contour obtained at one frame is sampled and used as initial points for the next frame. Then, the same DP process is applied. For matching, a novel strategy is proposed where the solution is a smooth displacement field in which unmatched regions are allowed while cross vectors are not. The algorithm is again based on DP and the optimal solution is guaranteed. We have demonstrated the algorithms on natural objects in a large spectrum of applications, including interactive segmentation and automatic tracking of the regions of interest in medical images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.368194","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"294","endPage":"302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel3/34/8429/00368194.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.368194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic programming for detecting, tracking, and matching deformable contours","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic programming","Image segmentation","Shape","Iterative algorithms","Biomedical imaging","Deformable models","Iterative methods","Uncertainty","Cost function","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","image sequences","dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","deformable contour detection","deformable contour tracking","deformable contour matching","image segmentation","complex shapes","interactive segmentation","automatic tracking","medical images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic programming for detecting, tracking, and matching deformable contours","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4913776","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368194/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic programming for detecting, tracking, and matching deformable contours","sourcePdf":"00368194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076405S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"291","articleId":"368194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":368198,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Enhancement aimed toward the preservation of certain important perceptual qualities generally calls for the secondary coordinate system to be perceptually based. However, independent modification of the secondary components seldom uses the full extent of the RGB gamut unless some color values are clipped at the RGB boundaries. Preserving perceptual attributes is sometimes less important than obtaining the greatest possible color contrast improvement. This is especially true for color composites derived from multispectral images, which have no significant basis in human perception. A new multivariate enhancement technique the authors have named \"histogram explosion\" is able to exploit nearly the full RGB extent without clipping. While not generally based upon a perceptual model, the method can preserve original hue values when parameters are chosen properly. Experimental results of histogram explosion are presented, along with an analysis of its computational complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.368207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel3/36/8430/00368207.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.368207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8430","startPage":"212","endPage":"216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multivariate contrast enhancement technique for multispectral images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multivariate contrast enhancement technique for multispectral images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4882763","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multivariate contrast enhancement technique for multispectral images","sourcePdf":"00368207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04277S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"32","articleId":"368207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":368216,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

FOPAIR employs a fast, sequentially sampled antenna array and uses a software-based beamforming technique to generate high resolution imagery without the need for multiple radar receivers or beamforming hardware typical of active phased arrays. A summary of the principles of operation and the design of the instrument is given, followed by examples of FOPAIR's imaging capability.

The key element of this technique is a localization of the Radon transform, whereby the intensity integration is performed over short line segments rather than across the entire image. A linear feature detection algorithm, which utilizes this localized Radon transform, is then developed. In this algorithm, referred to as the feature space line detector algorithm, the transform space is subjected to processing which serves to isolate and locate the response of linear features and suppresses the response of false alarms. This algorithm is tested on both synthetic images corrupted by various levels of Weibull multiplicative noise and on actual SAR images of ship wakes. The results of this testing demonstrate the algorithm's robustness in the presence of noise, as well as its ability to detect and localize linear features that are significantly shorter than the image dimensions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.368224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel3/36/8430/00368224.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.368224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localized Radon transform-based detection of ship wakes in SAR images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368224/","displayDocTitle":"Localized Radon transform-based detection of ship wakes in SAR images","volume":"33","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4882746","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localized Radon transform-based detection of ship wakes in SAR images","sourcePdf":"00368224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05149S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"125","articleId":"368224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":368225,"authors":[{"name":"G.P.

The displacements of the surface of a 210 /spl mu/m pitch piezocomposite are probed with a heterodyne, optical interferometer. An animate sequence is then built from the stored transient displacements so that each frame shows the instantaneous state of the surface of the piezocomposite. Such an animation proves to be a powerful analysing tool which provides a real insight into the piezocomposite's impulse behavior. Finally, the ultrasonic field transmitted in water and measured by the same optical probe is compared with simulations based on the diffraction impulse theory.

The acoustic measurement theory for pulse-echo and pitch-catch gap profile measurements is derived from a generalized KLM model representation of ultrasonic transducers located within the gap between two mating structures. Expressions for the ultrasonically measured gap spacing are derived in terms of the thicknesses and longitudinal acoustic velocities of the constituent layers of the transducer element(s), adhesive layers(s), and gap medium. Extremely thin PVDF two-dimensional arrays were fabricated and adhered to the inside of a precision gap profile device for demonstrating the measurement technique. Two-dimensional gap profile measurements were made to /spl plusmn/0.001\" accuracy for a variety of gap profiles in the range of 0-0.200\" thickness. Gap profile measurements were made with both liquid and air as the gap medium and the results show potential for measuring otherwise inaccessible gap profiles between structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4861846","displayDocTitle":"Large-area ultrasonic gap profile measurements using two-dimensional PVDF \"blanket array\" transducers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-area ultrasonic gap profile measurements using two-dimensional PVDF \"blanket array\" transducers","sourcePdf":"368305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039156S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"10","articleId":"368305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":368310,"authors":[{"name":"Pai-Chi Li","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department and the Bioengineering Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Pai-Chi Li","id":"37276870300"},{"name":"M.

The arrays conform to the body maintaining good contact over a large area. To provide full three-dimensional focusing for two-dimensional imaging, such arrays are densely sampled in the scan direction (x) and coarsely sampled in the nonscan direction (y), i.e., the arrays are anisotropic. To illustrate reduction in slice thickness with increased array length in y, a two-dimensional array is synthesized using a one-dimensional, 128 element array with a 3.5 MHz center frequency. A mask is attached confining transmission and reception of acoustic waves to 2 mm in y. Using a mechanical scan system, the one-dimensional array is moved along y covering a 28.16 mm/spl times/20.0 mm aperture. Accordingly, the synthetic array has 128 elements in x and 10 elements in y. To correct for geometric irregularities due to array movement, a gelatin based phantom containing three-dimensional point targets is used for phase aberration correction. Results show that elevational beam quality is degraded if small geometric errors are not removed. Emulated conformality at the body surface and phase aberrations induced by spatial inhomogeneities in tissue are further imposed and shown to produce severe beam-forming artifacts. Two-dimensional phase aberration correction is applied and results indicate that the method is adequate to compensate for large phase excursions across the entire array. To fully realize the potential of large, two-dimensional, conformal arrays, proper two-dimensional phase aberration correction methods are necessary.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.368310","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/8433/00368310.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.368310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"73","endPage":"82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase aberration correction on two-dimensional conformal arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Phase aberration correction on two-dimensional conformal arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368310/","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4861841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase aberration correction on two-dimensional conformal arrays","sourcePdf":"368310.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037282S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"30","articleId":"368310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":368313,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

The small backplate pits which result from etching, provide well ordered and highly uniform air layers between the backplate surface and thin dielectric film. Such uniformity allows the transducers to be manufactured with reproducible characteristics (a property difficult to achieve through conventional manufacturing). Impulse response studies in generation and detection, have indicated well-damped, wideband behavior, with bandwidths extending from <100 kHz to 2.3 MHz (at the -6 dB points). These bandwidths are investigated as a function of excitation pulse width, applied bias potential, and dielectric film thickness.

The paper includes a number of example applications in which the analytical results are compared with lest results and with those obtained from conventional analysis based on Park's two axes machine model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.368336","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/8434/00368336.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.368336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","startPage":"717","endPage":"723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of an equivalent circuit approach to the analysis of synchronous machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of an equivalent circuit approach to the analysis of synchronous machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368336/","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4855415","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of an equivalent circuit approach to the analysis of synchronous machines","sourcePdf":"00368336.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036923S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"8434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"30","articleId":"368336","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":368337,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Early detection of interturn shorts during motor operation would eliminate consequential damage to adjacent coils and the stator core reducing repair costs and motor outage time. In addition to the benefits gained from early detection of turn insulation breakdown, significant advantages would accrue by locating the faulted coil within the stator winding. Fault location would not only increase the speed of the repair, but would also permit more optimal scheduling of the repair outage. This work was successful in practically implementing a theory to predict changes in the axial leakage flux resulting from stator winding interturn shorts and in developing an algorithm to locate the position of the faulted coil. An experimental setup consisting of a 200 hp motor loaded by a generator was used to validate this theory. Suitable transducers were developed and installed on this motor. Measurement using this experimental configuration clearly validated the theoretical model. On the basis of this experimental work an instrument to continuously monitor for shorted turns is under development.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/8434/00368345.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/60.368345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.368345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and location of interturn short circuits in the stator windings of operating motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Stator cores","Electric breakdown","Insulation","Circuit faults","Stator windings","Costs","Fault detection","Fault location","Optimal scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric motors","insulation testing","machine insulation","machine testing","electric breakdown","stators","fault location","failure analysis","magnetic flux","maintenance engineering","magnetic leakage","transducers","machine theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motors","interturn short circuits","stator windings","failure location","failure detection","turn insulation breakdown","stator core","repair","outage","faulted coil","winding","optimal scheduling","axial leakage flux","interturn shorts","algorithm","transducers","measurement","theoretical model","200 hp"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Detection and location of interturn short circuits in the stator windings of operating motors","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4855406","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and location of interturn short circuits in the stator windings of operating motors","sourcePdf":"00368345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028034S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"8434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"293","articleId":"368345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":368365,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the cumulative harmonic current characteristics of a large number of such loads. A complete analytical model for the most common load type is derived. This model is then used to investigate the impact of: (1) interaction due to a shared source impedance; (2) variation in power level; and (3) variations in circuit parameters, on individual and cumulative current harmonics. The key findings of the paper are that diversity and attenuation are very important factors in predicting the behavior of distributed single-phase power electronic loads, especially for the higher-order harmonics, and that due to these two factors, the commonly-used fixed current injection method, using arithmetic sums of harmonic current magnitudes, can significantly overestimate the cumulative harmonic currents produced by these loads.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4888321","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An investigation of harmonics attenuation and diversity among distributed single-phase power electronic loads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation of harmonics attenuation and diversity among distributed single-phase power electronic loads","sourcePdf":"00368365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031628S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"175","articleId":"368365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":368370,"authors":[{"name":"V.

A search technique is used where the search is guided by appropriate heuristics. The optimum solution entails finding the strategy which involves the operation of minimum number of switchgear for rerouting the supply within the constraint of specified loading. This is an essential requirement in countries like India where the circuit breakers are almost always manually operated and a number of transformers and feeders operate close to their rated capacity. It pays therefore to adopt different strategies at peak load and off peak conditions since the number of breaker operations is so critical. The heuristic search that is developed is applied to a large distribution system and provides very good results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.368370","startPage":"430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/8435/00368370.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.368370","endPage":"438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal restoration of power supply in large distribution systems in developing countries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368370/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimal restoration of power supply in large distribution systems in developing countries","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4888316","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal restoration of power supply in large distribution systems in developing countries","sourcePdf":"00368370.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069556S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"37","articleId":"368370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":368371,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Liang Chen","affiliation":["Scarborough Public Utilities Commission, Scarborough, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Rong-Liang Chen","id":"37653980700"},{"name":"K.

This paper discusses a new fault location system for multi-terminal single transmission lines. Asynchronous sampling at each terminal is preferred in order to simplify the transmission equipment and an algorithm for synchronizing the asynchronous sampling data is presented. Another algorithm is presented which converts the original multi-terminal system by progressively conversion to a system with one fewer terminals to arrive at a 2-terminal system containing the fault. An effective fault locating system can be constructed by combining these algorithms with existing reactive power locating operations.

The neural network was found to be capable of recognizing the differences in PD pulses produced by single cavity and electrical tree discharge sources. It also could differentiate between the discharge pulse forms emanating from electrical trees of different lengths; likewise, it was able to recognize changes in the shape of the discharge pulses with time due to aging effects. However, as these recognition capabilities relate only to comparisons of single discharge sources on a one-to-one basis, the application of neural networks to PD pulse shape recognition on actual power cables, where a number of different discharge sources may be discharging simultaneously, is quite premature at this time without more detailed exploratory work on complex discharge patterns.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.368411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/8435/00368411.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.368411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network system using the multi-layer perceptron technique for the recognition of PD pulse shapes due to cavities and electrical trees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368411/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network system using the multi-layer perceptron technique for the recognition of PD pulse shapes due to cavities and electrical trees","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4888275","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network system using the multi-layer perceptron technique for the recognition of PD pulse shapes due to cavities and electrical trees","sourcePdf":"00368411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065029S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"40","articleId":"368411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":368459,"authors":[{"name":"E.

However, the difficulties encountered with the simultaneous introduction of new services and new technologies often impede the accomplishment of set goals. A more prudent and feasible first step might well be to use the new technologies while following existing paradigms. Such a step will then facilitate the transition to new services that capitalize on the new technologies. Abiding by this principle, researchers at Stanford are developing a prototype on-line distance learning system based on recent advances in digital video compression, video servers, and multimedia networking to deliver live and stored video lectures and seminars to students at their desktops. For the sake of concreteness, we are designing this system with the Stanford University Instructional Television Network in mind, as a first step beyond existing video-based instructional services. The prototype system and extensions, however, are general enough to apply to other environments and application domains.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE MultiMedia","pdfPath":"/iel4/93/8442/00368609.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"93","publicationTitle":"IEEE MultiMedia","doi":"10.1109/93.368609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/93.368609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8442","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance learning with digital video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided instruction","Video compression","Network servers","Libraries","Multimedia systems","TV broadcasting","Computer science","Real time systems","Prototypes","Educational technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","multimedia communication","data compression","video coding","interactive video"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video","multimedia technologies","educational services paradigm","prototype on-line distance learning system","digital video compression","video servers","multimedia networking","video lectures","Stanford University Instructional Television Network","video-based instructional services"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Spring 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Spring 1995","displayDocTitle":"Distance learning with digital video","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Spring 1995","accessionNumber":"4929894","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance learning with digital video","sourcePdf":"00368609.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033971S","chronDate":"Spring 1995","isNumber":"8442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"93","citationCount":"39","articleId":"368609","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":368651,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The results are that, even when traffic is generated using different coding schemes, the number of cells per frame can be described by a gamma (or equivalently negative binomial) distribution and a DAR(1) model determined by three traffic parameters (the mean, variance, and correlation) can be used to accurately model the source. The main contribution of the paper is in showing that the authors' previously published results on source modeling and marginal distributions, which were based on analysis of traffic generated by one type of coder, hold for coders which differ in various ways and particularly differ in the use of motion compensation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368735","startPage":"1744","endPage":"1748 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368735.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling teleconference traffic from VBR video coders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Teleconferencing","Traffic control","Motion compensation","Discrete cosine transforms","Telecommunication traffic","Layout","Video coding","Video codecs","Delay","Videoconference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication traffic","motion compensation","teleconferencing","variable rate codes","packet switching","statistical analysis","video coding","video signal processing","image coding","discrete cosine transforms","gamma distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["teleconference traffic","VBR video coders","scene changes","video codecs","DCT","motion compensation","coding schemes","cells per frame","gamma distribution","negative binomial distribution","DAR(1) model","source modeling","marginal distributions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Modeling teleconference traffic from VBR video coders","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","accessionNumber":"4869445","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling teleconference traffic from VBR video coders","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035893S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"35","articleId":"368735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":368741,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The technique is suitable when the memory of the source induces a large trellis. This is typical when bandwidth efficient digital modulation systems are used. When the channel is power and bandwidth limited an efficient modulation scheme is needed. Continuous phase modulated signals can represent a solution but they involve an increase in the receiver complexity; and this factor becomes a severe limitation when a coded modulation is required. As a direct consequence, CPM schemes with both power and bandwidth efficient utilization, and a good overall performance in terms of error probability are expected to be much more expensive than traditional methods. The big problem of handling the increased memory in the use of complex coded/modulation schemes are caused first of all by the presence of the Viterbi detector in the receiver. Sequential decoding is a valid alternative, and particularly the backtracking algorithm. Purely breadth first sequential decoding algorithms such as M-algorithm and Stack algorithm are in fact simple to analyze and present inherent parallelism but are, as pointed out by Anderson (1992), less efficient in terms of average number of paths searched with respect to the backtracking algorithm. The aim of the paper is twofold. First, we propose a technique which is a modified version of a Fano-like (1963) algorithm in which the forward operations ore performed by means of a breadth first algorithm. Second, an important application of the algorithm in the coherent detection of continuous phase modulation is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368741","startPage":"1712","endPage":"1716 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368741.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backtracking sequential detection of continuous phase modulated signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Backtracking sequential detection of continuous phase modulated signals","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4869439","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368741/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backtracking sequential detection of continuous phase modulated signals","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054187S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"1","articleId":"368741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":368750,"authors":[{"name":"Guoping Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Denver, Denver, CO, USA"],"lastName":"Guoping Liu","id":"37087291236"},{"name":"K.Y.

Determination of the presence of such signals can be performed by radiometer-based intercept receivers that detect the signal's presence by measuring received power. However, conventional intercept receivers often fail when they operate in the presence of narrow-band interference because of their inability to differentiate between jammer and DSSS signal energy. An intercept receiver which employs wavelet transform domain-based excision is described. The receiver detects BPSK DSSS signals in the presence of narrow-band interference by employing adaptive interference rejection techniques to suppress the interference before measuring power. The improvement in the system performance over that of conventional radiometric detection only is shown by presenting numerical simulation results in the form of receiver operating characteristics. Performance is also compared to that for intercept receivers that use FFT-based excision systems techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368753.pdf","startPage":"1648","endPage":"1652 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiometric detection of direct-sequence spread spectrum signals with interference excision using the wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiometry","Spread spectrum communication","Interference suppression","Signal detection","Power measurement","Narrowband","Performance evaluation","Jamming","Wavelet domain","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","adaptive signal detection","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","radiometry","wavelet transforms","radio receivers","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct-sequence spread spectrum signals","interference excision","wavelet transform","radiometer-based intercept receivers","received power","intercept receiver","wavelet transform domain-based excision","BPSK","narrow-band interference","adaptive interference rejection","system performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Radiometric detection of direct-sequence spread spectrum signals with interference excision using the wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4869427","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiometric detection of direct-sequence spread spectrum signals with interference excision using the wavelet transform","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044119S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"5","articleId":"368753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":368754,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

Simulation results show that when the sampling rate is two samples per symbol the performance of our joint estimation algorithm approaches the performance of binary phase-shift-keying with perfect synchronization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Timing","Sampling methods","Frequency synchronization","Delay estimation","Phase estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Phase shift keying","Radio frequency","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronisation","minimum shift keying","maximum likelihood estimation","timing","matched filters","error statistics","signal sampling","estimation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum-likelihood timing estimation","maximum likelihood data estimation","MSK signals","matched-filter samples","joint likelihood function","data sequences","timing error","minimum shift keying signalling","free-running mode","sampling rate","lower bounds","error-probability","mean-square timing-error","optimum performance","simulation","joint estimation algorithm","binary phase-shift-keying","perfect synchronization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368767","startPage":"1566","endPage":"1570 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368767.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint maximum-likelihood timing and data estimation for MSK signals from matched-filter samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint maximum-likelihood timing and data estimation for MSK signals from matched-filter samples","accessionNumber":"4869413","publicationDate":"1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint maximum-likelihood timing and data estimation for MSK signals from matched-filter samples","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033014S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"1","articleId":"368767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":368768,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The use of both L-branch postdetection equal gain combining (EGC) and L-branch postdetection selection combining (SC) are considered. Two approaches for representing the cochannel interference are investigated. These are a Gaussian interference model and a synchronous interference model.

While maintaining the same precision, importance sampling (IS) techniques can substantially reduce this run time using MC simulation. To obtain these speed-up factors, the IS parameters specifying the simulation probability density function (pdf) must be carefully chosen. The authors present an IS technique for the efficient simulation of baseband communication systems characterized by a static channel and a recursive least square (RLS) linear adaptive equalizer in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). This IS technique is based on a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimisation algorithm.

While CDMA has been shown to offer a significant capacity advantage over narrowband TDMA, the gain is very sensitive to assumed propagation loss and cell size parameters. Accordingly, it is of interest to obtain a more accurate assessment of system efficiency and performance in potential macro, micro and pico cell environments. A discrete event simulation model has been developed for cellular packet CDMA with mixed voice/data traffic, and is used to obtain performance measures such as throughput, voice packet loss rate and data delay as a function of offered load. Using a realistic distance-dependent propagation loss model, it is shown that spatial reuse efficiency of the packet CDMA system varies significantly with cell size, decreasing by as much as a factor of 2 as cell size is reduced from 500 to 50 meters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368810","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368810.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","startPage":"805","endPage":"810 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic capacity of cellular packet CDMA for varying cell size and propagation scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Traffic capacity of cellular packet CDMA for varying cell size and propagation scenarios","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368810/","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4869384","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic capacity of cellular packet CDMA for varying cell size and propagation scenarios","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055713S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"2","articleId":"368810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":368811,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Typically nonlinear subsystems are originally described in terms of nonlinear differential equations (NLDE). Directly implementing the numerical solution of the NLDE into simulation block models can be computationally intensive as well as numerically unstable. We present here a simulation methodology that uses artificial neural networks (ANN) to build and efficiently simulate block models of nonlinear devices and subsystems within larger communication system models. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach and the validity of our analysis by showing significant run time savings in the simulation of an optical time-division multiple-access (OTDMA) architecture that involves a two input optoelectronic \"AND\" device.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368818","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368818.pdf","startPage":"763","endPage":"768 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks for modeling and simulation of communication systems with nonlinear devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks for modeling and simulation of communication systems with nonlinear devices","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4869376","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks for modeling and simulation of communication systems with nonlinear devices","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368818.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064949S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","articleId":"368818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":368840,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The bursty nature of the errors on the wireless channel requires careful control of transmission performance without unduly increasing the overhead for error protection. A dual-rate source coder is presented that adaptively selects a coding rate according to the current channel conditions. An ARQ (automatic repeat request) error control technique is employed to retransmit erroneous data-frames. The source coding rate is selected based on the occupancy level of the ARQ transmission buffer. Error detection followed by retransmission results in less overhead than forward error correction for the same quality.

Fractionally sampled data are cyclo-stationary rather than stationary. The problem is cast into a mathematical framework of a vector stationary process with single input (information sequence) and multiple outputs, by using a time-series representation of a cyclostationary process. This leads to number of subchannels equal to number of samples per symbol. Each subchannel is first equalized independently using a baud-rate CMA/Godard (1980) blind equalizer. Several approaches are presented for selection and fusion of the equalized outputs of the various subchannels in order to achieve a performance that is much less sensitive to the symbol-timing-phase errors when compared with a band-rate equalizer. An illustrative simulation example 16-QAM (V22 source) signal is presented where effect of symbol-timing-phase offset is studied via computer simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368844","endPage":"553 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368844.pdf","startPage":"549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel multimodel: CMA/Godard adaptive filter bank approach to fractionally-spaced blind adaptive equalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368844/","displayDocTitle":"A parallel multimodel: CMA/Godard adaptive filter bank approach to fractionally-spaced blind adaptive equalization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","accessionNumber":"4868931","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel multimodel: CMA/Godard adaptive filter bank approach to fractionally-spaced blind adaptive equalization","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0376S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"7","articleId":"368844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":368848,"authors":[{"name":"S.

By exploiting the structure of CCI signals, the proposed Bayesian DFE can distinguish an interfering signal from white noise and uses this information to improve performance. Adaptive implementation of this Bayesian DFE includes first using the standard least mean square (LMS) algorithm to identify the channel model and then estimating the co-channel states by means of a simple unsupervised clustering algorithm. Simulation involving a binary signal constellation is used to compare both the theoretical and adaptive performance of this Bayesian DFE with those of the maximum likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE). The results obtained indicate that, by compensating CCI the Bayesian DFE can outperform the MLSE for the CCI.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","startPage":"530","endPage":"533 vol.1","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368848.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Bayesian decision feedback equaliser incorporating co-channel interference compensation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Adaptive equalizers","Decision feedback equalizers","Radiofrequency interference","Maximum likelihood estimation","Clustering algorithms","Interchannel interference","White noise","Least squares approximation","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","adaptive equalisers","decision feedback equalisers","cochannel interference","least mean squares methods","adaptive signal detection","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Bayesian decision feedback equaliser","cochannel interference compensation","interfering signal","white noise","performance","standard least mean square algorithm","channel model","unsupervised clustering algorithm","binary signal constellation","maximum likelihood sequence estimator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Bayesian decision feedback equaliser incorporating co-channel interference compensation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368848/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4868927","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Bayesian decision feedback equaliser incorporating co-channel interference compensation","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034756S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"3","articleId":"368848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":368849,"authors":[{"name":"U.-C.

The authors define the bandwidth efficiency as the simultaneous number of users that can be supported per cell per MHz of bandwidth while achieving the specified grade of service. Variable rate voice sources are considered for all four systems with a peak rate of 9.6 kb/sec. The processing gain increases from 128 for the narrowband system to 1024 for the wideband. The uplink of the CDMA system under consideration uses convolutional codes, orthogonal signaling, fast closed-loop power control and multipath and antenna diversity with noncoherent combining. On the downlink, convolutional codes, BPSK modulation with pilot-assisted coherent reception, fast closed-loop power control and multipath diversity are employed. The downlink bandwidth efficiency of the 2.5, 5 and 10 MHz systems are higher than that of the 1.25 MHz system by about 30%, 60% and 90% for path loss exponent of 4. The bandwidth efficiency of the wideband systems is more pronounced for small path loss exponents. The same channel model was assumed in evaluating the bandwidth efficiency of the four systems.

Commercial digital cellular systems based on CDMA use stringent power control to combat near/far effects and fading.

Another interesting technique is a CDMA system with Rake-receiver. The main advantages of CDMA are well known, but its capacity is limited by multiuser interference. The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of a convolutionally-coded CDMA system combined with OFDM in a frequency/time selective fading channel, taking into account the near-far problem. This combination allows one to perform a maximum-likelihood detection (MLD), to use the available spectrum in an efficient way, to exploit frequency diversity and time diversity (provided by channel coding), and to retain many advantages of a CDMA system with a simpler hardware realization. An example for a mobile communication system using convolutionally-coded CDMA/OFDM with Walsh-Hadamard code-spreading for the downlink (base-mobile) is studied. The performance of a MLD is examined by taking into account the near-far problem. It is shown that the MLD is very robust to the near-far problem. It is also shown that by using BPSK modulation, in a 1.28 MHz bandwidth, one can transmit 64 active users at rate of about 10.34 kbit/sec.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368869","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368869.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","startPage":"1438","endPage":"1442 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of convolutionally coded CDMA/OFDM in a frequency-time selective fading channel and its near-far resistance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of convolutionally coded CDMA/OFDM in a frequency-time selective fading channel and its near-far resistance","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368869/","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858794","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of convolutionally coded CDMA/OFDM in a frequency-time selective fading channel and its near-far resistance","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025819S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"12","articleId":"368869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":368870,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Recent work has shown that the problem of acquisition may be the dominant factor limiting the capacity of DS/CDMA systems and networks. Passive matched filters and parallel search schemes have been shown to be able to acquire signals rapidly, but they do so at the cost of high or prohibitive complexity. In contrast, straight serial search schemes have lower complexity but acquire the signal much more slowly. In this paper, we present several hybrid active correlation schemes that provide flexibility in the trade-off between acquisition speed and complexity. These techniques test several phases concurrently, and either decide that a particular phase is correct, in which case the decision is verified by a binary hypothesis test, or it is decided that none of the phases are correct, in which case another group of phases is tested. Several fixed sample size (FSS) tests are considered, as well as a test based on a new M-ary sequential hypothesis test called the MSPRT. It is found that the MSPRT provides the best performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368870","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368870.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","startPage":"1433","endPage":"1437 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid acquisition schemes for direct sequence CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid acquisition schemes for direct sequence CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368870/","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858793","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid acquisition schemes for direct sequence CDMA systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02529S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"6","articleId":"368870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":368872,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

Noncoherent acquisition performance is of interest because the system can acquire before it achieves carrier phase lock, and parallel schemes are of interest because they significantly reduce acquisition time over serial schemes. The analysis presented is applicable to the reverse link (mobile to base station) of a mobile communications system which employs code division multiple access (CDMA). By deriving results for both long and short spreading sequences, it is also shown that the periodicity of the spreading sequences has a significant effect on acquisition performance. Finally, the issue of capacity determined by acquisition performance criteria is addressed. The results show that, under certain conditions, the capacity is limited by acquisition, thus indicating the importance of the acquisition problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent parallel acquisition in CDMA spread spectrum systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368872","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368872.pdf","startPage":"1422","endPage":"1426 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent parallel acquisition in CDMA spread spectrum systems","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858791","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent parallel acquisition in CDMA spread spectrum systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097022S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"16","articleId":"368872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":368874,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Technique (iii), although basically identical with technique (ii), is likely to suffer from side effects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368905.pdf","startPage":"1236","endPage":"1241 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal error protection for digital mobile DS-CDMA radio systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels","Phase shift keying","Frequency","Personal communication networks","Bandwidth","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential phase shift keying","fading","digital radio","code division multiple access","land mobile radio","channel coding","Rayleigh channels","synchronisation","asynchronous transfer mode","coding errors","error detection codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unequal error protection","digital mobile DS-CDMA radio systems","coded direct-sequence code-division multiple access","channel code rates","symbol energies","analytical approximations","bit error rate","correlated Rayleigh fading","carrier phase synchronization","binary PSK modulation","pilot-symbol-aided coherent detection","binary DPSK modulation","differential detection","asynchronous up-link","fast fading","side effects","code spreading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Unequal error protection for digital mobile DS-CDMA radio systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858758","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal error protection for digital mobile DS-CDMA radio systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044604S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"3","articleId":"368905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":368910,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The present research trend in personal communications is towards systems that, on the one hand, guarantee the maximum flexibility and the maximum exploitation of the scarce available band and, on the other hand, have a decentralized control whose advantages are largely highlighted in the literature. These are, in general, contrasting requirements since the decentralization of the control can entail a loss in flexibility and in efficiency caused by the partition of the resources among the entities charged for the control. The paper shows how the asynchronous CDMA technique can cope with the aforementioned problem and stresses the advantages inherent in the use of this technique. The various CDMA issues are applied to the L-band land mobile payload. In particular, the capacity of the satellite system achievable by using this payload is determined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368925.pdf","startPage":"1136","endPage":"1140 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on an asynchronous CDMA satellite system for personal communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Artificial satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Payloads","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Stress","Distributed control","Telecommunication traffic","Satellite ground stations","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","mobile satellite communication","personal communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous CDMA satellite system","personal communications","decentralized control","L-band land mobile payload"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Study on an asynchronous CDMA satellite system for personal communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858738","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on an asynchronous CDMA satellite system for personal communications","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03477S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"6","articleId":"368925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":368927,"authors":[{"name":"H.K.

A pilot symbol from a known sequence is multiplexed into the data symbols at regular intervals to form frames of symbols for transmission. Using the pilot symbols in two consecutive frames, the receiver is able to estimate and correct the fading distortion. The proposed technique uses a linear extrapolation approach that requires no storage of previous data symbols and introduces virtually zero delay to the received message. A series of computer-simulation tests has been carried out to assess the performance of the proposed technique on different signal constellations, including the 8 PSK, 16 PSK, 16 QAM and star-16 QAM signals, in the Rayleigh fading channels. The results have shown that significant improvements in bit-error rate performances of the systems can be achieved by the proposed technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368927.pdf","startPage":"1126","endPage":"1130 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pilot symbol-aided technique used for digital signals in multipath environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Phase shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Land mobile radio","Receivers","Extrapolation","Delay","Testing","Constellation diagram","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signals","digital radio","fading","time-varying channels","Rayleigh channels","multipath channels","error statistics","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","multiplexing","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot symbol-aided technique","digital signals","multipath environments","fading","multiplex","distortion","linear extrapolation","zero delay","received message","performance","signal constellation","8PSK","16PSK","16QAM","star-16QAM","Rayleigh fading","bit-error rate performances"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"A pilot symbol-aided technique used for digital signals in multipath environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858736","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pilot symbol-aided technique used for digital signals in multipath environments","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0403S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"25","articleId":"368927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":368928,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

Due to the specific nature of the multiplexing method for CDMA networks, the performance of transmission services depends on the number of active users in the network. Bit error rate formulae for voice and data calls are obtained as functions of the numbers of active voice and data calls. The blocking probability of voice calls is determined for a call access administration strategy with preemptive priority for voice calls. The improvement in the performance of data calls as a result of the application of ARQ techniques is examined. Formulae for the virtual transmission rate of data calls are derived. The article provides an approach to understanding the complex relationship between the grade of service and the number of active users in CDMA networks. Based on the results, a bandwidth management strategy is proposed for CDMA networks transporting multimedia services. In order to mitigate the congestion of data calls under fully loaded cell conditions, a throttling back rate reduction method is studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368931.pdf","startPage":"1104","endPage":"1110 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The grade of service for integrated voice/data wireless DS-CDMA networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bandwidth","Bit error rate","Interference","Telecommunication traffic","Time division multiple access","Laboratories","Data engineering","Automatic repeat request","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","voice communication","land mobile radio","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","radio networks","probability","automatic repeat request","telecommunication network management","performance evaluation","multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated voice/data wireless networks","DS-CDMA networks","multiplexing method","transmission services performance","bit error rate","voice calls","data calls","blocking probability","call access administration","preemptive priority","ARQ techniques","virtual transmission rate","grade of service","bandwidth management","multimedia services","loaded cell conditions","throttling back rate reduction method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"The grade of service for integrated voice/data wireless DS-CDMA networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858732","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The grade of service for integrated voice/data wireless DS-CDMA networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368931.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044077S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"25","articleId":"368931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":368939,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The considered digital receiver operates on samples of the complex envelope r(t) of the received signal, taken by a fixed clock which is not synchronized to the transmitter clock. The synchronized samples required for the symbol synchronization algorithm are computed by interpolating between the available non-synchronized samples. Because of finite memory, interpolation is non-ideal; hence, some amount of distortion is introduced, which affects the performance of the symbol synchronizer. By means of theoretical analysis, the authors investigate the tracking performance of a specific decision-directed feedback synchronizer, assuming interpolation of orders zero, one and two. They show that non-ideal interpolation gives rise to a loop noise spectrum containing spectral lines, that mainly occur near f=0 when the number of samples per symbol is close to an integer. Unless a sufficiently small loop bandwidth is chosen, the contribution of these spectral lines could dominate the timing error variance, which then becomes much larger than for synchronized sampling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","startPage":"929","endPage":"933 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368962.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368962","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Synchronization","Bandwidth","Clocks","Narrowband","Transmitters","Performance analysis","Feedback","Timing","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","synchronisation","tracking","spectral analysis","digital communication","modems","receivers","phase shift keying","electric distortion","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol synchronizer performance","fully digitally implemented receiver","narrowband MPSK signal","complex envelope","received signal","fixed clock","interpolation","distortion","tracking","specific decision-directed feedback synchronizer","loop noise spectrum","spectral lines","loop bandwidth","timing error variance","digital modems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Symbol synchronizer performance affected by non-ideal interpolation in digital modems","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858701","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368962/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol synchronizer performance affected by non-ideal interpolation in digital modems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368962.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035042S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"7","articleId":"368962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":368969,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

The recovery strategy uses the idea of multicopy retransmissions. It avoids buffer overflows, reduces the effect of the round trip delay and performs well in high speed satellite environments. The analysis uses a semi-Markov process model and includes a parameter in order to obtain the throughput as a function of the number of erroneous messages that may be processed and reordered during the recovery procedure. Numerical results show that the proposed strategy presents better performance than all the other known GB(N) schemes. Furthermore, the throughput efficiency remains in an usable range even for very high error rate conditions where it outperforms some finite buffer selective repeat schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368975","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368975.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"863 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A go-back-N protocol with multicopy retransmission for high speed satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368975/","displayDocTitle":"A go-back-N protocol with multicopy retransmission for high speed satellite communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858688","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A go-back-N protocol with multicopy retransmission for high speed satellite communications","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368975.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067296S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"5","articleId":"368975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":368978,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The data rates range from 1.6 Mbps half-duplex on long loops to 6 Mbps half-duplex on shorter loops. Thus far, several studies have been performed on the performance of different ADSL system architectures, but little attention has been paid to the wordlength requirements of the transceiver ASIC that is at the heart of an economical implementation. In this paper we focus on the adaptive equalizer block of the system proposed by Daneshrad and Samueli (1992). Results of studies are presented that show the minimum word lengths for the front-end analog-to-digital converter (A/D) as well as the different signals within the adaptive filters of the equalizer. For both the feedforward equalizer (FFE) and the decision feedback equalizer (DFE) wordlength requirements of four signals are studied (a) the filter input, (b) the multiply-accumulator at the output of the filter, (c) the number of bits required to store and update the adaptive coefficient, (d) the number of coefficient bits actually used in the filtering operation. It is found that a 10 bit A/D is sufficient for such a system, and that all other signals studied require no more than 22 bits of dynamic range. Armed with such information, the system designer can use the minimum word lengths without sacrificing system performance, while at the same time reducing the size, power consumption, and cost of the transceiver ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368979","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368979.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","startPage":"838","endPage":"842 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite wordlength requirements for adaptive signal processing elements in digital QAM ADSL systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite wordlength requirements for adaptive signal processing elements in digital QAM ADSL systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368979/","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4858684","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite wordlength requirements for adaptive signal processing elements in digital QAM ADSL systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368979.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059432S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"2","articleId":"368979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":368987,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A very effective solution, already experimented with digital audio broadcasting, is the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique with a guard interval. Unluckily such an interval grows from a few ten microseconds, sufficient for typical urban propagation environment, up to 600 microseconds, when the emerging single frequency network (SFN) is considered. A long guard interval (as required in a SFN) results in a excessive prolongation of the symbol period (T) and thus in bandwidth efficiency loss. In addition, the use of a too long symbol period is limited by the effects of time selectivity of the channel and by technological limitations. In this light, the use is suggested of a shorter guard interval and a low complexity equaliser at the output of each subcarrier to reduce the error produced by the echoes exceeding the guard interval duration. A multiresolution (MR) transmission scheme has been adopted in order to eliminate the sharp threshold effect in the fringes of the broadcast area. The system performances of a 2-resolution OFDM system have been evaluated by computer simulation on a frequency-selective channel for Rice and Rayleigh propagation environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368988","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368988.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","startPage":"374","endPage":"380 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM with guard interval and sub-channel equalization in a 2-resolution transmission scheme for digital television broadcasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=368988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDM with guard interval and sub-channel equalization in a 2-resolution transmission scheme for digital television broadcasting","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368988/","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4857963","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM with guard interval and sub-channel equalization in a 2-resolution transmission scheme for digital television broadcasting","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036141S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"21","articleId":"368988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":368991,"authors":[{"name":"D.

For instance, sites in the system are grouped into location areas that are used to find mobiles and terminate incoming calls. In this way, the system only needs to track the movement of users when they cross from one service area to another. Still, since the tracking is done using radio bandwidth that is needed for telephone calls, it is important to carefully design the service areas to minimize the mobility management load. The authors define the characteristics that are needed in the service areas for digital cellular systems and state the service area design problem as a graph partitioning optimization problem where the goal is to minimize the diameter of the resulting subgraphs. A heuristic technique is then proposed to design service areas in a systematic and efficient way. This technique achieves better utilization of system resources and produces service areas whose characteristics are close to optimal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.368996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.368996","startPage":"197","endPage":"200 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00368996.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to assign service areas in a cellular mobile telephone system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"How to assign service areas in a cellular mobile telephone system","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4857955","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/368996/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to assign service areas in a cellular mobile telephone system","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00368996.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032701S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"7","articleId":"368996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":369007,"authors":[{"name":"S.V.

The DMT system uses the inverse and forward discrete Fourier transform (DFT) for modulation and demodulation. An alternative to the classic DMT system is to substitute a discrete wavelet transform in place of the DFT as the modulating transform. This new method is called discrete wavelet multitone (DWMT) signaling, and has been shown to be superior to the DMT system in certain channel environments. This paper illustrates that the DMT system and the DWMT system are both based on the theory of M-band wavelet filter banks. In particular, DMT and DWMT are linked formally through a discussion of digital multirate filter hanks and digital transmultiplexer. In addition the advantages of wavelet transform-based transmultiplexers over DFT-based transmultiplexers are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DMT systems, DWMT systems and digital filter banks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.369039","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00369039.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"315 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.369039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=369039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/369039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"DMT systems, DWMT systems and digital filter banks","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4851263","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DMT systems, DWMT systems and digital filter banks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00369039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081868S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","citationCount":"41","articleId":"369039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":369042,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.G.

First, an optimum method for decoding correlated sequences is derived and it is shown to require Viterbi decoding. Then, a modified MAP method (MMAP) for Markov sequences is described. A maximal signal-to-noise (MSNR) receiver for DPCM systems is also developed that minimizes the distortion power due to channel errors; the appropriate cost matrix for this receiver is computed. These methods are applied to DPCM picture transmission over noisy channels and are compared to a recent method. The SNR graphs and the subjective examination of the enhanced pictures demonstrate that the proposed procedures are quite effective and are superior to a recent method. The MSNR receiver was found to be somewhat more effective than the MMAP receiver for a given order of the Markov source. The Markov modelling of the encoded signal is found to improve the SNR of the received pictures. Furthermore, it is observed that the gain increases with the increase in the order of the Markov model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1994.369054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1994.369054","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM'94 - 1994 International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/2977/8446/00369054.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"234 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/369054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Efficient decoding of correlated sources with application to DPCM image coding","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1994","accessionNumber":"4851248","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient decoding of correlated sources with application to DPCM image coding","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00369054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033674S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1994","isNumber":"8446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2977","articleId":"369054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":369135,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Chan Chin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Cheng-Shiu Junior College of Technology and Commerce, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hong-Chan Chin","id":"37087354508"},{"name":"Whei-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Whei-Min Lin","id":"37087145295"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"369135","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Voltage","Fuzzy sets","Circuits","Power capacitors","Cost function","Reactive power","Power system modeling","Energy loss","Dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","fuzzy set theory","sensitivity","optimisation","capacitors","circuit layout","voltage control","current limiting reactors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy algorithm","capacitor placement","distribution circuit","membership functions","voltage sensitivity","real power loss","optimal locations","exhaustive search","fuzzy-set optimization problem","capacitor cost","voltage-limiting constraints","distribution feeder"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitor placements for distribution systems with fuzzy algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=369135","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1994.369135","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1029 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON'94 - 1994 IEEE Region 10's 9th Annual International Conference on: 'Frontiers of Computer Technology'","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON'94 - 1994 IEEE Region 10's 9th Annual International Conference on: 'Frontiers of Computer Technology'","pdfPath":"/iel2/2978/8447/00369135.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1994.369135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8447","abstract":"Presents a fuzzy-based approach for capacitor placement in a distribution circuit.

Assuming a peer-to-peer type but with a base station for power control, each unit can communicate directly and the near-far effect is eliminated. Packets are convolutionally encoded before modulation. The receiver has a hard-decision decoder using a modified Viterbi decoding algorithm, and may decide to request retransmission under a threshold criterion of the algorithm. The network is modeled with several interactive continuous-time absorbing Markov chains. Degradation of throughput may be expected but this can be reasonably controlled by adjusting the threshold level. This hybrid scheme offers a more flexible set of parameters from which individual users can choose, thus it can be customized to fit the individual reliability level needs for each receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1994.369234","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON'94 - 1994 IEEE Region 10's 9th Annual International Conference on: 'Frontiers of Computer Technology'","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON'94 - 1994 IEEE Region 10's 9th Annual International Conference on: 'Frontiers of Computer Technology'","pdfPath":"/iel2/2978/8447/00369234.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1994.369234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8447","startPage":"581","endPage":"586 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel error control scheme for CDMA wireless LANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=369234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel error control scheme for CDMA wireless LANs","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/369234/","conferenceDate":"22-26 Aug. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4847747","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel error control scheme for CDMA wireless LANs","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00369234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045913S","chronDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2978","citationCount":"3","articleId":"369234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":369236,"authors":[{"name":"Tai Hyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tai Hyun Kim","id":"38240447000"},{"name":"Young Yearl Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young Yearl Han","id":"37351318400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"369236","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Multipath channels","Multiaccess communication","Pulse modulation","Arm","Pulse shaping methods","Signal resolution","Bit error rate","Statistics","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cellular radio","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","RAKE receiver","closed form expressions","statistical problem","pdf","exponentially distributed random variables","order statistics","power controlled single cell CDMA system","resolvable paths"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents closed form expressions for calculating the performance of a practical RAKE receiver. To solve the statistical problem encountered when deriving the performance, the pdf of Z/sub L/ was first derived, which was defined as the sum of the largest /spl mu/ samples among L identically and exponentially distributed random variables, by invoking order statistics. Using the pdf of Z/sub L/, the average BER of the power controlled single cell CDMA system was obtained The results show that the performance improves as the number of PN correlators, /spl mu/ increases. However as the number of /spl mu/ increases one by one, the performance improvement becomes narrower and narrower. Finally, we can also find that performance improves as the number of resolvable paths of channel increases at the same fixed number of correlators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1994.369236","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON'94 - 1994 IEEE Region 10's 9th Annual International Conference on: 'Frontiers of Computer Technology'","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON'94 - 1994 IEEE Region 10's 9th Annual International Conference on: 'Frontiers of Computer Technology'","pdfPath":"/iel2/2978/8447/00369236.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"580 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1994.369236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of RAKE receiver for cellular CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=369236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/369236/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of RAKE receiver for cellular CDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4847745","conferenceDate":"22-26 Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of RAKE receiver for cellular CDMA systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00369236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046424S","chronDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2978","articleId":"369236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":369245,"authors":[{"name":"Lunji Qiu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Lunji Qiu","id":"37350684200"},{"name":"Haiyun Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Haiyun Yang","id":"37349478700"},{"name":"Soo Ngee Koh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Soo Ngee Koh","id":"37283913800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"369245","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Signal detection","Fourier transforms","Frequency estimation","Wavelet transforms","Speech processing","Signal processing algorithms","Power harmonic filters","Signal design","Amplitude estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech processing","signal processing","frequency estimation","harmonics","fast Fourier transforms","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fundamental frequency detector","speech signal processing","wavelet transform","short-time Fourier transform","harmonics elimination","harmonics attenuation","peak amplitude estimation","short-time spectrum","accurate fundamental frequency estimation"]}],"abstract":"The design of an accurate speech fundamental frequency detector is one of the most challenging areas of speech signal processing research. A new fundamental frequency determination method for speech signals is presented in this paper. This new method is based on a wavelet transform followed by a short-time Fourier transform. The wavelet transform is used to eliminate and attenuate the harmonics of the speech signals. The fundamental frequency of the speech signals is determined by estimating the peak amplitude of the short-time spectrum of the wavelet-transformed speech signals. The new method is not only effective for accurate fundamental frequency estimation but it also does not have the problem of occasional incorrect frequency estimation, such as frequency doubling or halving, usually associated with the conventional methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1994.369245","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON'94 - 1994 IEEE Region 10's 9th Annual International Conference on: 'Frontiers of Computer Technology'","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON'94 - 1994 IEEE Region 10's 9th Annual International Conference on: 'Frontiers of Computer Technology'","pdfPath":"/iel2/2978/8447/00369245.pdf","startPage":"526","endPage":"530 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1994.369245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fundamental frequency detector of speech signals based on short time Fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=369245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/369245/","displayDocTitle":"A fundamental frequency detector of speech signals based on short time Fourier transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4846472","conferenceDate":"22-26 Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fundamental frequency detector of speech signals based on short time Fourier transform","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00369245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051798S","chronDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2978","articleId":"369245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":369290,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Liang Wang","id":"37068528500"},{"name":"Yu-Tai Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Tai Chang","id":"37350433000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1862-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"369290","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Discrete cosine transforms","Computer architecture","Systolic arrays","Throughput","Matrix decomposition","Hardware","Two dimensional displays","Discrete transforms","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systolic arrays","VLSI","discrete cosine transforms","communication complexity","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly parallel VLSI architecture","2D DCT computation","IDCT computation","systolic array","matrix transposition hardware","two-dimensional discrete cosine transform","row-column decomposition","multipliers","regularity","modularity","VLSI implementation","pipelined regular architectures","area-time complexity","communication complexity","inverse discrete cosine transform","simulation","fixed-point error performance","real image data","random data","throughput rates"]}],"abstract":"A new systolic array without matrix transposition hardware is proposed to compute the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (2-D DCT) based on the row-column decomposition. This architecture uses N/sup 2/ multipliers to evaluate N/spl times/N-point DCT's at a rate of one complete transform per N clock cycles, where N is even. It possesses the features of regularity and modularity, and is thus well suited to VLSI implementation. As compared to existing pipelined regular architectures for the 2-D DCT, the proposed one has better throughput performance, smaller area-time complexity, and lower communication complexity. The new idea for the 2-D DCT is also extended to derive a similar systolic array for the 2-D inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 2-D DCT and IDCT architectures have good fixed-point error performance for both real image and random data. As a consequence, they are useful for applications where very high throughput rates are required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly parallel VLSI architectures for the 2-D DCT and IDCT computations","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON'94 - 1994 IEEE Region 10's 9th Annual International Conference on: 'Frontiers of Computer Technology'","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1994.369290","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON'94 - 1994 IEEE Region 10's 9th Annual International Conference on: 'Frontiers of Computer Technology'","pdfPath":"/iel2/2978/8447/00369290.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"299 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1994.369290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=369290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/369290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Highly parallel VLSI architectures for the 2-D DCT and IDCT computations","conferenceDate":"22-26 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4846427","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly parallel VLSI architectures for the 2-D DCT and IDCT computations","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00369290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044599S","chronDate":"22-26 Aug 1994","isNumber":"8447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"2978","articleId":"369290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":369448,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Because the number of operations required to execute a particular ATR algorithm can vary greatly from one scenario to another; a fixed hardware and software architecture will usually not be able to execute a given ATR algorithm in all required scenarios within some given real-time constraints. A solution to this problem is to use a scalable architecture. The hardware and software of such an architecture can easily be scaled to meet the processing requirements of a particular scenario.

Fog-related accidents are numerous, and canceled take-offs and landings due to fog and low visibility conditions (Cat III) have significant economic impact on airlines, parcel carriers and general aviation. Millimeter waves have good propagation properties in weather and give adequate spatial resolution when used to image the forward scene. Passive millimeter wave focal plane array cameras are new sensors which, integrated into future guidance and landing systems, promise to be an effective aid, or alternative, to existing technology for aircraft landings and take-offs under Cat III conditions. They can produce visual-like radiometric images at real time frame rates (30 Hz), which can be directly fused with infrared and visible images.
