The problem of determining the maximum surface measure of a {0}-avoiding set was first stated in a 1974 note by Witsenhausen; there the upper bound of \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1/n$</tex>\n times the surface measure of the sphere is derived from a simple averaging argument. A consequence of the Frankl\u2013Wilson theorem is that this fraction decreases exponentially, but until now the 1/3 upper bound for the case n=\u20093 has not moved. We improve this bound to 0.313 using an approach inspired by Delsarte's linear programming bounds for codes, combined with some combinatorial reasoning.

This paper explores domain randomization, a simple technique for training models on simulated images that transfer to real images by randomizing rendering in the simulator. With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to the model as just another variation. We focus on the task of object localization, which is a stepping stone to general robotic manipulation skills. We find that it is possible to train a real-world object detector that is accurate to 1.5 cm and robust to distractors and partial occlusions using only data from a simulator with non-realistic random textures. To demonstrate the capabilities of our detectors, we show they can be used to perform grasping in a cluttered environment. To our knowledge, this is the first successful transfer of a deep neural network trained only on simulated RGB images (without pre-training on real images) to the real world for the purpose of robotic control.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8202133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8202133","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08202133.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domain randomization for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Domain randomization for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8202133/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428700","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8202133/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain randomization for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093872S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"331","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8202133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8202134,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Tai","affiliation":["ECE, the HKUST","MBE, City University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Tai","id":"37086024718"},{"name":"Giuseppe Paolo","affiliation":["D-MAVT, ETH Zurich"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Paolo","id":"37086298025"},{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["ECE, the HKUST"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085398677"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8202134","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":158,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6018},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Navigation","Training","Robot kinematics","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","control engineering computing","laser ranging","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","navigation","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mapless motion planner","nonholonomic mobile robot","Continuous control","mapless navigation","10-dimensional range findings","mobile ground robots","laser range sensor","obstacle map","navigation environment","asynchronous deep reinforcement learning method","Virtual-to-real deep reinforcement learning","continuous steering commands"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8202134","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08202134.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8202134","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8202134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual-to-real deep reinforcement learning: Continuous control of mobile robots for mapless navigation","abstract":"We present a learning-based mapless motion planner by taking the sparse 10-dimensional range findings and the target position with respect to the mobile robot coordinate frame as input and the continuous steering commands as output.

However, training a policy that generalizes well across a wide range of real-world conditions requires far greater quantity and diversity of experience than is practical to collect with a single robot. Fortunately, it is possible for multiple robots to share their experience with one another, and thereby, learn a policy collectively. In this work, we explore distributed and asynchronous policy learning as a means to achieve generalization and improved training times on challenging, real-world manipulation tasks. We propose a distributed and asynchronous version of guided policy search and use it to demonstrate collective policy learning on a vision-based door opening task using four robots. We describe how both policy learning and data collection can be conducted in parallel across multiple robots, and present a detailed empirical evaluation of our system. Our results indicate that distributed learning significantly improves training time, and that parallelizing policy learning and data collection substantially improves utilization. We also demonstrate that we can achieve substantial generalization on a challenging real-world door opening task.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8202141","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08202141.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8202141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8202141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collective robot reinforcement learning with distributed asynchronous guided policy search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Collective robot reinforcement learning with distributed asynchronous guided policy search","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8202141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8202141/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428766","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collective robot reinforcement learning with distributed asynchronous guided policy search","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067882S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8202141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":8202149,"authors":[{"name":"Siyuan Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Siyuan","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086249096"},{"name":"Wenzhen Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenzhen","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085486405"},{"name":"Edward H.

The network achieved an overall accuracy of 88.4% while predicting the failure class with an accuracy of 92.7%.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8202170","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08202170.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8202170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8202170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grasp stability assessment through the fusion of proprioception and tactile signals using convolutional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8202170/","displayDocTitle":"Grasp stability assessment through the fusion of proprioception and tactile signals using convolutional neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8202170/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428470","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grasp stability assessment through the fusion of proprioception and tactile signals using convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05898S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8202170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8202172,"authors":[{"name":"Yanran Ding","affiliation":["department of Mechanical Science and Engineering Department, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yanran","lastName":"Ding","id":"37086268690"},{"name":"Hae-Won Park","affiliation":["department of Mechanical Science and Engineering Department, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Hae-Won","lastName":"Park","id":"37086265865"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8202172","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1817},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Actuators","Legged locomotion","Force","Knee","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","gait analysis","legged locomotion","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speed potential","electromagnetic motor torque","leg length","maximum vertical jumping height","leg prototype","motor/gearbox pair","mechanical design","optimal ground reaction force","control design","nonlinear optimization process","jumping applications","actuator design","optimized jumping","quasidirect-drive leg","experimental implementation","size 0.62 m","size 0.72 m"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8202172","abstract":"This paper introduces a novel method for actuator design that exploits electromagnetic motors' torque and speed potential in jumping applications.

An ongoing challenge for soft robots has been incorporating flexible sensors that can recognize complex motions and close the loop for tactile sensing. We present sensor skins that enable haptic object visualization when integrated on a soft robotic gripper that can twist an object. First, we investigate how the design of the actuator modules impact bend angle and motion. Each soft finger is molded using a silicone elastomer, and consists of three pneumatic chambers which can be inflated independently to achieve a range of complex motions. Three fingers are combined to form a soft robotic gripper. Then, we manufacture and attach modular, flexible sensory skins on each finger to measure deformation and contact. These sensor measurements are used in conjunction with an analytical model to construct 2D and 3D tactile object models. Our results are a step towards soft robot grippers capable of a complex range of motions and proprioception, which will help future robots better understand the environments with which they interact, and has the potential to increase physical safety in human-robot interaction.

Nevertheless, such tools typically require a large amount of training data and significant manual effort to label objects. This limits their applicability in robotics, where solutions must scale to a large number of objects and variety of conditions. This work proposes an autonomous process for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection and pose estimation in robotic setups. The focus is on detecting objects placed in cluttered, tight environments, such as a shelf with multiple objects. In particular, given access to 3D object models, several aspects of the environment are physically simulated. The models are placed in physically realistic poses with respect to their environment to generate a labeled synthetic dataset. To further improve object detection, the network self-trains over real images that are labeled using a robust multi-view pose estimation process. The proposed training process is evaluated on several existing datasets and on a dataset collected for this paper with a Motoman robotic arm. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms popular training processes relying on synthetic - but not physically realistic - data and manual annotation. The key contributions are the incorporation of physical reasoning in the synthetic data generation process and the automation of the annotation process over real images.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

Existing approaches that tackle the problem of semantic motion segmentation consist of long multistage pipelines and typically require several seconds to process each frame. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network architecture that learns to predict both the object label and motion status of each pixel in an image. Given a pair of consecutive images, the network learns to fuse features from self-generated optical flow maps and semantic segmentation kernels to yield pixel-wise semantic motion labels. We also introduce the Cityscapes-Motion dataset which contains over 2,900 manually annotated semantic motion labels, which is the largest dataset of its kind so far. We demonstrate that our network outperforms existing approaches achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset, as well as in the more challenging Cityscapes-Motion dataset while being substantially faster than existing techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8202211/","accessionNumber":"17428818","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8202211/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SMSnet: Semantic motion segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMSnet: Semantic motion segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08495S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8202211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":8202213,"authors":[{"name":"Lingni Ma","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Lingni","lastName":"Ma","id":"38553647800"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg St\u00fcckler","affiliation":["Computer Vision Group, RWTH Aachen University"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"St\u00fcckler","id":"37295983800"},{"name":"Christian Kerl","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Kerl","id":"37077774600"},{"name":"Daniel Cremers","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Cremers","id":"37282875300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8202213","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1479},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Image segmentation","Training","Three-dimensional displays","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Fuses","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image colour analysis","image fusion","image segmentation","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","robot vision","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-view baselines","end-to-end trained network","single-view segmentation","multiview semantic fusion","RGB-D cameras","visual scene understanding","deep neural network approach","RGB-D sequences","multiview consistent semantics","semantics predictions","semantic keyframe maps","network architecture","deep learning approach","depth fusion","semantic object-class segmentation","multiscale loss minimization","RGB-D images","multiview consistency training","semantic mapping","camera trajectory","RGB-D SLAM","Multiview deep learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8202213","abstract":"Visual scene understanding is an important capability that enables robots to purposefully act in their environment.

At test time, its semantics predictions can be fused more consistently in semantic keyframe maps than predictions of a network trained on individual views. We base our network architecture on a recent single-view deep learning approach to RGB and depth fusion for semantic object-class segmentation and enhance it with multi-scale loss minimization. We obtain the camera trajectory using RGB-D SLAM and warp the predictions of RGB-D images into ground-truth annotated frames in order to enforce multi-view consistency during training. At test time, predictions from multiple views are fused into keyframes. We propose and analyze several methods for enforcing multi-view consistency during training and testing.

Existing research can be roughly divided into correlation based approaches e.g. scan-to-submap matching and feature based methods e.g. bag-of-words (BoW). In this paper, we solve loop closure detection and relative pose transformation using 2D LiDAR within an end-to-end Deep Learning framework. The algorithm is verified with simulation data and on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flying in indoor environment. The loop detection ConvNet alone achieves an accuracy of 98.2% in loop closure detection. With a verification step using the scan matching ConvNet, the false positive rate drops to around 0.001%.

In this paper, raw point cloud normals are fed into the Point Convolution Network (PCN) without any other representation converts. The point cloud set disordered and unstructured problems are tackled by Kd-tree-based local permutation and spatial commutative pooling strategies proposed in this paper. Experiments on ModelNet illustrate that our method has two orders of magnitude less floating point computation in each non-linear mapping layer while it contributes to significant classification accuracy improvement.

To simulate a satellite servicing task, the gripper was mounted on a 7-DoF robot arm and performed a supervised grasp, manipulate, and release sequence on a hanging, Al-coated PET film.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An electrostatic gripper for flexible objects","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8202289","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08202289.pdf","startPage":"1172","endPage":"1179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8202289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8202289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8202289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An electrostatic gripper for flexible objects","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8202289/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428704","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An electrostatic gripper for flexible objects","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075807S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8202289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8202305,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Schenk","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision (ICG), Graz University of Technology, Styria, Austria"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Schenk","id":"37086331256"},{"name":"Friedrich Fraundorfer","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision (ICG), Graz University of Technology, Styria, Austria"],"firstName":"Friedrich","lastName":"Fraundorfer","id":"37266352400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8202305","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":530},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8202305","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Cameras","Tracking","Robustness","Feature extraction","Optimization","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","distance measurement","edge detection","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","pose estimation","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["standard edge detection methods","photo-consistency assumption","sparse edge representation","larger convergence basin","standard benchmark sequences","machine-learned edges","real-time robust edge","visual odometry framework","RGBD sensors","edge detection algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we present a real-time robust edge-based visual odometry framework for RGBD sensors (REVO). Even though our method is independent of the edge detection algorithm, we show that the use of state-of-the-art machine-learned edges gives significant improvements in terms of robustness and accuracy compared to standard edge detection methods. In contrast to approaches that heavily rely on the photo-consistency assumption, edges are less influenced by lighting changes and the sparse edge representation offers a larger convergence basin while the pose estimates are also very fast to compute. Further, we introduce a measure for tracking quality, which we use to determine when to insert a new key frame. We show the feasibility of our system on real-world datasets and extensively evaluate on standard benchmark sequences to demonstrate the performance in a wide variety of scenes and camera motions. Our framework runs in real-time on the CPU of a laptop computer and is available online.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8202305","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08202305.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1304","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8202305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust edge-based visual odometry using machine-learned edges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust edge-based visual odometry using machine-learned edges","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8202305/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17418368","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8202305/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust edge-based visual odometry using machine-learned edges","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124274S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8202305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8202312,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Fan Chen","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yu Fan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085513004"},{"name":"Michael Everett","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Everett","id":"37418751400"},{"name":"Miao Liu","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the stochasticity in people's behaviors. Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8202312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8202312/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428521","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Socially aware motion planning with deep reinforcement learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Socially aware motion planning with deep reinforcement learning","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0926.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062341S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8202312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":8202315,"authors":[{"name":"Helen Oleynikova","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Helen","lastName":"Oleynikova","id":"37085472384"},{"name":"Zachary Taylor","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Zachary","lastName":"Taylor","id":"37085581231"},{"name":"Marius Fehr","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Fehr","id":"37085807555"},{"name":"Roland Siegwart","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Siegwart","id":"37281398300"},{"name":"Juan Nieto","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Nieto","id":"37085778635"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8202315","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1755},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Three-dimensional displays","Robot sensing systems","Real-time systems","Buildings","Surface reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","collision avoidance","computer graphics","control engineering computing","distance measurement","image reconstruction","mesh generation","mobile robots","optimisation","robot vision","SLAM (robots)","solid modelling","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Euclidean Signed Distance Fields","on-board MAV","MicroAerial Vehicles","MAVs","unstructured environments","unexplored environments","flexible local planning","trajectory optimization methods","obstacle distance information","ESDFs","Truncated Signed Distance Fields","TSDFs","implicit surface representation","trajectory optimization","incremental 3D","computer graphics","computer vision","surface meshes","open source","single CPU core"]}],"abstract":"Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) that operate in unstructured, unexplored environments require fast and flexible local planning, which can replan when new parts of the map are explored. Trajectory optimization methods fulfill these needs, but require obstacle distance information, which can be given by Euclidean Signed Distance Fields (ESDFs). We propose a method to incrementally build ESDFs from Truncated Signed Distance Fields (TSDFs), a common implicit surface representation used in computer graphics and vision. TSDFs are fast to build and smooth out sensor noise over many observations, and are designed to produce surface meshes. We show that we can build TSDFs faster than Octomaps, and that it is more accurate to build ESDFs out of TSDFs than occupancy maps. Our complete system, called voxblox, is available as open source and runs in real-time on a single CPU core. We validate our approach on-board an MAV, by using our system with a trajectory optimization local planner, entirely on-board and in real-time.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8202315","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08202315.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8202315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","startPage":"1366","endPage":"1373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voxblox: Incremental 3D Euclidean Signed Distance Fields for on-board MAV planning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8202315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Voxblox: Incremental 3D Euclidean Signed Distance Fields for on-board MAV planning","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8202315/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428439","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8202315/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voxblox: Incremental 3D Euclidean Signed Distance Fields for on-board MAV planning","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054969S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8202315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8202718,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshinori Yonekura","firstName":"Yoshinori","lastName":"Yonekura"},{"name":"Yu Saito","firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Saito"},{"name":"Koichiro Sugiyama","firstName":"Koichiro","lastName":"Sugiyama"},{"name":"Kang Lou Soon","firstName":"Kang Lou","lastName":"Soon"},{"name":"Munetake Momose","firstName":"Munetake","lastName":"Momose"},{"name":"Masayoshi Yokosawa","firstName":"Masayoshi","lastName":"Yokosawa"},{"name":"Hideo Ogawa","firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Ogawa"},{"name":"Kimihiro Kimura","firstName":"Kimihiro","lastName":"Kimura"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Abe","firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Abe"},{"name":"Atsushi Nishimura","firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Nishimura"},{"name":"Yutaka Hasegawa","firstName":"Yutaka","lastName":"Hasegawa"},{"name":"Kenta Fujisawa","firstName":"Kenta","lastName":"Fujisawa"},{"name":"Tomoaki Ohyama","firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Ohyama"},{"name":"Yusuke Kono","firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Kono"},{"name":"Yusuke Miyamoto","firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Miyamoto"},{"name":"Satoko Sawada-Satoh","firstName":"Satoko","lastName":"Sawada-Satoh"},{"name":"Hideyuki Kobayashi","firstName":"Hideyuki","lastName":"Kobayashi"},{"name":"Noriyuki Kawaguchi","firstName":"Noriyuki","lastName":"Kawaguchi"},{"name":"Mareki Honma","firstName":"Mareki","lastName":"Honma"},{"name":"Katsunori M.

Writes within a cache set are governed by the access pattern as well as replacement policies, leading to a large write variation. This variation is of concern as it leads to early breakdown of the NVM cells due to large writes thus reducing the effective lifetime. This paper presents a technique to improve the lifetime of non-volatile caches by reducing the inter-set write variation. Our policy partitions the cache sets into groups called fellow groups. Every set has two logical parts: Normal and Reserved. Sets within a fellow group can use the reserved parts from their fellow sets to distribute the writes uniformly. Experimental results using full system simulation show that the proposed technique shows significant reduction in inter-set write variation over the baseline and existing technique.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2017.8203453","publicationTitle":"2017 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168766/8203442/08203453.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2017.8203453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Targeting inter set write variation to improve the lifetime of non-volatile cache using fellow sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Targeting inter set write variation to improve the lifetime of non-volatile cache using fellow sets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203453/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17431109","htmlLink":"/document/8203453/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Targeting inter set write variation to improve the lifetime of non-volatile cache using fellow sets","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"MS3A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048397S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168766","isNumber":"8203442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168766","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8203442","articleId":"8203453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203455,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Xue","affiliation":["University of Delaware, Newark, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xue","id":"37085373930"},{"name":"Abraham Mcllvaine","affiliation":["University of Delaware, Newark, USA"],"firstName":"Abraham","lastName":"Mcllvaine","id":"37086299113"},{"name":"Chengmo Yang","affiliation":["University of Delaware, Newark, USA"],"firstName":"Chengmo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37597788000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2879-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2881-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"}],"articleNumber":"8203455","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Encoding","Nonvolatile memory","Random access memory","Hardware","Table lookup","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","field programmable gate arrays","finite state machines","flip-flops","graph theory","magnetic tunnelling","random-access storage","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic power","dominant power factor","NVM elements","NVM cells","high write energy","finite state machines","encoding graph conflict","hardware efficient encoding algorithm","leakage power","flip-flops","magnetic tunnel junctions","power-aware encoding","cost-efficient state encoding","nonvolatile memory-based FPGA","transition graph model","graph conflict removing algorithm","state transition bit flips"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NVM-based FPGA","state encoding","low-power design","logic synthesis"]}],"abstract":"Non-volatile memory (NVM)-based FPGAs are expected to replace traditional SRAM-based FPGAs to achieve higher scalability, lower leakage power, and better reliability. In NVM-based FPGAs, dynamic power is the dominant power factor, and flip-flops exhibit the most intensive switching activities. While flip-flops can be implemented with NVM elements such as Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJ), NVM cells suffer from high write energy, making it necessary to reduce dynamic power by minimizing bit flips. Furthermore, flip-flops are used to implement finite state machines, whose power and hardware cost are largely determined by state encoding. In this work, a new state encoding algorithm is proposed to reduce bit flips during state transitions within limited number of flip-flops. The proposed scheme, consisting of a transition graph model, an encoding graph conflict removing algorithm and a hardware efficient encoding algorithm, is able to reduce flip-flops used by 85% and reduce state transition bit flips by 41.1% compared with existing popular encoding solutions.","publicationTitle":"2017 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168766/8203442/08203455.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-aware and cost-efficient state encoding in non-volatile memory based FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2017.8203455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2017.8203455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Power-aware and cost-efficient state encoding in non-volatile memory based FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17431080","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203455/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-aware and cost-efficient state encoding in non-volatile memory based FPGAs","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"MS3A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05953S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168766","isNumber":"8203442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168766","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8203442","articleId":"8203455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203456,"authors":[{"name":"George Michael","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Michael","id":"38232270000"},{"name":"Nectarios Efstathiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"],"firstName":"Nectarios","lastName":"Efstathiou","id":"37086327499"},{"name":"Kyriacos Mantis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"],"firstName":"Kyriacos","lastName":"Mantis","id":"37086329906"},{"name":"Theocharis Theocharides","affiliation":["KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"],"firstName":"Theocharis","lastName":"Theocharides","id":"37274607000"},{"name":"Danilo Pau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Pau","id":"37086327837"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2879-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2881-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"}],"articleNumber":"8203456","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":539},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203456","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drones","Rotors","Real-time systems","Neural networks","Training","Intelligent sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","autonomous aerial vehicles","barometers","compasses","gyroscopes","neurocontrollers","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightweight embedded processing board","turbulent situations","multirotor UAV","barometer","gyroscope","drone safety","reaction-time window","artificial neural network","pilot","low-power","intelligent power","accelerometer","compass","on-board sensors","integrated intelligent motor controller","inexperienced pilots","turbulent winds","unforeseen flight incidents","technical problems","fail-safe mechanisms","society","lifestyle","diverse entrance","powerful entrance","disaster management","entertainment","commercial multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles","constant technological advancements","multirotor unmanned aircraft systems","motor control","real-time ANN"]}],"abstract":"Constant technological advancements in commercial multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) resulted in their deployment in more and more applications, ranging from entertainment to disaster management and many more domains. However, in contrast to their powerful and diverse entrance into our lifestyle and society, they do not yet provide sufficient intrinsic fail-safe mechanisms to prevent accidents that may occur due to technical problems or unforeseen flight incidents such as turbulent winds, inexperienced pilots, and so on. Therefore, in the current study, we propose the use of an integrated intelligent motor controller, which is trained to recognize incidents directly from the on-board sensors (barometer, gyroscope, compass and accelerometer) and react in real-time, adjusting the drone's motors. The goal is to provide a small, intelligent, low-power, real-time, built-in controller for multirotor UAVs that will be able to understand a dangerous scenario right before it happens, start taking counter measures to keep the drone safe, and provide the pilot with a bigger reaction-time window. We propose the use of an artificial neural network, implemented in a lightweight embedded processing board, that is able to recognize and react in real-time to various turbulent situations. Experimental results suggest that our controller is able to respond properly and timely to wind changes (turbulence) allowing the drone to maintain its expected state and path.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2017.8203456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2017.8203456","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168766/8203442/08203456.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent embedded and real-time ANN-based motor control for multi-rotor unmanned aircraft systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203456/","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent embedded and real-time ANN-based motor control for multi-rotor unmanned aircraft systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17431092","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203456/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent embedded and real-time ANN-based motor control for multi-rotor unmanned aircraft systems","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"MS3B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074611S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168766","isNumber":"8203442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168766","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8203442","articleId":"8203456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8203472,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto G.

Despite the impressive level of maturity, its application on circuits other than pipelined processors still remains an open issue. Firstly, the error detection mechanism relies on special flip-flops (FFs), the Razor-FFs, whose use imposes heavy hold-time fixing and large circuit area/power overheads; secondly, the error correction is performed through instruction replay, a practice that is not available (or very expensive to implement) in generic circuits. This work introduces Early Bird Sampling (EBS), a Razor variant that applies to low-power sequential circuits. The EBS allows to (i) solve the problem of short-path races bypassing tedious holdtime fixing design stages, (ii) reduce design overhead exploiting a local logic-masking mechanism for error correction. As a key feature, EBS enables Data-Driven Voltage Over-Scaling (DD-VOS), an aggressive dynamic voltage scaling strategy particularly suited for ultra-low power error-resilient applications. Simulation runs on a representative set of circuits provide a fair comparison with a standard Razor strategy.

Today, however, both technology and computer architectures are facing challenges that make them incapable of delivering the growing computing performance requirement at pre-defined constraints. This forces the exploration of both novel architectures and technologies; not only to maintain the economic profit of technology scaling, but also to enable the computing architecture solutions for big-data and data-intensive applications. This paper discusses the emerging memristive device as a complement (or an alternative) to CMOS devices and shows how such devices enable novel computing paradigms that will solve the challenges of today's architectures for certain applications.

New transistor technologies, including FinFET technology, were developed to deal with this effect and enable the continuous scaling-down of technological nodes. Alongside the constant scale-down of integrated circuits technology, the increasing need to store more and more information has resulted in the fact that Static Random Access Memories (SRAMs) occupy great part of Systems-on-Chip (SoCs). The manufacturing process variation has introduced different types of defects that directly affect the SRAM's reliability. Thus, it remains unknown if fault models used to characterize faults in CMOS memory circuits are sufficiently accurate to represent the behavior of FinFET-based memories. In this context, a study of functional implications of manufacturing resistive defects in FinFET-based SRAMs is presented. In more detail, a fault model for FinFET-based SRAMs as well as a complete analysis of the static and dynamic fault behavior are presented. The proposed analysis has been performed by means of SPICE simulations, adopting a 20nm technology library. The faults were categorized in single and coupling, static and dynamic faults.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203483/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17431075","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing the behavior of FinFET SRAMs with resistive defects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing the behavior of FinFET SRAMs with resistive defects","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"WS13B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116783S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168766","isNumber":"8203442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168766","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8203442","articleId":"8203483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8203489,"authors":[{"name":"Mahesh Kumar Adimulam","affiliation":["EE Department, Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Mahesh Kumar","lastName":"Adimulam","id":"37545560400"},{"name":"Krishna Kumar Movva","affiliation":["EE Department, Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Krishna Kumar","lastName":"Movva","id":"37589747100"},{"name":"Amit Kapoor","affiliation":["EE Department, Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Kapoor","id":"37086272719"},{"name":"M.B Srinivas","affiliation":["EE Department, Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"M.B","lastName":"Srinivas","id":"37297438800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2879-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2881-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"}],"articleNumber":"8203489","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203489","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Resistors","Threshold voltage","Power demand","Voltage control","Transistors","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS digital integrated circuits","comparators (circuits)","integrated circuit design","logic gates","low-power electronics","MOSFET circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption","programmable bias inverter quantizer flash ADC","conventional comparator","BIQ flash ADC design","biopotential signal processing","digital inverter","cascode PMOS bias transistor","NMOS bias transistors","switching threshold values","reduced input gate load capacitance","control bits","CMOS process","size 90.0 nm","voltage 1.0 V","power 220.0 nW","power 18.5 mW","word length 5 bit","word length 6 bit","word length 7 bit","word length 8 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bias Inverter Quantizer (BIQ)","flash ADC","programmable resolution","calibration","process variation","low power consumption","lower area"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a low power, programmable bias inverter quantizer (BIQ) flash ADC for communication and biopotential signal processing applications is presented.

The voltage range of the bias transistors will control different switching threshold values of the inverter.

The theme covers 10 cultural tourism theme categories, including monuments tour, natural exploration, historical traces, industrial development, political development, edutainment, religious belief, arts and aesthetics, community tour, and food feast. The dimension contains 5 dimension features such as events, people, objects, places, and time. In order to help users quickly understand the spatial and temporal relevance of cultural tourism information, the theme categories are classified based on the event features and the relationship between the theme and dimension is constructed through the MDST data model. Then, the theme and dimension data are linked to the TGS to provide the customized tour information to users. By this way, the interest and depth of cultural resources can be increased and the cultural tourism value of Wu-Feng will be enhanced.","doi":"10.23919/PNC.2017.8203532","publicationTitle":"2017 Pacific Neighborhood Consortium Annual Conference and Joint Meetings (PNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Pacific Neighborhood Consortium Annual Conference and Joint Meetings (PNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168767/8203499/08203532.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/PNC.2017.8203532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-dimensional spatio-temporal data model \u2014 Application to tourism guidance system of cultural resources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-dimensional spatio-temporal data model \u2014 Application to tourism guidance system of cultural resources","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17431131","htmlLink":"/document/8203532/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-dimensional spatio-temporal data model \u2014 Application to tourism guidance system of cultural resources","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"18paper18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03778S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168767","isNumber":"8203499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168767","xplore-issue":"8203499","articleId":"8203532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Pacific Neighborhood Consortium (PNC)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8203554,"authors":[{"name":"Daiji Sakurai","affiliation":["School of Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences, Meiji University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Daiji","lastName":"Sakurai","id":"37086228177"},{"name":"Yoshikazu Fukuyama","affiliation":["School of Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences, Meiji University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshikazu","lastName":"Fukuyama","id":"37294621000"},{"name":"Adamo Santana","affiliation":["Institute of Technology, Federal University of Para, Para, Brazil"],"firstName":"Adamo","lastName":"Santana","id":"37970897000"},{"name":"Yu Kawamura","affiliation":["Tatsuya Iizaka and Tetsuro Matsui, Fuji Electric Co.

Since power system is one of the infrastructures of social community, not only fast computation, but also sustainable control (dependability) is strongly required for VRPC.

One of the solutions to this problem is pseudorehearsal, in which pseudopatterns are learned with training patterns. This method has shown superior performance for multilayer neural networks trained by the backpropagation algorithm. However, the backpropagation algorithm is biologically implausible because it requires passage of information backward from output neurons to input ones. On the other hand, Contrastive Hebbian Learning (CHL) is a learning method using Hebbian rule for synaptic weight changes. Since Hebbian learning can be performed locally between two neurons and doesn't need to take into account the overall input-output for the network, it is much more biologically plausible than the backpropagation algorithm. In this paper, we examine characteristics of multilayer neural networks trained by CHL with pseudorehearsal when information is applied sequentially, and how catastrophic forgetting can be reduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203567/","accessionNumber":"17431053","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203567/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"11-12 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reduction of catastrophic forgetting in multilayer neural networks trained by contrastive Hebbian Learning with pseudorehearsal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of catastrophic forgetting in multilayer neural networks trained by contrastive Hebbian Learning with pseudorehearsal","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"IWCIA2017p91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074659S","chronDate":"11-12 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168765","isNumber":"8203544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168765","xplore-issue":"8203544","articleId":"8203567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8203576,"authors":[{"name":"Sufeng Niu","affiliation":["Clemson University, SC, USA","Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sufeng","lastName":"Niu","id":"37086269683"},{"name":"A.M Koushik","affiliation":["The Univerisity of Alabama, AL, USA","Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"A.M","lastName":"Koushik","id":"37086104417"},{"name":"Rui Ma","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Koon Hoo Teo","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Koon Hoo","lastName":"Teo","id":"37085351395"},{"name":"Shintaro Shinjo","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Shintaro","lastName":"Shinjo","id":"37298358300"},{"name":"Yuji Komatsuzaki","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Komatsuzaki","id":"37085502761"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0469-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0468-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0470-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8203576","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastically approximated multiobjective optimization of dual input digital Doherty Power Amplifier","abstract":"In this work, we propose a novel adaptive control on digital Doherty Power Amplifier (DPA) for efficiency and gain enhancement.

The optimal performance is defined as good linearity, Power Added Efficiency (PAE) and gain. We mainly investigate the efficiency and gain improvements since the linearity can be separately addressed by traditional DPD techniques. Even though we found that the cost function of optimization exists in several local optimums, they are very close, and thereby local minimum is not of great concern in this optimization. In addition, we approximate the DPA circuit model for the fast verification using regression model.

The details on common tools and authorship attribution techniques published in the recent past would be of importance to the concerned researchers as an aid towards text data mining and future growth in the study of authorship attribution.","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168799/8203590/08203599.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent approaches on authorship attribution techniques \u2014 An overview","doi":"10.1109/ICECA.2017.8203599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA.2017.8203599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Recent approaches on authorship attribution techniques \u2014 An overview","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17433099","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203599/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent approaches on authorship attribution techniques \u2014 An overview","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090615S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8203590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8203590","articleId":"8203599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203606,"authors":[{"name":"Harikumar Rajaguru","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Bannari Amman Institute of Technology, Sathyamangalam, India"],"firstName":"Harikumar","lastName":"Rajaguru","id":"37085665142"},{"name":"Sunil Kumar Prabhakar","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Bannari Amman Institute of Technology, Sathyamangalam, India"],"firstName":"Sunil Kumar","lastName":"Prabhakar","id":"37085668783"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5686-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5685-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5687-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8203606","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203606","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Epilepsy","Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","electroencephalography","genetic algorithms","medical disorders","medical signal detection","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EEG recordings","dependence maximization","elite genetic algorithm","average time delay","epilepsy classification","global neurological disorders","cerebral cortex","brain","continuous seizures","spontaneous seizures","recurrent seizures","neurological disorder","multilabel dimensionality reduction","time 2.44 s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EEG","epilepsy","Dependence Maximization","GA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECA.2017.8203606","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168799/8203590/08203606.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","startPage":"594","endPage":"597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA.2017.8203606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Epilepsy classification through multi-label dimensionality reduction through dependence maximization and elite genetic algorithm","abstract":"One of the global neurological disorders affecting the cerebral cortex of the brain is epilepsy. It is considered as a persistent neurological disorder that exists since a long period of time. Characterized by continuous, spontaneous and recurrent seizures, they cause a great harm to the patient. The activities of the neurons can be easily recorded by Electroencephalogram (EEG). A mandatory requirement for the automated detection of epilepsy using EEG holds a high impact in the diagnosis and analysis of the disorder. Since the EEG recordings occur for a long period of time, processing it is difficult and so the dimensions of it are reduced with the help of Multi-label dimensionality reduction through dependence maximization. The dimensionally reduced values are then classified with the help of Elite Genetic Algorithm (GA). The results show that an average accuracy of about 89.68%, an average time delay of about 2.44 seconds along with an average performance index of 71.76% is obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203606/","accessionNumber":"17433109","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8203606/","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Epilepsy classification through multi-label dimensionality reduction through dependence maximization and elite genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Epilepsy classification through multi-label dimensionality reduction through dependence maximization and elite genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082079S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8203590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8203590","articleId":"8203606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203641,"authors":[{"name":"Manisha B.

A dataset is considered to be imbalanced if one of the classes (further called a minority class or positive class) contains much smaller number of instances than the remaining classes (majority classes or negative class). We describe a new approach to balance data with improved classification. Resampling approaches is a group of popular and flexible techniques to deal with class imbalance, which attempt to resample the original dataset, by oversampling the minority class and/or under sampling the majority class the imbalanced learning problem, there are various methods that solve the imbalanced data at data level and algorithm level. The purpose of this paper is to present a more detailed analysis of density based cluster oversampling and under sampling techniques in terms of density based clustering. The concept of density based cluster sampling called DBCS is to use DBSCAN algorithm for discover clutters and apply oversampling and resampling in minority and majority class respectively. The experimental results of the hybrid DBCS algorithm are compared with an original datasets and other sampling techniques.

Unlike the earlier method of single objective function optimization based controller design which gives the single best controller, the present method generates multiple sets of controller parameters. The present method is shown to exhibit better closed loop performance than the existing methods for the cascade controller. This proposed method is also a single step tuning procedure in that the controller parameters in both loops are simultaneously calculated. Application of the MOO concept has also shown how the chosen objective functions are related to each other. This apriori knowledge of the interdependence of objective functions is important in the design of controllers since it constrains the best performance achievable. This also helps in anticipating the tradeoffs in the objective function behavior.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203675/","accessionNumber":"17433132","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8203675/","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient method to design a series cascade controller using multi-objective optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient method to design a series cascade controller using multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050597S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8203590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8203590","articleId":"8203675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203693,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This paper deals with the former one (i.e. channel bandwidth); the real time images from any source occupy large amount space in any storage device. Hence it consumes maximum bandwidth for transmitting it, there are so many methods to reduce the image size and hence the bandwidth of the signal. This paper deals with wavelet based compression methods. Discrete Wavelet Transform is powerful tool for analyzing the signals, with the help of a thresholding function it'll be more useful in compression; this method is considered as an existing method. This method has some disadvantages like selectivity and shift invariance, so a much better method is proposed. In the proposed method complex wavelets were introduced with custom thresholding for reducing the size of images with less mean square error (MSE) and peak-signal to noise ratio (PSNR).","doi":"10.1109/ICECA.2017.8203693","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168799/8203590/08203693.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA.2017.8203693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image compression using complex wavelet transform (CWT) with custom thresholding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203693/","displayDocTitle":"Image compression using complex wavelet transform (CWT) with custom thresholding","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17501660","htmlLink":"/document/8203693/","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression using complex wavelet transform (CWT) with custom thresholding","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039349S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8203590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8203590","articleId":"8203693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203696,"authors":[{"name":"Lidiya Lilly Thampi","affiliation":["IT Department, Cochin university of science & Technology, Cochin, India"],"firstName":"Lidiya Lilly","lastName":"Thampi","id":"37073103600"},{"name":"Varghese Paul","affiliation":["IT Department, Cochin university of science & Technology, Cochin, India"],"firstName":"Varghese","lastName":"Paul","id":"37650519200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5686-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5685-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5687-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8203696","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"abstract":"Medical Imaging is an important keystone of modem healthcare and will continue to play a role of ever increasing importance at all levels of the healthcare system due to advances in imaging technology (US, CT, MR and Molecular Imaging). Due to this big data of medical images, compression is required to achieve efficient transmission and storage. The proposed procedure is applied to diverse ultrasound cancerous images (endometrial cancer). Hence diagnosis of this type of uterus cancer in the premier stage is crucial, certain segmentation algorithms are applied and these will separate the infected region from the background which will be easy for the medical practitioners to decide the cancer and steer medication. The ultrasound image which is developed from an organ is preprocessed and the filtered image is given to level set segmentation and finally the contextual part of the image is encoded using wavelet decomposition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168799/8203590/08203696.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","doi":"10.1109/ICECA.2017.8203696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA.2017.8203696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of compression after the detection of endometrial carcinoma imaging: Future scopes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Cancer","Image segmentation","Medical diagnostic imaging","Ultrasonic imaging","Level set"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","biomedical ultrasonics","cancer","gynaecology","health care","image coding","image segmentation","medical image processing","tumours","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtered image","level set segmentation","endometrial carcinoma imaging","Medical Imaging","healthcare system","Molecular Imaging","medical images","endometrial cancer","uterus cancer","medical practitioners","ultrasound cancerous images","image encoding","wavelet decomposition","image compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["endometrial cancer segmentation","lossless compression","speckle noise","ultrasound image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Application of compression after the detection of endometrial carcinoma imaging: Future scopes","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8203696/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17433079","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of compression after the detection of endometrial carcinoma imaging: Future scopes","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062653S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8203590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8203590","articleId":"8203696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203700,"authors":[{"name":"B.

When sudden rumbling of sound associated with a bolt of lightning flashed across the sky, then thunderstorm is said to be occurring. Lightning is associated with every thunderstorm, which kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes. Heavy rain from thunderstorm causes extensive loss of property and leads to flooding. Accurate prediction of thunderstorm is a difficult task in weather forecasting due to its temporal extension and spatial either physically or dynamically. Different technological and scientific researchers are carried on forecasting of thunderstorm and lightning in advance to reduce damages. In this regard, there are many different methodologies have been proposed such as statistical, machine learning, numerical weather prediction, weather research forecasting, image processing etc. This paper focuses on the survey of several research papers on the thunderstorm and lightning using soft computing and data mining techniques such as neural network, rough set, support vector machine, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, k-means clustering, k-nearest neighbor etc. This paper has been also enclosed the suggestions on the future research direction.","doi":"10.1109/ICECA.2017.8203729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA.2017.8203729","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168799/8203590/08203729.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft computing and data mining techniques for thunderstorms and lightning prediction: A survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Soft computing and data mining techniques for thunderstorms and lightning prediction: A survey","isConference":true,"volume":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203729/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17433108","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203729/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft computing and data mining techniques for thunderstorms and lightning prediction: A survey","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067173S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8203590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8203590","articleId":"8203729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203756,"authors":[{"name":"Yeseong Kim","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Yeseong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085640764"},{"name":"Mohsen Imani","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Imani","id":"37074212000"},{"name":"Tajana Rosing","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Tajana","lastName":"Rosing","id":"37295875800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203756","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":785},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203756","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Computational modeling","Object recognition","Image recognition","Nonvolatile memory","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","feature extraction","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate in-memory processing","machine learning","recognition procedures","data movement","memory accesses","object recognition tasks","image feature extraction","state-of-the-art image recognition approaches","approximate computing","NVM","computation overhead","practical image recognition tasks","vehicle recognition","computation approximation","energy efficiency","hardware accelerator design","visual object recognition accelerator","ORCHARD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaboost","object recognition","processing in-memory","non-volatile memory"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, machine learning for visual object recognition has been applied to various domains, e.g., autonomous vehicle, heath diagnose, and home automation.

In this paper, we propose a novel hardware accelerator design, called ORCHARD, which processes the object recognition tasks inside memory. The proposed design accelerates both the image feature extraction and boosting-based learning algorithm, which are key subtasks of the state-of-the-art image recognition approaches. We optimize the recognition procedures by leveraging approximate computing and emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technology. The NVM-based in-memory processing allows the proposed design to mitigate the CMOS-based computation overhead, highly improving the system efficiency. In our evaluation conducted on circuit- and device-level simulations, we show that ORCHARD successfully performs practical image recognition tasks, including text, face, pedestrian, and vehicle recognition with 0.3% of accuracy loss made by computation approximation. In addition, our design significantly improves the performance and energy efficiency by up to 376x and 1896x, respectively, compared to the existing processor-based implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203756","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203756.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ORCHARD: Visual object recognition accelerator based on approximate in-memory processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ORCHARD: Visual object recognition accelerator based on approximate in-memory processing","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430523","htmlLink":"/document/8203756/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ORCHARD: Visual object recognition accelerator based on approximate in-memory processing","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058489S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203757,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed El Massad","affiliation":["New York University, Brooklyn, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed El","lastName":"Massad","id":"37085859108"},{"name":"Siddharth Garg","affiliation":["New York University, Brooklyn, USA"],"firstName":"Siddharth","lastName":"Garg","id":"37289176300"},{"name":"Mahesh Tripunitara","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahesh","lastName":"Tripunitara","id":"37424551500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203757","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":692},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Integrated circuits","Sequential circuits","Reverse engineering","Standards","Benchmark testing","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational circuits","copy protection","logic design","reverse engineering","sequential circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit camouflaging","SAT solver","SAT attack","camouflaged combinational circuits","camouflaged sequential circuits","scan chain access","reverse engineering attacks","camouflaged gates","camouflaged IC","bounded model checker","VIPER processor"]}],"abstract":"Integrated circuit (IC) camouflaging is a promising technique to protect the design of a chip from reverse engineering. However, recent work has shown that even camouflaged ICs can be reverse engineered from the observed input/output behaviour of a chip using SAT solvers. However, these so-called SAT attacks have so far targeted only camouflaged combinational circuits. For camouflaged sequential circuits, the SAT attack requires that the internal state of the circuit is controllable and observable via the scan chain. It has been implicitly assumed that restricting scan chain access increases the security of camouflaged ICs from reverse engineering attacks. In this paper, we develop a new attack methodology to decamouflage sequential circuits without scan access. Our attack uses a model checker (a more powerful reasoning tool than a SAT solver) to find a discriminating set of input sequences, i.e., one that is sufficient to determine the functionality of camouflaged gates. We propose several refinements, including the use of a bounded model checker, and sufficient conditions for determining when a set of input sequences is discriminating to improve the run-time and scalabilty of our attack. Our attack is able to decamouflage a large sequential benchmark circuit that implements a subset of the VIPER processor.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203757","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203757.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse engineering camouflaged sequential circuits without scan access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Reverse engineering camouflaged sequential circuits without scan access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203757/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430551","htmlLink":"/document/8203757/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverse engineering camouflaged sequential circuits without scan access","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120761S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203758,"authors":[{"name":"Satwik Patnaik","affiliation":["Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, New York, USA"],"firstName":"Satwik","lastName":"Patnaik","id":"37086271094"},{"name":"Mohammed Ashraf","affiliation":["New York University - Abu Dhabi Campus, Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, AE"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Ashraf","id":"37086261873"},{"name":"Johann Knechtel","affiliation":["New York University Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Johann","lastName":"Knechtel","id":"38233986500"},{"name":"Ozgur Sinanoglu","affiliation":["New York University Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Sinanoglu","id":"37273781800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203758","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203758","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Layout","Wires","Art","Resilience","Scanning electron microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial property","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip design intellectual property","reverse engineers","split manufacturing","FEOL fab","customized manufacturing process","LC scheme","generic-full-chip LC","DRC-clean layout level","BEOL","SAT attacks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203758","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203758.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obfuscating the interconnects: Low-cost and resilient full-chip layout camouflaging","abstract":"Layout camouflaging (LC) is a promising technique to protect chip design intellectual property (IP) from reverse engineers. Most prior art, however, cannot leverage the full potential of LC due to excessive overheads and/or their limited scope on an FEOL-centric and accordingly customized manufacturing process. If at all, most existing techniques can be reasonably applied only to selected parts of a chip - we argue that such \u201csmall-scale or custom camouflaging\u201d will eventually be circumvented, irrespective of the underlying technique. In this work, we propose a novel LC scheme which is low-cost and generic - full-chip LC can finally be realized without any reservation. Our scheme is based on obfuscating the interconnects (BEOL); it can be readily applied to any design without modifications in the device layer (FEOL). Applied with split manufacturing in conjunction, our approach is the first in the literature to cope with both the FEOL fab and the end-user being untrustworthy. We implement and evaluate our primitives at the (DRC-clean) layout level; our scheme incurs significantly lower cost than most of the previous works. When comparing fully camouflaged to original layouts (i.e., for 100% LC), we observe on average power, performance, and area overheads of 12%, 30%, and 48%, respectively. Here we also show empirically that most existing LC techniques (as well as ours) can only provide proper resilience against powerful SAT attacks once at least 50% of the layout is camouflaged - only large-scale LC is practically secure. As indicated, our approach can deliver even 100% LC at acceptable cost. Finally, we also make our flow publicly available, enabling the community to protect their sensitive designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203758/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17430593","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203758/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Obfuscating the interconnects: Low-cost and resilient full-chip layout camouflaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obfuscating the interconnects: Low-cost and resilient full-chip layout camouflaging","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10346S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8203759,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Zhou","affiliation":["Northwestern University"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086304606"},{"name":"Ruifeng Jiang","affiliation":["Northwestern University"],"firstName":"Ruifeng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086296098"},{"name":"Shuyu Kong","affiliation":["Northwestern University"],"firstName":"Shuyu","lastName":"Kong","id":"37086296302"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203759","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":607},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Electronics packaging","Logic gates","Error analysis","Engines","Combinational circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic logic encryption","hardware security","circuit obfuscation technique","CycSAT algorithms","SAT-based techniques","feedback cycles"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203759","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203759.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203759","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CycSAT: SAT-based attack on cyclic logic encryptions","abstract":"Cyclic logic encryption is a newly proposed circuit obfuscation technique in hardware security.

The security of DNN itself is therefore of great concern. In this paper, we investigate the impact of fault injection attacks on DNN, wherein attackers try to misclassify a specified input pattern into an adversarial class by modifying the parameters used in DNN via fault injection. We propose two kinds of fault injection attacks to achieve this objective. Without considering stealthiness of the attack, single bias attack (SBA) only requires to modify one parameter in DNN for misclassification, based on the observation that the outputs of DNN may linearly depend on some parameters. Gradient descent attack (GDA) takes stealthiness into consideration. By controlling the amount of modification to DNN parameters, GDA is able to minimize the fault injection impact on input patterns other than the specified one. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attacks.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203770.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault injection attack on deep neural network","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fault injection attack on deep neural network","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430496","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203770/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault injection attack on deep neural network","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"02B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064092S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8203772,"authors":[{"name":"Armaiti Ardeshiricham","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Armaiti","lastName":"Ardeshiricham","id":"37086004241"},{"name":"Wei Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37399456600"},{"name":"Ryan Kastner","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Kastner","id":"37266396600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203772","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Hardware","Registers","Tools","Cryptography","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","formal verification","statistical analysis","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["completion time","hardware designs","confidential information","timing-based side channel leakage","breach data privacy","conventional hardware verification tools","hardware design process","formal security evaluations","Clepsydra","timing flows","generic logical flows","distinct channels","timing leakage","constant execution time","hardware units","modeling timing","side channel security attacks"]}],"abstract":"Emergence of side channel security attacks has challenged the classic assumptions regarding what data is publicly available. As demonstrated repeatedly, statistical analysis of information collected by measuring completion time of hardware designs can reveal confidential information. Even though timing-based side channel leakage can be easily exploited to breach data privacy, conventional hardware verification tools are not yet suited to assess these vulnerabilities. To acquaint the hardware design process with formal security evaluations, we introduce a model for tracking timing-based information flows through HDL codes. Based on this model, we have developed Clepsydra, a tool for automatically generating circuitry for tracking timing flows and generic logical flows within hardware designs in two distinct channels. The circuit generated by Clepsydra can be analyzed by EDA tools to detect timing leakage or formally prove constant execution time. We present proofs regarding soundness and precision of the proposed model along with results of employing Clepsydra to verify security properties on a variety of hardware units including crypto cores, bus architectures, caches and arithmetic modules.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203772","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203772.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","startPage":"147","endPage":"154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clepsydra: Modeling timing flows in hardware designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clepsydra: Modeling timing flows in hardware designs","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203772/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430615","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203772/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clepsydra: Modeling timing flows in hardware designs","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"02B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108451S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203773,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik V.

The key ideas behind DAGSENS are, (1) to represent the entire sequence of computations from DAE parameters to the objective function (whose sensitivity is needed) as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) called the \u201csensitivity DAG\u201d, and (2) to compute the required sensitivites efficiently by using dynamic programming techniques to traverse the DAG. DAGSENS is simple, elegant, and easy-to-understand compared to previous approaches; for example, in DAGSENS, one can switch between direct and adjoint sensitivities simply by reversing the direction of DAG traversal. Also, DAGSENS is more powerful than previous approaches because it works for a more general class of objective functions, including those based on \u201cevents\u201d that occur during a transient simulation (e.g., a node voltage crossing a threshold, a phase-locked loop (PLL) achieving lock, a circuit signal reaching its maximum/minimum value, etc.). In this paper, we demonstrate DAGSENS on several electronic and biological applications, including high-speed communication, statistical cell library characterization, and gene expression.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203773","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203773.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203773","startPage":"155","endPage":"162","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"DAGSENS: Directed acyclic graph based direct and adjoint transient sensitivity analysis for event-driven objective functions","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203773/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17418939","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DAGSENS: Directed acyclic graph based direct and adjoint transient sensitivity analysis for event-driven objective functions","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101078S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8203775,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyi Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Internet Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086045762"},{"name":"Yan Yan","affiliation":["Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Internet Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086267027"},{"name":"Jian He","affiliation":["Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Internet Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"He","id":"37086045691"},{"name":"Sheldon X.-D.

In this paper, we propose a new analyses method for the EM hydrostatic stress evolution for multi-branch interconnect trees, which is the foundation of the EM reliability assessment for large scale on-chip interconnect networks, such as power grid networks. The proposed method, which is based on eigenfunctions technique, could efficiently calculate the hydrostatic stress evolution for multi-branch interconnect trees stressed with different current densities and non-uniformly distributed thermal effects. The new method can also accommodate the pre-existing residual stresses coming from thermal or other stress sources. The proposed method solves the partial differential equations of EM stress more efficiently since it does not require any discretization either spatially or temporally, which is in contrast to numerical methods such as finite difference method and finite element method. The accuracy of the proposed transient analysis approach is validated against the analytical solution and commercial tools. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated and compared to finite difference method. The proposed method is 10X~100X times faster than finite difference method and scales better for larger interconnect trees.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on

We hypothesize that existing hardware construction languages (HCLs) and novel hardware compiler frameworks (HCFs) can put hardware development on a similar evolutionary path by enabling new hardware libraries to be independent of underlying process technologies including FPGA mappings. We support this claim by (1) evaluating the degree with which Chisel, an existing HCL, can support powerfully parameterized libraries, and (2) introducing the concept and implementation of an HCF that uses an open-source hardware intermediate representation, FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation for RTL), to transform target-independent RTL into technology-specific RTL. Finally, we evaluate many hardware compiler transformations, including simplifying transformations, analyses, optimizations, instrumentations, and specializations, which demonstrate the power of a combined HCL and HCF approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203780","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203780.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reusability is FIRRTL ground: Hardware construction languages, compiler frameworks, and transformations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reusability is FIRRTL ground: Hardware construction languages, compiler frameworks, and transformations","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430568","htmlLink":"/document/8203780/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reusability is FIRRTL ground: Hardware construction languages, compiler frameworks, and transformations","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03C2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11161S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203782,"authors":[{"name":"Rotem Ben Hur","affiliation":["Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Rotem","lastName":"Ben Hur","id":"37085851471"},{"name":"Nimrod Wald","affiliation":["Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Nimrod","lastName":"Wald","id":"37085451253"},{"name":"Nishil Talati","affiliation":["Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Nishil","lastName":"Talati","id":"37085380525"},{"name":"Shahar Kvatinsky","affiliation":["Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Shahar","lastName":"Kvatinsky","id":"37601405900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203782","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":996},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203782","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Memristors","Logic functions","Arrays","Optimization","Tools","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic gates","memristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory-CPU bottleneck","in-memory Mapping","logic execution","arbitrary logic function","memristive memory","memristor-aided logic NOR gates","in-memory logic operations","atomic memristor-aided logic NOR operations","standard synthesis tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristor","memristive systems","logic design","MAGIC","mMPU","von Neumann architecture","logic synthesis"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach for designing and implementing in-memory logic operations. The uniqueness of this work is the development of SIMPLE, a framework that optimizes the execution of an arbitrary logic function, while considering all the constraints involved in performing it within a memristive memory. SIMPLE automatically generates a defined sequence of atomic memristor-aided logic NOR operations, whose implementation can be facilitated efficiently within the memory. Motivated to overcome the memory-CPU bottleneck, this approach designs an optimal solution in terms of performance by exploiting the parallelism of the memristor-aided logic NOR gates. SIMPLE achieves performance speedups of 1.94x compared to a previous work and 1.48x compared to a na\u00efve optimization based on standard synthesis tools.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203782","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203782.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple magic: Synthesis and in-memory Mapping of logic execution for memristor-aided logic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Simple magic: Synthesis and in-memory Mapping of logic execution for memristor-aided logic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430574","htmlLink":"/document/8203782/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple magic: Synthesis and in-memory Mapping of logic execution for memristor-aided logic","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"04A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059728S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8203785,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Chang","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA","BDBC, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085833533"},{"name":"Zhaohao Wang","affiliation":["BDBC, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085376060"},{"name":"Alvin Oliver Glova","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alvin Oliver","lastName":"Glova","id":"37086298735"},{"name":"Jishen Zhao","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jishen","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085443152"},{"name":"Youguang Zhang","affiliation":["BDBC, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086214193"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37085866983"},{"name":"Weisheng Zhao","affiliation":["BDBC, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38088111700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203785","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Random access memory","Switches","Computer architecture","Magnetization","Torque","Magnetic switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","magnetic storage","magnetic tunnelling","MRAM devices","random-access storage","spin-orbit interactions","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CP MRAM","CP STT-MRAM","spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory","zero leakage power consumption","nonvolatile magnetoresistive random access memory","spin-orbit torque MRAM","spin-transfer torque MRAM","lower energy dissipation","SOT-MRAM technology","memory cells","unidirectional write scheme","storage density","volatile memories","PreSET-based cross-point MRAM","PRESCOTT","preset-based cross-point architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MRAM","Spin Orbit Torque","Memory Cell","Cross-Point"]}],"abstract":"Due to nearly zero leakage power consumption, non-volatile magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) is becoming one of the promising candidates for replacing conventional volatile memories (e.g. SRAM and DRAM). In particular, emerging spin-orbit torque (SOT) MRAM is considered to outperform spin-transfer torque (STT) MRAM due to its fast switching, separate read/write paths, and lower energy dissipation. However, the SOT-MRAM technology is still in its infancy; one key design challenge is that the control of SOT-MRAM, which involves three terminals, is more complicated compared with STT-MRAM. In this paper, we propose a novel MRAM write scheme called PRESCOTT\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n, where the \u201c1\u201d and \u201c0\u201d data values can be written into memory cells through the SOT and STT, respectively. As a result, the write current is unidirectional rather than bi-directional, which addresses the control complexity. Using this unidirectional write scheme, we design a PreSET-based cross-point (CP) MRAM to improve programing speed, write energy dissipation and storage density compared to conventional MRAM. Circuit simulation results demonstrate that our PreSET-based CP MRAM can achieve around 67.14% average write energy reduction and 50.86% improvement in programming speed, compared with CP STT-MRAM.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203785","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203785.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PRESCOTT: Preset-based cross-point architecture for spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"PRESCOTT: Preset-based cross-point architecture for spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203785/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430538","htmlLink":"/document/8203785/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PRESCOTT: Preset-based cross-point architecture for spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"04A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100726S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203786,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Khavari Tavana","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad Khavari","lastName":"Tavana","id":"38236939500"},{"name":"David Kaeli","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Kaeli","id":"37271686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203786","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203786","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","phase change memories","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PCM density","rapid technology scaling","single chip","core integration","large memory system","scalable main memory system","current DRAM","scalability issues","sub-micron scales","Phase Change Memory","programming cells","inter-cell space","cell programming","cost-effective solutions","memory system metrics","vulnerable data patterns","vulnerable cells","energy consumption","cost-effective write disturbance mitigation techniques","data encoding","performance overhead"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["write disturbance","phase change memory","energy","endurance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203786","endPage":"260","startPage":"253","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203786.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-effective write disturbance mitigation techniques for advancing PCM density","abstract":"Rapid technology scaling has enabled the integration of many cores into a single chip. Given this level of core integration, the requirements for a large and scalable main memory system will only grow. Current DRAM-based main memory systems face power and scalability issues when working at sub-micron scales. Phase Change Memory (PCM) has been proposed as one of the most promising technology candidates to replace or complement DRAM. However, scaling down cell sizes introduces significant thermal-based write disturbance challenges in PCM. Due to the heat generated for programming cells, neighboring cells may be disturbed, experiencing changes in their values. A naive solution is to increase inter-cell space, attempting to isolate cell programming and eliminating write disturbance, but this approach significantly reduces PCM density. In this paper, we propose two cost-effective solutions to reduce the probability of write disturbance. Our solutions come with few side-effects on other memory system metrics. The first technique is based on data encoding, and tries to reduce the number of vulnerable data patterns when writing data to main memory. The second technique detects vulnerable cells, and overwrites them if their occurrence is below a set threshold. The proposed techniques are general and can avoid much of the performance overhead introduced by write disturbance. Our proposed solutions can reduce the average number of writes by 49% over traditional schemes, while incurring minimal impact on PCM lifetime and energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203786/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203786/","accessionNumber":"17430562","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cost-effective write disturbance mitigation techniques for advancing PCM density","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-effective write disturbance mitigation techniques for advancing PCM density","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"04B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053904S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8203787,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Wen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Wen","id":"37086335547"},{"name":"Lei Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085751437"},{"name":"Youtao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh"],"firstName":"Youtao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38183309800"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085482592"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203787","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":604},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Resistance","Random access memory","Correlation","Nonvolatile memory","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","DRAM chips","memory architecture","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic energy waste","low resistant state","ReRAM RESET operations","LRS cells","in-memory processing capability","ReRAM crossbar","low overhead runtime profiler","RESET latency reduction","data compression","row address dependent data layout","crossbar resistive memory","in-memory data patterns","nonvolatile memory technology","operation reliability","ReRAM arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resistive Memory","Data Pattern","Crossbar Array"]}],"abstract":"Resistive Memory (ReRAM) has emerged as a promising non-volatile memory technology that may replace a significant portion of DRAM in future computer systems. ReRAM has many advantages such as high density, low standby power and good scalability. ReRAM, when adopting crossbar architecture, has the smallest 4F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n planar cell size, which is ideal for constructing dense memory with large capacity. However, crossbar cell structure suffers from large sneak leakage and IR drop on long wires. To ensure operation reliability, ReRAM writes, in particular, RESET operations, conservatively use the worst-case access latency of all cells in ReRAM arrays, which leads to significant performance degradation and dynamic energy waste. In this paper, we study the correlation between the RESET latency and the number of cells in low resistant state (LRS) along bitlines, and propose to dynamically speed up ReRAM RESET operations for the rows that have small numbers of LRS cells. We leverage the intrinsic in-memory processing capability of ReRAM crossbar and propose a low overhead runtime profiler that effectively tracks the data patterns in different bitlines. To achieve further RESET latency reduction, we employ data compression and row address dependent data layout to reduce LRS cells on bitlines. The experimental results show that, on average, our design improves system performance by 20.5% and 14.2%, and reduces memory dynamic energy by 15.7% and 7.6%, compared to the baseline and the state-of-the-art crossbar design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speeding up crossbar resistive memory by exploiting in-memory data patterns","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203787","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203787.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Speeding up crossbar resistive memory by exploiting in-memory data patterns","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203787/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430627","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speeding up crossbar resistive memory by exploiting in-memory data patterns","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"04B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073408S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203788,"authors":[{"name":"Hengyu Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hengyu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086284088"},{"name":"Linuo Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Linuo","lastName":"Xue","id":"37086036710"},{"name":"Ping Chi","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Chi","id":"37085644066"},{"name":"Jishen Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jishen","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085443152"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203788","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":521},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203788","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change random access memory","Memory management","Image storage","Energy consumption","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","energy consumption","image processing","MRAM devices","phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel cell STT-MRAM main memory","consumer devices","image processing applications","high energy consumption","approximate image data storage","multilevel cell spin-transfer torque MRAM","unique design opportunities","image memory","memory cell","soft bit","hard bit","approximate image processing scheme","system energy efficiency","approximate image storage mechanism","MLC STT-MRAM main memory","precise/approximate memory access modes","image processing functionalities","memory access energy consumption","MLC phase-change-memory","image data approximation","memory mode controller","image quality requirement","asymmetric write current","word length 2.0 bit"]}],"abstract":"Images consume significant storage and space in both consumer devices and in the cloud.

The relentless pursuit of high-performance SSDs renders FTLs increasingly complex and intricate. Therefore, testing and validating FTLs are crucial and challenging tasks. Directly testing and validating FTLs on SSD hardware are common practices though, they are time-consuming and cumbersome because 1) the testing speed is limited by the hardware speed of SSDs and 2) just reproducing bugs can be challenging, let alone locating and root causing the bugs. This work presents virtual stress testing (VST), a simulation framework to enable executing SSD FTLs on PCs or servers against virtual SRAM, DRAM, and flash emulated by host-side main memory. FTL function calls, such as moving data from flash to DRAM, are served by the VST framework. Therefore, VST can test FTLs without SSD hardware requirements nor SSD speed limitations, and root causing bugs becomes manageable tasks. We apply VST to representative SSD design, OpenSSD, which is actively utilized and maintained by SSD and FTL communities.

Before the testing (inference) phases in practical use, sophisticated training (learning) phases are required, calling for efficient training methods with higher accuracy and shorter converging time. Many existing studies focus on the training optimization on high-performance servers or computing clusters, e.g. GPU clusters. However, training neural networks on resource-constrained devices, e.g. mobile platforms, is an important research topic barely touched. In this paper, we implement AdaLearner-an adaptive distributed mobile learning system for neural networks that trains a single network with heterogenous mobile resources under the same local network in parallel. To exploit the potential of our system, we adapt neural networks training phase to mobile device-wise resources and fiercely decrease the transmission overhead for better system scalability. On three representative neural network structures trained from two image classification datasets, AdaLearner boosts the training phase significantly. For example, on LeNet, 1.75-3.37\u00d7 speedup is achieved when increasing the worker nodes from 2 to 8, thanks to the achieved high execution parallelism and excellent scalability.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203791","startPage":"291","endPage":"296","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203791.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AdaLearner: An adaptive distributed mobile learning system for neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203791/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"AdaLearner: An adaptive distributed mobile learning system for neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203791/","accessionNumber":"17430543","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AdaLearner: An adaptive distributed mobile learning system for neural networks","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"04C2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067671S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8203798,"authors":[{"name":"Gai Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY"],"firstName":"Gai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085584203"},{"name":"Zhiru Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY"],"firstName":"Zhiru","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38552737500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203798","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":426},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203798","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Measurement","Error analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Optimization","Table lookup","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","logic design","optimisation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user-specified error constraints","statistically certified approximate logic synthesis","logic functions","error behavior","approximate circuits","error rate","approximate designs"]}],"abstract":"Approximate logic synthesis generates inexact implementations of logic functions in exchange for better design qualities such as area, timing and power consumption.

During the synthesis process, our framework continuously monitors the quality of the generated designs using statistical testing, leading to approximate designs that adhere to user-specified error constraints with a high confidence level.

exact delay synthesis","abstract":"Given (i) a Boolean function, (ii) a set of arrival times at the inputs, and (iii) a gate library with associated delay values, the exact delay synthesis problem asks for a circuit implementation which minimizes the arrival time at the output(s). The exact delay synthesis problem, with given input arrival times, relates to computing the communication complexity of a Boolean function, which is an intractable problem. Input arrival times are variable and can take any value, thereby making the exact delay synthesis search space infinite. This paper presents theory and algorithms for exact delay synthesis. We introduce the theory of equioptimizable arrival times, which allows us to partition all arrival time patterns into a finite set of equivalence classes. Thanks to this new theory, we create for the first time exact delay circuit databases covering all Boolean functions up to 5 variables and all possible arrival time patterns. We describe further arrival time compression techniques which enable the creation of larger databases. We propose an enhanced delay synthesis flow capable of dealing with large circuits, combining exact delay logic rewriting and Boolean optimization techniques, attaining unprecedented results. We improve 9/10 of the best known results in the EPFL arithmetic delay synthesis competition, outperforming previous best results up to 3x. Embedded in a commercial EDA flow for ASICs, our exact delay synthesis techniques reduce the total negative slack by 12.17%, after physical implementation, at negligible area and runtime costs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203799/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203799/","accessionNumber":"17430502","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Enabling exact delay synthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling exact delay synthesis","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"05B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203807,"authors":[{"name":"Milan \u010ce\u0161ka","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"\u010ce\u0161ka","id":"37085936469"},{"name":"Ji\u0159\u00ed Matya\u0161","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ji\u0159\u00ed","lastName":"Matya\u0161","id":"37085789177"},{"name":"Vojtech Mrazek","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Vojtech","lastName":"Mrazek","id":"37085347230"},{"name":"Lukas Sekanina","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Sekanina","id":"37272319600"},{"name":"Zdenek Vasicek","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Vasicek","id":"37391766000"},{"name":"Tomas Vojnar","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Vojnar","id":"38667890300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203807","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Measurement","Tools","Scalability","Approximation error","Search problems","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","approximation theory","circuit optimisation","digital arithmetic","function approximation","multiplying circuits","Pareto optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation error","circuit optimisation algorithm","search strategy","complex arithmetic circuits","approximate equivalence checking","verifiable approximate circuits","Pareto set","approximate complex arithmetic circuits","complex approximate circuits","circuit error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["approximate computing","logical synthesis","genetic programming","formal methods"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel method allowing one to approximate complex arithmetic circuits with formal guarantees on the approximation error. The method integrates in a unique way formal techniques for approximate equivalence checking into a search-based circuit optimisation algorithm. The key idea of our approach is to employ a novel search strategy that drives the search towards promptly verifiable approximate circuits. The method was implemented within the ABC tool and extensively evaluated on functional approximation of multipliers (with up to 32-bit operands) and adders (with up to 128-bit operands). Within a few hours, we constructed a high-quality Pareto set of 32-bit multipliers providing trade-offs between the circuit error and size. This is for the first time when such complex approximate circuits with formal error guarantees have been derived, which demonstrates an outstanding performance and scalability of our approach compared with existing methods that have either been applied to the approximation of multipliers limited to 8-bit operands or statistical testing has been used only. Our approach thus significantly improves capabilities of the existing methods and paves a way towards an automated design process of provably-correct circuit approximations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203807","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203807.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximating complex arithmetic circuits with formal error guarantees: 32-bit multipliers accomplished","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Approximating complex arithmetic circuits with formal error guarantees: 32-bit multipliers accomplished","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203807/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430618","htmlLink":"/document/8203807/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximating complex arithmetic circuits with formal error guarantees: 32-bit multipliers accomplished","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"06A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133352S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203809,"authors":[{"name":"Jieru Zhao","affiliation":["ECE Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Jieru","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086280541"},{"name":"Liang Feng","affiliation":["ECE Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086280064"},{"name":"Sharad Sinha","affiliation":["SCSE, Nanyang Technological University"],"firstName":"Sharad","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37534467700"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085792715"},{"name":"Yun Liang","affiliation":["School of EECS, Peking University"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086277440"},{"name":"Bingsheng He","affiliation":["Department of CS, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Bingsheng","lastName":"He","id":"37532755800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203809","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1379},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203809","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Optimization","Pipeline processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Tools","Space exploration","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level synthesis","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level synthesis","synthesis pragmas","digital design","complex design descriptions","high-level languages","design description","pluggable analytical models","metric-guided design space exploration algorithm","HLS tools","Vivado HLS","Polybench benchmark applications","real-life applications","COMBA","comprehensive model-based analysis framework","recursive data collector","RDC","JPEG","Seidel","Rician"]}],"abstract":"High Level Synthesis (HLS) relies on the use of synthesis pragmas to generate digital designs meeting a set of specifications.

Several approaches have been proposed to identify the non-critical computations by analyzing the output sensitivity to the accuracy of the results, and then perform approximate computing on these computations. However, these static approaches only use the prior knowledge (e.g. input ranges) for analysis and fail to consider the runtime information, which limits the energy saving and incurs large computation error. In this paper, we propose a runtime approximate computing framework to solve this problem. The basic idea is to use a low cost method to estimate the impact of each immediate input value to the accuracy of computation at every node in the data flow graph, and then decide whether we should simply use the estimated value or perform an accurate computation. Our novel runtime estimation method is based on converting data to the logarithmic representation. We propose two algorithms to make the decision at certain nodes whether an accurate computation will be needed to balance energy saving and computation error. Experimental results show that this tradeoff ranges from 40% energy saving with 4.85% error on average to 8% energy saving with 0.18% error. Compared to the static DFG node cutting approach, our approach's estimation accuracy is 32x better to achieve the same amount of energy saving.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203811/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203811/","accessionNumber":"17418940","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient runtime approximate computing on data flow graphs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient runtime approximate computing on data flow graphs","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"06B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075722S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203812,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Liu","affiliation":["Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086109431"},{"name":"Zihao Liu","affiliation":["Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Zihao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086167171"},{"name":"Fuhong Lin","affiliation":["University of Science & Technology Beijing, Beijing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Fuhong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086279910"},{"name":"Yier Jin","affiliation":["University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Yier","lastName":"Jin","id":"37086281196"},{"name":"Gang Quan","affiliation":["Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Quan","id":"37086277410"},{"name":"Wujie Wen","affiliation":["Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Wujie","lastName":"Wen","id":"38466944200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203812","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Neurons","Nonhomogeneous media","Encoding","Neuromorphics","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MT-spike","modern deep learning","artificial neural networks","Deep Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network","enormous computation","storage requirements","deep network models","complex neural network models","Neuromorphic Computing System designs","theoretical learning approaches","inefficient neural processing","impracticable multilayer extension","practical multilayer time","practical time-coding scheme","average delay response model","temporal error backpropagation algorithm","efficient neural processing","flexible neural model size reduction","realistic recognition tasks","deep multilayer learning","multilayer time-based spiking neuromorphic architecture"]}],"abstract":"Modern deep learning enabled artificial neural networks, such as Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), have achieved a series of breaking records on a broad spectrum of recognition applications. However, the enormous computation and storage requirements associated with such deep and complex neural network models greatly challenge their implementations on resource-limited platforms. Time-based spiking neural network has recently emerged as a promising solution in Neuromorphic Computing System designs for achieving remarkable computing and power efficiency within a single chip. However, the relevant research activities have been narrowly concentrated on the biological plausibility and theoretical learning approaches, causing inefficient neural processing and impracticable multilayer extension thus significantly limitations on speed and accuracy when handling the realistic cognitive tasks. In this work, a practical multilayer time-based spiking neuromorphic architecture, namely \u201cMT-Spike\u201d, is developed to fill this gap. With the proposed practical time-coding scheme, average delay response model, temporal error backpropagation algorithm and heuristic loss function, \u201cMT-Spike\u201d achieves more efficient neural processing through flexible neural model size reduction while offering very competitive classification accuracy for realistic recognition tasks. Simulation results well validate that the algorithmic power of deep multilayer learning can be seamlessly merged with the efficiency of time-based spiking neuromorphic architecture, demonstrating

numerous artificial intelligent applications. However, the large sizes of DNNs make themselves both computation and memory intensive, thereby limiting the hardware performance of dedicated DNN accelerators. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework for energy-efficient high-performance highly-compressed DNN hardware design. First, we propose block-circulant matrix-based DNN training and inference schemes, which theoretically guarantee Big-O complexity reduction in both computational cost (from O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) to O(n log n)) and storage requirement (from O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) to O(n)) of DNNs. Second, we dedicatedly optimize the hardware architecture, especially on the key fast Fourier transform (FFT) module, to improve the overall performance in terms of energy efficiency, computation performance and resource cost. Third, we propose a design flow to perform hardware-software co-optimization with the purpose of achieving good balance between test accuracy and hardware performance of DNNs. Based on the proposed design flow, two block-circulant matrix-based DNNs on two different datasets are implemented and evaluated on FPGA. The fixed-point quantization and the proposed block-circulant matrix-based inference scheme enables the network to achieve as high as 3.5 TOPS computation performance and 3.69 TOPS/W energy efficiency while the memory is saved by 108X ~ 116X with negligible accuracy degradation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430533","htmlLink":"/document/8203813/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient, high-performance, highly-compressed deep neural network design using block-circulant matrices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient, high-performance, highly-compressed deep neural network design using block-circulant matrices","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"06B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090024S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203815,"authors":[{"name":"Bi Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085475392"},{"name":"Yuanqing Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085377171"},{"name":"Pengcheng Dai","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Dai","id":"37086334383"},{"name":"Jianlei Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianlei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085653591"},{"name":"Youguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086214193"},{"name":"Dijun Liu","affiliation":["China Academy of Telecommunication Technology(CATT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dijun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086330412"},{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy-of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085461978"},{"name":"Weisheng Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37536930400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203815","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203815","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-chip","Magnetic tunneling","Switches","Temperature distribution","Computer architecture","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","microprocessor chips","MRAM devices","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature gradient","ultra-low leakage","low power cache design","Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Memory","on-chip cache capacity","off-chip main memory enlarges","STT-MRAM based LLCs","write energy reduction","thermal aware NUCA architecture","thermal aware data migration policy","Last Level Cache","Chip-MultiProcessors","NonUniform Cache Access","NUCA design"]}],"abstract":"As the speed gap of the modern processor and the off-chip main memory enlarges, on-chip cache capacity increases to sustain the performance scaling. As a result, the cache power occupies a large portion of the total power budget. STT-MRAM (Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Memory) is proposed as a promising solution for the low power cache design due to its high integration density and ultra-low leakage. Nevertheless, the high write power and latency of STT-MRAM become new barriers for the commercialization of this emerging technology. In this paper, we investigate the thermal effect on the access performance of STT-MRAM and observe that the temperature can affect the write delay and energy significantly. Then, we explore the NUCA (Non-Uniform Cache Access) design of the CMPs (Chip-Multi-Processors)with STT-MRAM based LLC (Last Level Cache). A thermal aware data migration policy, called \u201cThermosiphon\u201d, which takes advantage of the thermal property of STT-MRAM, is proposed to reduce the LLC write energy.

In previous works, compact models of ICs were introduced to speed up the modeling process. However, such methods have limited accuracy as they approximate the underlying physics. They are also ill-suited to simulate the thermal characteristics of an IC at the cell-level. The finite element method (FEM) is an appropriate computational technique for providing both fast and accurate thermal analyses. Considering that the number of cells in modern ICs is on the order of millions, thermal analysis at this abstraction level is a formidable task. Consequently, handling the computational meshes and computing thermal profiles of an IC at the cell-level requires substantial computing power. In order to provide accurate cell-level thermal simulations at a lower computational cost, this work introduces advanced techniques that judiciously trade off mesh granularity with simulation accuracy which allows fast analysis of cell-level floorplans. The proposed cell-homogenization techniques start with a flat cell-level floorplan and a related power trace and produce reduced order meshes that accelerate thermal simulations with a negligible loss in accuracy. Results show that the proposed techniques achieve up to a 90% reduction in the number of nodes in the mesh with less than 5% error in the temperature compared to the full scale mesh. The simulation time is also reduced by an order of magnitude.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203817.pdf","startPage":"490","endPage":"495","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally efficient standard-cell FEM-based thermal analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal analysis","Computational modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Finite element analysis","Mathematical model","Heating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","integrated circuit layout","integrated circuit modelling","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal analysis","high performance computing problem","nanoscale spatiotemporal features","finite element method","abstraction level","computational meshes","cell-level floorplans","power trace","cell-level thermal simulations","thermal profiles","thermal characteristic simulation","compact IC modelling","large discrete problem","computationally efficient standard-cell FEM-based thermal analysis","thermal simulations","reduced order meshes","flat cell-level floorplan","cell-homogenization techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermal analysis","homogenization","DEF","LEF","FEM","Mesh"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient standard-cell FEM-based thermal analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203817/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430591","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient standard-cell FEM-based thermal analysis","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"06C4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069782S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203819,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Hao Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Hao","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085682663"},{"name":"Yao-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Wen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37279580700"},{"name":"Tung-Chieh Chen","affiliation":["Maxeda Technology Incorporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tung-Chieh","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290413600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203819","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":436},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203819","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","Optimization","Scalability","Complexity theory","Algorithm design and analysis","Data structures","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","integrated circuit layout","integrated circuit modelling","network routing","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["half-perimeter wirelength optimization","regularity penalty model","three-stage mixed-size placers","macroclustering","V-shaped multilevel frameworks","routability optimization","damped-wave constructive macroplacement framework","standard cell placement","standard-cell locations","macro-grouping cost model","standard-cell placer","\u039b-shaped multilevel frameworks","damped-wave multilevel framework"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a damped-wave constructive macro placement framework which packs big macros to optimize both wirelength and routability simultaneously.

However, the recent trend to design Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for achieving human-like cognitive abilities poses significant challenges towards the scalable design of neuromorphic systems (due to the increase in computation/storage demands). Network pruning [7] is a powerful technique to remove redundant connections for designing optimally connected (maximally sparse) DNNs. However, such pruning techniques induce irregular connections that are incoherent to the crossbar structure. Eventually they produce DNNs with highly inefficient hardware realizations (in terms of area and energy). In this work, we propose TraNNsformer - an integrated training framework that transforms DNNs to enable their efficient realization on MCA-based systems. TraNNsformer first prunes the connectivity matrix while forming clusters with the remaining connections. Subsequently, it retrains the network to fine tune the connections and reinforce the clusters. This is done iteratively to transform the original connectivity into an optimally pruned and maximally clustered mapping. We evaluated the proposed framework by transforming different Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on a wide range of datasets (MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR10) and executing them on MCA-based systems to analyze the area and energy benefits. Without accuracy loss, TraNNsformer reduces the area (energy) consumption by 28%-55% (49%-67%) with respect to the original network. Compared to network pruning, TraNNsformer achieves 28%-49% (15%-29%) area (energy) savings.

In recent years, memristor technology has been investigated in developing high-speed and large-capacity neural network chips. However, it has been observed that memristance values that represent the well-trained network weights can be disturbed by electrical or thermal perturbations. It severely degrades overall system reliability and emerges as a major design challenge. In this work, we systematically analyze the impacts of low-voltage induced memristance drift upon weight disturbance after times of recall operations. A closed-loop design by introducing a real-time feedback controller is proposed to enhance the weight stability of memristor based neural network chips. By mimicking the training process, the controller adaptively compensates the memristance deviation, according to the relation of the input data and recall output. In view of tiny disturbance per access, we integrate the memristance compensation into regular recall operation to avoid the execution speed degradation. Our simulations based on the implementation of representative single-layer (two-layer) network show that the proposed closed-loop design can prolong the service time of memristor-based neural network chip by 14.85x (14.94x), without reducing computational speed. Extra circuitry of the feedback controller induces a negligible overhead about 1.16% on overall power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203824","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203824.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A closed-loop design to enhance weight stability of memristor based neural network chips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A closed-loop design to enhance weight stability of memristor based neural network chips","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203824/","accessionNumber":"17430558","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A closed-loop design to enhance weight stability of memristor based neural network chips","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"07B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076832S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203825,"authors":[{"name":"Farnood Merrikh Bayat","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Farnood Merrikh","lastName":"Bayat","id":"37085590692"},{"name":"Mirko Prezioso","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mirko","lastName":"Prezioso","id":"37085424475"},{"name":"Bhaswar Chakrabarti","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bhaswar","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37085882900"},{"name":"Irina Kataeva","affiliation":["Advanced Research Division, DENSO CORPORATION, Komenoki-cho, Nisshin, Japan"],"firstName":"Irina","lastName":"Kataeva","id":"37313373200"},{"name":"Dmitri Strukov","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitri","lastName":"Strukov","id":"37295154200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203825","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":600},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203825","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Neurons","Memristors","Hardware","Threshold voltage","Neuromorphics","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristors","multilayer perceptrons","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inference operation","integrated hardware","larger crossbar arrays","memristor training schemes","hidden-layer neurons","implemented memristor","perceptron classifier","imperfect hardware","4\u00d74 binary images","mixed-signal neuromorphic network","MLP perceptron","20\u00d720 memristive crossbar arrays","discrete CMOS components","4 output-layer analog CMOS neurons","reported functional passive memristor classifier","0T1R","metal-oxide memristors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilayer Perceptron","Memristor","ReRAM","Crossbar Circuit","Artificial Neural Network","Pattern Classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203825","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203825.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristor-based perceptron classifier: Increasing complexity and coping with imperfect hardware","abstract":"We experimentally demonstrate classification of 4\u00d74 binary images into 4 classes, using a 3-layer mixed-signal neuromorphic network (\u201cMLP perceptron\u201d), based on two passive 20\u00d720 memristive crossbar arrays, board-integrated with discrete CMOS components.

To deal with larger crossbar arrays, we have developed a semiautomatic approach to their forming and testing, and compared several memristor training schemes for coping with imperfect behavior of these devices, as well as with variability of analog CMOS neurons. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes for defect and variation tolerance was verified experimentally using the implemented network and, additionally, by modeling the operation of a larger network, with 300 hidden-layer neurons, on the MNIST benchmark.

Parallelization is a promising direction to accelerate the routing. While synchronous parallelization can converge a feasible solution, the ideal speedup is rarely achieved due to excessive communication overheads. Asynchronous parallelization can provide an almost linear speedup, but it is difficult to converge in the limited number of iterations due to net dependency. In this paper we propose SAPRoute, which coordinates synchronous and asynchronous parallelism on distributed multiprocessing environment to accelerate the routing for FPGAs. The objective is to boost the more speedup of parallel routing algorithm under the requirement of convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the impact of synchronization and asynchronization during parallelization. Experimental results show that our approach have negligible explicit synchronization overhead and achieves significant speedup improvement over a set of commonly used benchmarks. Notably, SAPRoute produces the speedup of 24.27\u00d7 on average compared to the default serial solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coordinated synchronous and asynchronous parallel routing approach for FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203829","startPage":"577","endPage":"584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203829.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A coordinated synchronous and asynchronous parallel routing approach for FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203829/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430549","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coordinated synchronous and asynchronous parallel routing approach for FPGAs","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"08A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082289S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203834,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanwei Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, USA"],"firstName":"Zhanwei","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37086288746"},{"name":"Zipeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, USA"],"firstName":"Zipeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085374743"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203834","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Microelectrodes","Liquids","Software","Real-time systems","DNA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biological techniques","bioMEMS","drops","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MEDA DMFB","fine-grained error-recovery solutions","MEDA-specific droplet operations","adaptive droplet-aliquot operations","microelectrode-dot-array","on-chip sensors","droplet volume","biochemistry labs","digital microfluidic biochips","predictive analysis","MEDA biochips","adaptive error recovery","error-recovery strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["micro-electrode-dot-array","digital microfluidics","error recovery","droplet-aliquot operations","predictive analysis"]}],"abstract":"Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are being increasingly used in biochemistry labs for automating bioassays.

They offer high energy efficiency and massive parallelism due to the distributed and asynchronous nature of neural computation through low-energy spikes. One such platform is the IBM TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System. Recently TrueNorth compatible representation learning algorithms have emerged, achieving close to state-of-the-art performance in various datasets. An exception is its application in temporal sequence processing models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which is still at the proof of concept level. This is partly due to the hardware constraints in connectivity and syn-aptic weight resolution, and the inherent difficulty in capturing temporal dynamics of an RNN using spiking neurons. This work presents a design flow that overcomes the aforementioned difficulties and maps a special case of recurrent networks called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) onto a spike-based platform. The framework is built on top of various approximation techniques, weight and activation discretization, spiking neuron sub-circuits that implements the complex gating mechanisms and a store-and-release technique to enable neuron synchronization and faithful storage. While many of the techniques can be applied to map LSTM to any SNN simulator/emulator, here we demonstrate this approach on the TrueNorth chip adhering to its constraints. Two benchmark LSTM applications, parity check and Extended Reber Grammar, are evaluated and their accuracy, energy and speed tradeoffs are analyzed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spike-based long short-term memory on a neurosynaptic processor","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203836","endPage":"637","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203836.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","startPage":"631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203836","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Hardware","Recurrent neural networks","Axons","Synchronization","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","storage management chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurosynaptic processor","low-power brain-inspired hardware systems","high energy efficiency","massive parallelism","neural computation","IBM TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System","TrueNorth compatible representation learning algorithms","recurrent neural networks","spiking neurons","neuron synchronization","LSTM","spike-based long short-term memory","parity check","Extended Reber Grammar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spiking Neural Networks","Recurrent Neural Networks","Long Short-Term Memory","Neuromorphic Hardware"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A spike-based long short-term memory on a neurosynaptic processor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203836/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430536","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spike-based long short-term memory on a neurosynaptic processor","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"08C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065767S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8203837,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Yang","affiliation":["University of Michigan-Shanghai, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086308435"},{"name":"John P.

It has gained attention recently because of the very low area and power needs of its computing core. SC relies on stochastic number generators (SNGs) to map input binary numbers to stochastic bit streams. A conventional SNG comprises a random number source (RNS), typically an LFSR, and a comparator. It needs far more area and power than the SC core, offsetting the latter's main advantages. To mitigate this problem, SNGs employing emerging nanoscale devices such as memristors and spintronic devices have been proposed. However, these devices tend to have large errors in their output probabilities due to unpredictable variations in their fabrication processes and noise in their control signals. We present a novel method of exploiting such devices to design a highly accurate SNG. It is built around an RNS that generates uniformly distributed random numbers under ideal (nominal) conditions. It also has a novel error-cancelling probability conversion circuit (ECPCC) that guarantees very high accuracy in the output probability under realistic conditions when the RNS is subject to errors. An ECPCC can also be used to generate maximally correlated stochastic streams, a useful property for some applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203837","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203837.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","startPage":"638","endPage":"644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of accurate stochastic number generators with noisy emerging devices for stochastic computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of accurate stochastic number generators with noisy emerging devices for stochastic computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203837/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430509","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203837/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of accurate stochastic number generators with noisy emerging devices for stochastic computing","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"08C4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069451S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203838,"authors":[{"name":"Tengtao Li","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN"],"firstName":"Tengtao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086310609"},{"name":"Sachin S.

Unfortunately, many are susceptible to write endurance challenges, resulting in stuck-at faults. Existing mitigation methods statically partition and invert data within a block containing such faults (partition-and-flip) to ensure data is written to match stuck-at cells such that they may remain in service. Unfortunately, these schemes have limited fault tolerance capabilities and require the assumption that their auxiliary bits are fault free. We propose a dynamic partitioning scheme that improves the number of tolerated stuck-at faults and simultaneously protects auxiliary bits. Dynamic partitioning can significantly improve the fault tolerance over existing static partitioning approaches with an equal number of auxiliary bits. Moreover, it can often still improve fault tolerance while reducing the number of auxiliary bits. Compared to flip-N-write and Aegis, a leading mitigation scheme, dynamic partitioning can achieve 7-72% and 5-53 x lower write error rates, respectively, for the same capacity overhead with a stuck-at-fault rate of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203839.pdf","startPage":"651","endPage":"658","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic partitioning to mitigate stuck-at faults in emerging memories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Phase change materials","Encoding","Two dimensional displays","Random access memory","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","integrated circuit reliability","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mitigation methods","fault tolerance capabilities","dynamic partitioning scheme","static partitioning approaches","stuck-at-fault rate","nonvolatile memories","mitigation scheme","stuck-at cells","auxiliary bit protection","write error rates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Emerging Memories","Reliability","Stuck-at Faults","Dynamic PartitioninEmerging Memories","Reliability","Stuck-at Faults","Dynamic Partitioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic partitioning to mitigate stuck-at faults in emerging memories","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203839/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430560","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic partitioning to mitigate stuck-at faults in emerging memories","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"09A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092524S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203843,"authors":[{"name":"Yeseong Kim","affiliation":["University of California San Diego"],"firstName":"Yeseong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085640764"},{"name":"Pietro Mercati","affiliation":["University of California San Diego"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Mercati","id":"37071712500"},{"name":"Ankit More","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"More","id":"37403964400"},{"name":"Emily Shriver","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Shriver","id":"38180981800"},{"name":"Tajana Rosing","affiliation":["University of California San Diego"],"firstName":"Tajana","lastName":"Rosing","id":"37086117573"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203843","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":445},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Power demand","Clustering algorithms","Computational modeling","Servers","Biological system modeling","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","neural nets","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Performance Prediction framework","cross-platform application power","heterogeneous computing systems","CPU architecture","Internet of Things","source code/binaries","machine-independent application phases","energy efficiency","Phase-based power/performance prediction","performance counter measurements","benchmark phase","complex cross-platform relationships","neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power prediction","performance prediction","phase recognition","neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203843","abstract":"The emergence of Internet of Things increases the complexity and the heterogeneity of computing platforms.

However, the side effect is that many architectural details are hidden from the programmers. As a result, programmers who wish to improve the performance of their design often have difficulty identifying the performance bottleneck. It is true that current HLS tools provide some estimate of the performance with a fixed loop count, but they often fail to do so for programs with input-dependent execution behavior. Also, their external memory latency model does not accurately fit the actual bus-based shared memory architecture. This work describes a high-level cycle estimation methodology to solve these problems. To reduce the time overhead, we propose a cycle estimation process that is combined with the HLS software simulation. We also present an automatic code instrumentation technique that finds the reason for stall accurately in on-board execution. The experimental results show that our framework provides a cycle estimate with an average error rate of 1.1% and 5.0% for compute- and DRAM-bound modules, respectively, for ADM-PCIE-7V3 board. The proposed metmethodhod is about two orders of magnitude faster than the FPGA bitstream generation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203844","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203844.pdf","startPage":"691","endPage":"698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HLScope+,: Fast and accurate performance estimation for FPGA HLS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"HLScope+,: Fast and accurate performance estimation for FPGA HLS","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430585","htmlLink":"/document/8203844/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HLScope+,: Fast and accurate performance estimation for FPGA HLS","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"09B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106544S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203848,"authors":[{"name":"Kiruba Sankaran Subramani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kiruba Sankaran","lastName":"Subramani","id":"37085679508"},{"name":"Angelos Antonopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Angelos","lastName":"Antonopoulos","id":"38202605700"},{"name":"Ahmed Attia Abotabl","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed Attia","lastName":"Abotabl","id":"37085799919"},{"name":"Aria Nosratinia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Aria","lastName":"Nosratinia","id":"37269740500"},{"name":"Yiorgos Makris","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yiorgos","lastName":"Makris","id":"37274481400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203848","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203848","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Trojan horses","Fading channels","Integrated circuits","Wireless LAN","Transceivers","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computer network security","cryptography","invasive software","OFDM modulation","radio transceivers","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["device noise","adaptive channel estimation defense mechanism","printed circuit board","transmission power characteristics","WLAN transceivers","defense method","hardware Trojans","wireless local area network transceivers","receiver side","channel estimation capabilities","adaptive approach","channel conditions","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","wireless open-access research platform","analog-RF trojan detetion","analog-RF circuitry","HT activity","PCB","WARP","power amplifier","PA"]}],"abstract":"We propose a defense method capable of detecting hardware Trojans (HTs) in the analog/RF circuitry of wireless local area network (WLAN) transceivers.

Die-level integration technologies like passive interposer-based 2.5D have demonstrated the potential for cost reductions through die partitioning and yield improvement, but system performance and scalability may be impacted. Alternatively, active interposer technology, the intersection of 3D and 2.5D methodologies, can provide higher-performance interconnect networks to integrate chiplets, but the active interposer die is itself subject to cost and yield concerns. In this work, we perform a cost and performance comparison between traditional monolithic 2D SoCs, 2.5D passive interposers, and 2.5D/3D active interposers to demonstrate the trade-offs between the interposer types for current and future high-performance systems. This work introduces a multi-die core-binning cost model to demonstrate the yield improvements from interposer-based die partitioning of large multi-core processors. The relative cost and performance scaling trade-offs of passive and active interposer dies are then compared for the target systems, demonstrating that both methodologies can indeed provide cost-effective integration for different system requirements. Finally, this work demonstrates how the extra \u201cprepaid\u201d silicon area of the interposers can be leveraged for fault tolerance to improve yield and cost-effectiveness. In summary, this work concludes that both active and passive interposers can cost-effectively improve the functional and parametric yield of high-performance systems, together providing a cost versus performance space to meet a range of design requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203849","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203849.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","startPage":"728","endPage":"735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cost-effective design of scalable high-performance systems using active and passive interposers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203849/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17430610","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-effective design of scalable high-performance systems using active and passive interposers","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092171S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203850,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Deng","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technolog, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Deng","id":"37085837130"},{"name":"Youtao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Youtao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086335784"},{"name":"Minxuan Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technolog, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Minxuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086308886"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085482592"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203850","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Random access memory","Graphics processing units","Registers","Computer architecture","Bandwidth","Magnetic tunneling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","graphics processing units","integrated circuit design","magnetoelectronics","MRAM devices","scheduling","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coarse-grained hybrid design","fast context-switch","SRAM RF","SRAM buffer","warp-scheduler friendly hybrid RF design","RF banks","concurrent context-switching","LRR warp scheduler","loose round robin warp scheduler","energy consumption reduction","silent data transfer","cell level integration","HC-RF structure","long STT-RAM write latency","spin transfer torque magnetic memory","SRAM-STT-RAM hybrid cell structure","warp-scheduler friendly STT-RAM-SRAM hybrid GPGPU register file design","round robin scheduler","graphics processing units"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203850","abstract":"Modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) widely adopt large SRAM based register file (RF) to enable fast context-switch. A large SRAM RF may consume 20% to 40% GPU power, which has become one of the major design challenges for GPUs. Recent studies mitigate the issue through hybrid RF designs that architect a large STT-RAM (Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic memory) RF and a small SRAM buffer. However, the long STT-RAM write latency throttles the data exchange between STT-RAM and SRAM, which deprecates warp scheduler with frequent context switches, e.g., round robin scheduler. In this paper, we propose HC-RF, a warp-scheduler friendly hybrid RF design using novel SRAM/STT-RAM hybrid cell (HC) structure. HC-RF exploits cell level integration to improve the effective bandwidth between STT-RAM and SRAM. By enabling silent data transfer from SRAM to STT-RAM without blocking RF banks, HC-RF supports concurrent context-switching and decouples its dependency on warp scheduler. Our experimental results show that, on average, HC-RF achieves 50% performance improvement and 44% energy consumption reduction over the coarse-grained hybrid design when adopting LRR(Loose Round Robin) warp scheduler.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203850.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203850","startPage":"736","endPage":"742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards warp-scheduler friendly STT-RAM/SRAM hybrid GPGPU register file design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203850/","displayDocTitle":"Towards warp-scheduler friendly STT-RAM/SRAM hybrid GPGPU register file design","htmlLink":"/document/8203850/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17430599","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards warp-scheduler friendly STT-RAM/SRAM hybrid GPGPU register file design","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101218S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203852,"authors":[{"name":"Jiachen Mao","affiliation":["Duke University, USA"],"firstName":"Jiachen","lastName":"Mao","id":"37085858386"},{"name":"Zhongda Yang","affiliation":["University of Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongda","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086274483"},{"name":"Wei Wen","affiliation":["Duke University, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wen","id":"37085427457"},{"name":"Chunpeng Wu","affiliation":["Duke University, USA"],"firstName":"Chunpeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086279333"},{"name":"Linghao Song","affiliation":["Duke University, USA"],"firstName":"Linghao","lastName":"Song","id":"37086275676"},{"name":"Kent W.

Experimental results show that, GTDP can accelerate the original DNN execution time by 1.86-2.44x with 2-4 worker nodes.

With growing problem size and complexity, modern NNs, e.g., CNNs (Convolutional NNs) and DNNs (Deep NNs), contain a large number of weights, which require tremendous efforts not only to prepare representative training datasets but also to train the network. There is an increasing demand to protect the NN weight matrices, an emerging Intellectual Property (IP) in NN field. Unfortunately, adopting conventional encryption method faces significant performance and energy consumption overheads. In this paper, we propose AEP, a DianNao based NN accelerator design for IP protection. AEP aggressively reduces DRAM timing to generate a device dependent error mask, i.e., a set of erroneous cells while the distribution of these cells are device dependent due to process variations. AEP incorporates the error mask in the NN training process so that the trained weights are device dependent, which effectively defects IP piracy as exporting the weights to other devices cannot produce satisfactory inference accuracy. In addition, AEP speeds up NN inference and achieves significant energy reduction due to the fact that main memory dominates the energy consumption in DianNao accelerator. Our evaluation results show that by injecting 0.1% to 5% memory errors, AEP has negligible inference accuracy loss on the target device while exhibiting unacceptable accuracy degradation on other devices. In addition, AEP achieves an average of 72% performance improvement and 44% energy reduction over the DianNao baseline.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203854","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM

presented for the first time, with new compact transistor aging models and upgraded circuit reliability simulator. Our work solves various issues found in FinFET silicon data of NBTI aging. Especially, instead of ignoring or less accurate NBTI recovery effect model in traditional simulators, accurate NBTI degradation and recovery models are proposed and validated by silicon data for full stress/recovery range in the FinFET technology. The history effect, one of the important features of NBTI which is missing in the existing industrial tools, is included based on new simulation methodology. Since FinFET reliability data suggests the conventional linear extrapolation method is no longer valid, an accurate fast-speed long-term prediction method is proposed based on smart iteration flows of equivalence. The frequency dependence of NBTI, which draws much attention, is included in the new simulator automatically. This work has been integrated into Cadence reliability simulator, providing designers an opportunity for accurate reliability-aware circuit design.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","startPage":"780","endPage":"785","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203856","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203856.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards reliability-aware circuit design in nanoscale FinFET technology: \u2014 New-generation aging model and circuit reliability simulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203856/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Towards reliability-aware circuit design in nanoscale FinFET technology: \u2014 New-generation aging model and circuit reliability simulator","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430506","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203856/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards reliability-aware circuit design in nanoscale FinFET technology: \u2014 New-generation aging model and circuit reliability simulator","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10D2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112973S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203857,"authors":[{"name":"Hongge Chen","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, EECS Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hongge","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086309732"},{"name":"Duane Boning","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, EECS Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Duane","lastName":"Boning","id":"37282379500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203857","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":830},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203857","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packaging","Measurement","Testing","Manufacturing processes","Integrated circuits","Dies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronics packaging","integrated circuit manufacture","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","production engineering computing","quality control","semiconductor industry","semiconductor technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["competitive semiconductor manufacturing industry","machine learning models","semiconductor manufacturing processes","packaging","testing process","chip stack flash memory","significant yield improvement potential","incremental machine learning approaches","IC yield improvement","die stack case","data driven quality control technologies"]}],"abstract":"In the competitive semiconductor manufacturing industry where large amounts of data are generated, data driven quality control technologies are gaining increasing importance.

We study the packaging and testing process in chip stack flash memory as an application, and show the possibility of yield improvement with machine learning based classifiers detecting bad dies before packaging. Experimental results demonstrate significant yield improvement potential using real data from industry. Without concept drift, for stacks of 8 dies, an approximately 9% yield improvement can be achieved.

However, CNNs introduce massive computing overhead due to their complex network computing flow, resulting in significantly reduced applicability and performance, especially in the mobile devices. Various optimization schemes have been proposed mainly based on both model compression and stacked external computing resources. While these schemes have been proven effective, methods which take into account mobile-specific context-aware optimization approaches have been largely overlooked. One such opportunity is the feasible CNN computing flow simplification to the under-test objects with distinguish features, which can be efficiently pre-analyzed inside the mobile sensor system. Hence, we propose VoCaM, a visualization oriented CNN acceleration framework on mobile devices for image classification tasks. VoCaM takes advantage of the mobile camera system, where the comprehensive pre-analysis can be conducted to reveal the color composition of the under-test images without incurring any additional overhead. Also, the visualization analysis of VoCaM reveals that, certain color-specific filters may have very trivial result impact when the under-test images have mismatching primary color components. Then a set of approximate computing methods is applied to these insignificant filters to replace the intensive convolutional operation, and greatly accelerate the computing process. With ignorable overhead, VoCaM can significantly optimize the computation load of the convolutional layers, with very small impact on the overall classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203864","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203864.pdf","startPage":"835","endPage":"840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"VoCaM: Visualization oriented convolutional neural network acceleration on mobile system: Invited paper","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430541","htmlLink":"/document/8203864/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VoCaM: Visualization oriented convolutional neural network acceleration on mobile system: Invited paper","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"S02D1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068361S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203872,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichi Nakamura","affiliation":["System Platform Research Labs., NEC Corp., Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37086276437"},{"name":"Hideyuki Shimonishi","affiliation":["System Platform Research Labs., NEC Corp., Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideyuki","lastName":"Shimonishi","id":"37282416000"},{"name":"Yuki Kobayashi","affiliation":["System Platform Research Labs., NEC Corp., Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37086276893"},{"name":"Kozo Satoda","affiliation":["System Platform Research Labs., NEC Corp., Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kozo","lastName":"Satoda","id":"37593305000"},{"name":"Yashuhiro Matsunaga","affiliation":["System Platform Research Labs., NEC Corp., Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yashuhiro","lastName":"Matsunaga","id":"37086278663"},{"name":"Dai Kanetomo","affiliation":["System Platform Research Labs., NEC Corp., Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Dai","lastName":"Kanetomo","id":"37085750400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203872","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","5G mobile communication","Throughput","Bit rate","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Big Data","Internet of Things","parallel processing","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social systems","5G communications","complicated Big Data","complex IoT systems","high performance heterocomputing","high-speed communication systems","efficient network systems","efficient computer systems","Internet of Things","IoT applications","heterogeneous computing platforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IoT","5G","Heterogeneous Computing"]}],"abstract":"IoT(Internet of Things), which collects various data in real world and analyzes values from collected data is one of good methods to help solve such serious problems and to construct efficient social systems.

Recently, image analysis is being actively applied for medical diagnosis and treatment, in which image segmentation is of the fundamental importance for other image processing such as visualization and detection. However, given the tasks challenges in transmitting large volume of high-resolution images and the real-time constraints that are commonly present for mobile telemedicine, image segmentation is best done at the \u201cedge\u201d, i.e., locally so that only segmentation results are communicated. A powerful approach to medical image segmentation is cellular neural network (CeNN), which can achieve very high accuracy through proper training. However, CeNNs typically involve extensive computations in a recursive manner. As an example, to simply process an image of 1920\u00d71080 pixels requires 4-8 Giga floating point multiplications (for 3\u00d73 templates and 50-100 iterations), which needs to be done in a timely manner for real-time medical image segmentation. Such a demand is too high for most low power mobile computing platforms in IoTs, This paper presents a compressed CeNN framework for computation reduction in CeNNs, which is the first in the literature. It involves various techniques such as early exit and parameter quantization, which significantly reduces computation demands while maintaining an acceptable performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203873/","accessionNumber":"17430507","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203873/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Edge segmentation: Empowering mobile telemedicine with compressed cellular neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge segmentation: Empowering mobile telemedicine with compressed cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"S04D2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098184S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8203874,"authors":[{"name":"Jinyang Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinyang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085417204"},{"name":"Qingwei Guo","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qingwei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086279748"},{"name":"Fang Su","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Su","id":"37085612490"},{"name":"Zhe Yuan","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085742848"},{"name":"Jinshan Yue","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinshan","lastName":"Yue","id":"37085863395"},{"name":"Jingtong Hu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jingtong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37309334200"},{"name":"Huazhong Yang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huazhong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085350161"},{"name":"Yongpan Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongpan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292036600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203874","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":457},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CNN-based pattern recognition on nonvolatile IoT platform for smart ultraviolet monitoring: (Invited paper)","abstract":"Intelligent computing and maintenance-free powering are two desirable characteristics of wearable IoT devices. Energy harvesting nonvolatile intelligent processor (NIP) with neural network computation capability has the potential to advance these goals. Individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure monitoring progressively becomes one conspicuous application of wearable devices. In resource constrained wearable sensor nodes, we can alleviate the data transmission burden via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based pattern recognition. Nevertheless, in spite of the substantially improved computing capability of NIP, typically computational and memory intensive CNNs are still too bulky for on-node implementation. We develop an CNN-based pattern recognition system for nonvolatile IoT platform for smart UV monitoring, and propose a optimization method to achieve extremely tiny and efficient CNNs.

Several approaches have been proposed to identify the non-critical computations by analyzing the output sensitivity to the accuracy of the results, and then perform approximate computing on these computations. However, these static approaches only use the prior knowledge (e.g. input ranges) for analysis and fail to consider the runtime information, which limits the energy saving and incurs large computation error. In this paper, we propose a runtime approximate computing framework to solve this problem. The basic idea is to use a low cost method to estimate the impact of each immediate input value to the accuracy of computation at every node in the data flow graph, and then decide whether we should simply use the estimated value or perform an accurate computation. Our novel runtime estimation method is based on converting data to the logarithmic representation. We propose two algorithms to make the decision at certain nodes whether an accurate computation will be needed to balance energy saving and computation error. Experimental results show that this tradeoff ranges from 40% energy saving with 4.85% error on average to 8% energy saving with 0.18% error. Compared to the static DFG node cutting approach, our approach's estimation accuracy is 32x better to achieve the same amount of energy saving.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203876","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203876.pdf","startPage":"902","endPage":"907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient runtime approximate computing on data flow graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient runtime approximate computing on data flow graphs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430594","htmlLink":"/document/8203876/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient runtime approximate computing on data flow graphs","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"S06B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079322S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203877,"authors":[{"name":"Elliott Delaye","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Elliott","lastName":"Delaye","id":"37086291366"},{"name":"Ashish Sirasao","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Sirasao","id":"37846073700"},{"name":"Chaithanya Dudha","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Chaithanya","lastName":"Dudha","id":"37086294598"},{"name":"Sabya Das","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Sabya","lastName":"Das","id":"37085826837"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203877","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":818},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Field programmable gate arrays","Quantization (signal)","Arrays","Acceleration","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","learning (artificial intelligence)","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning tasks","high performance applications","Xilinx","programmable logic","deep learning applications","deep learning system","architectural choices","FPGA fabric","DSP","memories"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we will describe the architectural, software, performance, and implementation challenges and solutions and current research on the use of programmable logic to enable deep learning applications.

With growing complexity, diverse design objectives, high heterogeneity, and evolving technologies, further, modern FPGA placement and routing bring up many emerging research opportunities. In this paper, we introduce basic architectures of FPGAs, describe the placement and routing problems for FPGAs, and explain key techniques to solve the problems (including three major placement paradigms: partitioning, simulated annealing, and analytical placement; two routing paradigms: sequential and concurrent routing, and simultaneous placement and routing).

Shared coherent cache based CPU-FPGA platforms, like Intel HARP, are a particularly promising example of such systems with enhanced efficiency and high flexibility. In this work, we propose a hybrid strategy that relies on both static analysis of applications and dynamic control of cache based on static analysis to minimize the contention on the FPGA cache in the emerging CPU-FPGA platforms with shared coherent caches. In the static analysis, we analyze memory access patterns of the accelerated kernels on FPGA using reuse distance theory and generate kernel characteristics called Key values. Thereafter, a dynamic scheme for cache bypassing and partitioning control based on these Key values is developed to increase the cache hit rate and improve the performance. We validate our proposed strategy using a system-level architectural simulator for CPU-FPGA heterogeneous computing systems. Experiments show that the proposed strategy can increase the cache hit rate by 22.90% on average and speed up the application by up to 12.52% with negligible area overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430537","htmlLink":"/document/8203881/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid approach to cache management in heterogeneous CPU-FPGA platforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid approach to cache management in heterogeneous CPU-FPGA platforms","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"S06D5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081859S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203882,"authors":[{"name":"Xun Jiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UC San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37085539458"},{"name":"Mulong Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mulong","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086320702"},{"name":"Jeng-Hau Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UC San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeng-Hau","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085365246"},{"name":"Rajesh K.

This success has even led to implementation of neural network algorithms into hardware. In this paper, we explore two questions: (a) to what extent microelectronic variations affects the quality of results by neural networks; and (b) if the answer to first question represents an opportunity to optimize the implementation of neural network algorithms. Regarding first question, variations are now increasingly common in aggressive process nodes and typically manifest as an increased frequency of timing errors. Combating variations - due to process and/or operating conditions - usually results in increased guardbands in circuit and architectural design, thus reducing the gains from process technology advances. Given the inherent resilience of neural networks due to adaptation of their learning parameters, one would expect the quality of results produced by neural networks to be relatively insensitive to the rising timing error rates caused by increased variations. On the contrary, using two frequently used neural networks (MLP and CNN), our results show that variations can significantly affect the inference accuracy. This paper outlines our assessment methodology and use of a cross-layer evaluation approach that extracts hardware-level errors from twenty different operating conditions and then inject such errors back to the software layer in an attempt to answer the second question posed above.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203882","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203882.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An assessment of vulnerability of hardware neural networks to dynamic voltage and temperature variations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An assessment of vulnerability of hardware neural networks to dynamic voltage and temperature variations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430598","htmlLink":"/document/8203882/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An assessment of vulnerability of hardware neural networks to dynamic voltage and temperature variations","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"S07C1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097777S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203891,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungwook Chang","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Kyungwook","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085638842"},{"name":"Bon Woong Ku","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Bon Woong","lastName":"Ku","id":"37085413546"},{"name":"Saurabh Sinha","affiliation":["ARM Inc., Austin, TX"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37289905800"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Lim","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Sung Kyu","lastName":"Lim","id":"37085496698"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3094-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"8203891","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-chip monolithic 3D IC design and power performance analysis with ASAP7 library: (Invited Paper)","abstract":"In this paper, we present full-chip designs and their power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics using the ASAP7 process design kit (PDK) and library.

Drivers are the trend to 3D integration, the addition of design goals such as ultra-low power and safety, and an increasing number of designs in IoT and automotive areas. EDA tools such as high-level synthesis cover a small design area only. Also, the impact of IP reuse is overestimated since IP integration often requires complex configuration and additional software to be developed. To continuously increase design productivity, Infineon heavily relies on an in-house automation framework that utilizes Python as language for automation and synthesis. It supports (and makes use of) classical HDSLs to describe specific design aspects. Mostly structured specification formalisms such as tables, requirements or diagrams (e.g. SysML subsets) are used. These formalisms can be seen as HDSLs with the additional benefit that they exist as a result of a specification process, i.e. need not be coded explicitly. To be able to deal with several formalisms, Infineon's automation framework follows OMG's MDA vision and utilizes meta-models e.g. for generation of infrastructure code. This work focuses on the aspect of combining DSLs, defining a formal semantic for HDSLs and using this definition to validate the correctness of the mapping of HDSLs to HDLs, an essential pillar to connect HDSLs to today's design flows.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203893","startPage":"1019","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08203893.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203893","endPage":"1025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Python based framework for HDSLs with an underlying formal semantics: (Invited paper)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Python based framework for HDSLs with an underlying formal semantics: (Invited paper)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203893/","accessionNumber":"17430620","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Python based framework for HDSLs with an underlying formal semantics: (Invited paper)","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"S09C2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103486S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8203894,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Reiche","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Reiche","id":"37085499302"},{"name":"M.

Since a DSL separates the algorithm description from the actual target implementation, it offers a high flexibility among heterogeneous hardware targets, such as CPUs and GPUs. With the recent uprise of promising High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools, like Vivado HLS and Altera OpenCL, FPGAs are becoming another attractive target architecture. Particularly in the domain of image processing, applications often come with stringent requirements regarding performance, energy efficiency, and power, for which FPGA have been proven to be among the most suitable architectures. In this work, we present the Hipacc framework, a DSL and source-to-source compiler for image processing. We show that domain knowledge can be captured to generate tailored implementations for C-based HLS from a common high-level DSL description targeting FPGAs. Our approach includes FPGA-specific memory architectures for handling point and local operators, as well as several high-level transformations.

With growing problem size and complexity, modern NNs, e.g., CNNs (Convolutional NNs) and DNNs (Deep NNs), contain a large number of weights, which require tremendous efforts not only to prepare representative training datasets but also to train the network. There is an increasing demand to protect the NN weight matrices, an emerging Intellectual Property (IP) in NN field. Unfortunately, adopting conventional encryption method faces significant performance and energy consumption overheads. In this paper, we propose AEP, a DianNao based NN accelerator design for IP protection. AEP aggressively reduces DRAM timing to generate a device dependent error mask, i.e., a set of erroneous cells while the distribution of these cells are device dependent due to process variations. AEP incorporates the error mask in the NN training process so that the trained weights are device dependent, which effectively defects IP piracy as exporting the weights to other devices cannot produce satisfactory inference accuracy. In addition, AEP speeds up NN inference and achieves significant energy reduction due to the fact that main memory dominates the energy consumption in DianNao accelerator. Our evaluation results show that by injecting 0.1% to 5% memory errors, AEP has negligible inference accuracy loss on the target device while exhibiting unacceptable accuracy degradation on other devices. In addition, AEP achieves an average of 72% performance improvement and 44% energy reduction over the DianNao baseline.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203897/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17430504","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203897/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"AEP: An error-bearing neural network accelerator for energy efficiency and model protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AEP: An error-bearing neural network accelerator for energy efficiency and model protection","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"S10C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068844S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167715","isNumber":"8203744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167715","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8203744","articleId":"8203897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8203905,"authors":[{"name":"Ranjeet Singh Chauhan","affiliation":["National Institute of Technical Teachers' Training and Research Chandigarh, Chandigarh, Chandigarh, IN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8123903/8203898/8203905/8203905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mr. Ranjeet Singh Chauhan: Mr Ranjeet Singh Chauhan is currently pursuing M.E. from National Institute of Technical Teachers' Training and Research, Chandigarh India.

The benefits to use this representation are reduction in the computational complexity, hardware requirement which ultimately reduces the area requirement and power consumption. The structures are employed to design this IIR Butterworth low pass filter on Cadence platform. The Verilog language is used for coding purpose for given filter specification. The filter specification such as cut off frequency, sampling frequency is chosen according to Electrocardiogram application i.e 100 Hz and 1 kHz respectively. The main objective of this paper is to give a comparison between Direct Form I structure and Direct Form II structure on the basis of power consumption, area requirement and Speed. Simulation results show that Direct form II structure of filter is 20% faster than Direct Form I.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203905","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08203905.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASIC design of IIR butterworth digital filter for electrocardiogram","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203905/","displayDocTitle":"ASIC design of IIR butterworth digital filter for electrocardiogram","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17418543","htmlLink":"/document/8203905/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASIC design of IIR butterworth digital filter for electrocardiogram","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049758S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8203905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203907,"authors":[{"name":"Pampee Das","affiliation":["Dept.of ECE, NEHU, Shillong, India"],"firstName":"Pampee","lastName":"Das","id":"37086277438"},{"name":"Rupaban Subadar","affiliation":["Dept.of ECE, NEHU, Shillong, India"],"firstName":"Rupaban","lastName":"Subadar","id":"37393062300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8203907","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"abstract":"A general expression for the bit-error rate (BER) performance of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), have been presented in this paper, considering arbitrary branch Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) Receiver, over two-wave diffuse power (TWDP) Fading Channels.

Thus, context aware recommender systems are used for providing recommendations. As recommender systems suffers from cold start, sparse data and scalability problems. Therefore, artificial neural networks (ANN) are used to solve these problems. But, training of ANN again takes a very large time, due to high dimensional features. Hence, feature subset selection is done to solve this problem. But, it is a kind of combinatorial optimization problem, which could be solved by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO with heuristic function as fuzzy values obtained after applying fuzzy c means clustering algorithm over movie lens data set provided optimum results. Back propagation algorithm has been used, for the training of neural network, only on those features which are obtained after applying modified ACO along with roulette wheel selection algorithm. Results are analyzed by providing ratings of those movies which are not provided in \u201cmovie lens data set\u201d yet, as a solution to cold start problem. Finally, the accuracy of recommender systems is calculated by determining mean absolute error and comparison is provided with other previous approaches for different data sets.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203914","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08203914.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective approach of feature selection for recommender systems using fuzzy C means clustering along with ant colony optimization and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"An effective approach of feature selection for recommender systems using fuzzy C means clustering along with ant colony optimization and neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17428915","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203914/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective approach of feature selection for recommender systems using fuzzy C means clustering along with ant colony optimization and neural networks","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055118S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8203914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8203915,"authors":[{"name":"Ayush Ashish Shirsat","affiliation":["Dubai International Academic City, Dubai, Dubai, AE"],"firstName":"Ayush Ashish","lastName":"Shirsat"},{"name":"Jagadish Nayak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Dubai, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Jagadish","lastName":"Nayak","id":"37086329384"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8203915","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Optical transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Integrated optics","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","free-space optical communication","MIMO communication","next generation networks","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible light communication","MIMO channel","data communications","data transfer mechanism","VLC technology","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing modulation technique","next generation communication technology","Multiple Input Multiple Output technique","Lambertian emission pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lambertian emission","Multiple input and multiple output (MIMO)","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","Signal to noise ratio (SNR)","Visible light communication (VLC)"]}],"abstract":"In today's scenario, efficient usage of resources in applications like data communications plays an important role.

In this paper, we consider four different M-ary modulation techniques to optimize the energy consumption cost per successfully received information bit. These digital modulation techniques include linear coherent modulation systems such as MQAM (M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), MPSK (M-ary Phase Shift Keying), MPAM (M-ary Pulse Amplitude Modulation), and non-linear non-coherent modulation system such as MFSK (M-ary Frequency Shift Keying). For this, we employ interior-point optimization method to solve the proposed problem. The formulation is verified by simulation experiments for various uncoded modulation schemes involving AWGN channel. The results obtained from simulation analyses indicate that the proposed optimization scheme converges to energy-efficient solutions within finite number of iterations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08203934.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy optimization in ad-hoc networks with MQAM, MFSK, MPSK and MPAM modulations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Energy consumption","Ad hoc networks","Optimization","Energy efficiency","Wireless communication","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","AWGN channels","error statistics","frequency shift keying","optimisation","phase shift keying","pulse amplitude modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["successfully received information bit","digital modulation techniques","linear coherent modulation systems","MQAM","M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation","MPSK","M-ary Phase Shift Keying","M-ary Pulse Amplitude Modulation","noncoherent modulation system","MFSK","M-ary Frequency Shift Keying","interior-point optimization method","uncoded modulation schemes","energy optimization","MPAM modulations","energy-effective modulation technique","energy-constrained ad-hoc networks","different M-ary modulation techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad-hoc network","Energy optimization","MFSK","MPAM","MPSK","MQAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy optimization in ad-hoc networks with MQAM, MFSK, MPSK and MPAM modulations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203934/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17418519","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy optimization in ad-hoc networks with MQAM, MFSK, MPSK and MPAM modulations","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046431S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8203934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203938,"authors":[{"name":"Poonam Sharma","affiliation":["Computer science and Eng Dept, Amity University, Gurgaon, India"],"firstName":"Poonam","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085479872"},{"name":"Akansha Singh","affiliation":["CSE & It Dept., The NorthCap Universoty, Gurgaon, Haryana"],"firstName":"Akansha","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086323786"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8203938","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1247},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Era of deep neural networks: A review","abstract":"Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various machine learning and computer vision applications.

As many algorithms inspired from the nature have been proposed to evaluate the performance of MIMO system parameters like channel capacity, bit error rate and the best fitness value of channel capacity. But this technique delivers some issues such as increases the cost and complexity of hardware due to increasing number of antennas. To solve this issue, an effective optimal transmit antenna subset selection method is described in this paper with the aid of PSO. For each position of the particle, corresponding fitness function is evaluated and from there global best fitness values are chosen. The implementation of proposed work is done in the working platform MATLAB and the performance of MIMO are evaluated with various selection of transmit antenna subsets. Moreover, Improvement in Channel Capacity and BER with increasing SNR are discussed Hence, with the aid of proposed work, the selection of transmit antenna with the maximum capacity and minimum BER are made and which leads to the reduced hardware complexity and decrease number of antennas in the MIMO system.","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08203962.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm in MIMO systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm in MIMO systems","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17418431","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203962/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm in MIMO systems","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058078S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8203962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203966,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Hence, the SDN permit network administrator to adjust wide traffic flow from centralized control console without having to touch Switches and Routers, and can provide the services to wherever they are needed in the network. As in SDN the control plane is disassociated from underlying forwarding plane, however, susceptible to many security challenges like Denial of Service (DoS) attack, Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack, Volumetric attack. In this paper, we highlight some security challenges and evaluate some security solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203978","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08203978.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security challenges in software defined network and their solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Security challenges in software defined network and their solutions","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8203978/","accessionNumber":"17418494","publicationDate":"July 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security challenges in software defined network and their solutions","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091596S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8203978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8203981,"authors":[{"name":"Umme Aiman","affiliation":["University School of Information and Communication Technology, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Umme","lastName":"Aiman","id":"37086323337"},{"name":"Virendra P.

Training of deep models shows exceptional performance with large datasets, but they are not suitable for learning from few samples. This paper proposes a modified deep learning neural network to learn face representation from a smaller dataset. The proposed network is composed of a set of elaborately designed CNNs, RELUs and fully connected layers. The training dataset is augmented with synthetically generated samples by applying Gaussian and Poisson noise to each sample of the training set, thus doubling the size of the training set. We experimentally demonstrate that the augmented training dataset actually improves the generalization power of CNNs. The network is trained using the standard AT&T face database. Using the proposed approach for limited training data, substantial improvement in recognition rate is achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203981/","accessionNumber":"17428928","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203981/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Face recognition using modified deep learning neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition using modified deep learning neural network","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087034S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8203981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8203985,"authors":[{"name":"Rashmi Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Delhi"],"firstName":"Rashmi","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086314803"},{"name":"Akanksha Juneja","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Delhi"],"firstName":"Akanksha","lastName":"Juneja","id":"37085755928"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8203985","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203985","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Color","Particle swarm optimization","Object recognition","Correlation","Lighting","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image filtering","median filters","object detection","object recognition","object tracking","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shadow identification","constrained particle swarm optimization","computer vision applications","object identification","object tracking","Peripheral Increment Sign Correlation","shadow elimination","L*a*b* components","median filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shadow identification","Particle swarm optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203985","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08203985.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for shadow identification using constrained particle swarm optimization","abstract":"Shadow identification and elimination is the procedure to upgrade the execution, dependability and precision of computer vision applications involving object identification, object tracking, supervision etc. Identification and elimination of shadow from the images and videos can decline the undesirable outcomes in computer vision applications and estimations.

Software-Defined Networks (SDN) seems to be a promising network architecture solution which decouples control and data planes and standardizes their communication via an OpenFlow protocol. Most networking giants have implemented and bought out various versions of OpenFlow Switches with improvised features. But these commercial switches are either too expensive or too closed to perform research work at college campus. In this paper we propose a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based OpenFlow Switch which is highly modular, parameterized and OpenFlow 1.1.0 compliant. This OpenFlow Switch is simulated using Very High Speed Integrated circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) in Xilinx Integrated Synthesis Environment (ISE) and is easily portable to various FPGA platforms and architecturally provides scope to run varieties of experiments to facilitate research.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203995","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08203995.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8203995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8203995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation and testing of openflow switch using FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8203995/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and testing of openflow switch using FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8203995/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17428886","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and testing of openflow switch using FPGA","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05185S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8203995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8203998,"authors":[{"name":"Ekta Rani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Punjabi University, Patiala"],"firstName":"Ekta","lastName":"Rani","id":"37086298652"},{"name":"Harpreet Kaur","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Punjabi University, Patiala"],"firstName":"Harpreet","lastName":"Kaur","id":"37085348891"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8203998","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":518},"abstract":"Cloud computing is an internet-based pool of heterogeneous resources.

The use of Fog computing enhances reliability and availability of the online services due to enhanced heterogeneity and increased number of computing servers. However, security remains an open challenge. Various trust models have been proposed to measure the security strength of available service providers. We utilize the quantized security of Datacenters and propose a new security-based service broker policy(SbSBP) for Fog computing environment to allocate the optimal Datacenter(s) to serve users' requests based on users' requirements of cost, time and security. Further, considering the dynamic nature of Fog computing, the concept of dynamic reconfiguration has been added. Comparative analysis of simulation results shows the effectiveness of proposed policy to incorporate users' requirements in the decision-making process.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th

life activities like health care, monitoring, transportation, smart homes etc. Artificial Intelligence along with Machine learning has played a very supportive role to analyze various situations and take decisions accordingly. Maneuver anticipation supplements existing Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) by anticipating mishaps and giving drivers more opportunity to respond to road circumstances proactively. The capacity to sort the driver conduct is extremely beneficial for advance driver assistance system (ADAS). Deep learning solutions would further be an endeavor of for driving conduct recognition. A technique for distinguishing driver's conduct is imperative to help operative mode transition between the driver and independent vehicles. We propose a novel approach of dissecting driver's conduct by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and a combination of Convolutional Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) that would give better results in less response time. We are likewise proposing to concentrate high level features and interpretable features depicting complex driving examples by trying CNN, RNN and then CNN with LSTM. We could improve the system accuracy to 95% by combining CNN with LSTM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204039/","accessionNumber":"17428899","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8204039/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance of convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network for anticipation of driver's conduct","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network for anticipation of driver's conduct","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073322S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8204039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8204047,"authors":[{"name":"Tamen Thapa Sarkar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Nit Kurukshetra, Kurukshetra, India"],"firstName":"Tamen Thapa","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37086253959"},{"name":"Lillie Dewan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Nit Kurukshetra, Kurukshetra, India"],"firstName":"Lillie","lastName":"Dewan","id":"37369800900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8204047","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Tuning","Observers","Optimization","Time-domain analysis","Control systems","Observability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","genetic algorithms","nonlinear control systems","pendulums","pole assignment","stability","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm optimized PID control","Pole-Placement method","PID based control","time domain specifications","inverted pendulum system","genetic algorithm based stabilization","controller design","real time Quanser kit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverted Pendulum","Pole-placement","PID","Genetic Algorithm","Quanser"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204047","abstract":"This paper presents a comparative study of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimized PID control with the Pole-Placement method and the PID based control in matlab for stabilizing the pendulum in its upright position.

They can be used in a variety of fields ranging from security and authentication services to content based information retrieval and also criminal investigations. Gender detection has started to gain importance because of the fact that recent studies conducted showed that the performance of gender dependent speech recognition models performs much better than gender independent models. In the proposed work, we aim to build such a system involving perceptual audio features such as pitch and tempo based features, short time energy etc., which are used to train classifiers to differentiate between the two classes of gender. We have selected such a combination of features as because previous works focused only on either pitch approach, MFCC approach etc., whereas our work is perhaps one of the first involving a combination of several such perceptual features. The system was tested on a wide range of speech files and was shown to be yielding promising results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of male and female speech using perceptual features","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204065","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08204065.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Classification of male and female speech using perceptual features","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8204065/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17428955","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of male and female speech using perceptual features","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082595S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8204065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8204069,"authors":[{"name":"Debojyoti Seth","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering, Future Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Debojyoti","lastName":"Seth","id":"37086017393"},{"name":"Debashis Chakraborty","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering, Future Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Debashis","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37086025678"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8204069","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Hospitals","Electromyography","Internet of Things","Electroencephalography","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","hospitals","Internet of Things","medical information systems","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HMM-IOT hybrid","current spectral analysis data","hidden Markov model","predictive analysis","dynamic probabilistic nature","Internet of Things","hybrid driven smart hospital","Hospital Information System"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov Models","Internet of Things","Hospital Information System","Smart hospitals","Spectral Analysis"]}],"abstract":"Based on the advancements in pervasive healthcare our perception of healthcare is changing quite fast.

The scheduler orders the tasks according to the steps mentioned under the scheduling algorithms. The scheduling algorithms need to ensure that the cloud is functioning to the optimum efficiency as well as the tasks are given equal weightage. The way of execution of a scheduling algorithm differs from one another and hence a system, if established, to compare these scheduling algorithms will help the cloud service providers to work better and in a more efficient way as per the user requirements. In fact, it is very important to have a standard comparison system amongst the scheduling algorithms, as per now, there is no particular research done to compare and contrast the scheduling algorithm. This paper develops a set of environments and scenarios in order to differentiate the functioning of the scheduling algorithms. The following scheduling algorithms are studied: First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First, Opportunistic Load Balancing, and Generalized Priority Algorithm. They were put to test under the various environment and scenarios and were evaluated based on parameters such as Cost and Makespan. Based on these studies, an intelligent tool was developed which takes in the user preferences, such as the number of jobs, their preference of time metrics and cost metrics and suggests the scheduler about the number of VMs, and the Scheduling algorithm which should be used to accommodate the user requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204070","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08204070.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating cloud computing scheduling algorithms under different environment and scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204070/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating cloud computing scheduling algorithms under different environment and scenarios","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17428888","htmlLink":"/document/8204070/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating cloud computing scheduling algorithms under different environment and scenarios","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04364S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8204070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8204075,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjeev Saxena","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh"],"firstName":"Sanjeev","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37085394771"},{"name":"M.

Deploying energy storage therefore plays a pivotal role in maintaining the reliability and efficient integration of renewable energy sources in the grid. Thus, it is important to optimally schedule the energy storage desired to be connected to the grid so that it would maximize the economic benefits. This paper presents a nonlinear programming approach (NLP) to optimally schedule the daily strategy of operation of the connected energy storage device. To maximize the economic benefits of the hybrid energy system, the energy demand, the market price and operational constraints are considered forming an optimization problem on hourly basis. The optimization problem is solved using NLP approach through General Algebraic Modelling software (GAMS) which is an efficient and fast platform for solution of complex optimization problems. The optimization model is tested with the data of a wind farm and the results showed that the model is effective and gave an optimal solution to the daily operation schedule of the energy storage system while maximizing the revenue.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal scheduling of energy storage system using NLP approach","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204080","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08204080.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal scheduling of energy storage system using NLP approach","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8204080/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17418557","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal scheduling of energy storage system using NLP approach","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059008S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8204080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8204092,"authors":[{"name":"Mukesh Kumar","affiliation":["SLIET, Longowal, Punjab"],"firstName":"Mukesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086320562"},{"name":"Jagpal Singh Ubhi","affiliation":["SLIET, Longowal, Punjab"],"firstName":"Jagpal Singh","lastName":"Ubhi","id":"37550883200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8204092","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":579},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM cells","Layout","Delays","Power dissipation","Transistors","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit layout","low-power electronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static power dissipation","8T SRAM cell","6T SRAM cells","7T SRAM cells","temperature 27.0 degC","size 180.0 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","DRC","LVS","RCX","Delay","Rise time","Fall time","Power dissipation"]}],"abstract":"The high-speed system and shrinkage in technology lead to more complexity with higher power dissipation.

optimized routing for wireless sensor network using elitist genetic algorithm","abstract":"A key challenge in wireless sensor network (WSN) is represented by energy constrained on sensor nodes i.e. sensor nodes have limited available energy. Thus energy must be used in optimized manner during the network operation. Most of routing algorithm use minimum hop distance and minimum transmission energy model. In such case same path is used many times which leads to drainage to energy of sensor nodes falling in routing path. Some time energy of nodes exhausted result in network partition. In this paper effort has made to develop energy optimized routing algorithm for WSN using genetic algorithm and further we tried to develop elitist genetic algorithm for routing. Simulation results show that elitist genetic algorithm based routing extend network lifetime 4% to 11% compared to genetic algorithm approach and 10% to 19% traditional shortest path approach. Elitist GA raised packet delivery ratio 3% to 8% and 5% to 13% compared to genetic algorithm approach and compared to traditional shortest path approach respectively for WSN routing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204110/","accessionNumber":"17418548","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8204110/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy optimized routing for wireless sensor network using elitist genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy optimized routing for wireless sensor network using elitist genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068562S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8204110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8204114,"authors":[{"name":"Arijit Datta","affiliation":["Discipline of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Arijit","lastName":"Datta","id":"37086262014"},{"name":"Vimal Bhatia","affiliation":["Discipline of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Vimal","lastName":"Bhatia","id":"37085366171"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8204114","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Detection algorithms","Complexity theory","Detectors","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["future advanced wireless systems","multiple-input multiple-output systems","near-ML performance hybrid dijkstra and firefly algorithm","bit error rate","dijkstra's shortest path algorithm","large scale MIMO detection","receiver","transmitter","large-MIMO systems","maximum likelihood BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Firefly algorithm","Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm","Multiple-input multiple-output","Zero forcing","Successive Interference Cancellation","QR Decomposition","Maximum likelihood"]}],"abstract":"To meet the ever growing demand of high data rates, employing large number of antennas at the transmitter and receiver is a key feature of future advanced wireless systems. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems can provide high data rates with high spectral efficiency and have opened a new gateway in wireless systems. However, design of an efficient, robust and non-erroneous detection algorithm is a huge challenge in MIMO systems. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm has been proposed for large scale MIMO detection. The proposed algorithm is motivated by the popular firefly algorithm and dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms the conventional zero forcing, minimum mean square error and successive interference cancellation based MIMO detection techniques in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance and achieves near maximum likelihood BER performance. This makes the proposed algorithm an appropriate candidate for reliable detection in large-MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204114","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08204114.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A near-ML performance hybrid dijkstra and firefly algorithm for large MIMO detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A near-ML performance hybrid dijkstra and firefly algorithm for large MIMO detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204114/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17418468","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8204114/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A near-ML performance hybrid dijkstra and firefly algorithm for large MIMO detection","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089581S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8204114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8204115,"authors":[{"name":"Arindam Singha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering"],"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Singha","id":"37887004800"},{"name":"Anjan Kumar Ray","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering"],"firstName":"Anjan Kumar","lastName":"Ray","id":"37654081500"},{"name":"Arun Baran Samaddar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering"],"firstName":"Arun Baran","lastName":"Samaddar","id":"37547180100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8204115","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological neural networks","Robot sensing systems","Mathematical model","Navigation","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","intelligent robots","mobile robots","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ranging sensor","grid cell position","maximum neural activity","minimum target distance","bio-inspired neural network","weight calculation algorithms","autonomous mobile robot","collision free path","starting position","target position","collision-free navigation","intelligent mobile robot","neural dynamics","topologically grid-based map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["autonomous robot","path planning","navigation","bio-inspired neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204115","abstract":"The basic challenge for an autonomous mobile robot is to find a collision free path while navigating from a starting position to a target position.

A topologically grid-based map is utilized in the proposed neural dynamics. With the help of the ranging sensors the robot can sense only limited range of area. The next grid cell position of the robot is achieved by determining the maximum neural activity of its neighbouring neurons or the minimum target distance from the maximum activated neurons. Through simulation we have demonstrated the effectiveness of bio-inspired neural network and compare the effect of two weight calculation algorithms. The robot is successfully reaching to the target with the help of both the weight calculation algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204115","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08204115.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Navigation of mobile robot in a grid-based environment using local and target weighted neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Navigation of mobile robot in a grid-based environment using local and target weighted neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17428913","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8204115/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Navigation of mobile robot in a grid-based environment using local and target weighted neural networks","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105456S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8204115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8204118,"authors":[{"name":"Indresh Kumar Gupta","affiliation":["Dept: Computer Science & Engineering, Shri Shanakaracharya Technical Campus, Bhilai, India"],"firstName":"Indresh Kumar","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086287415"},{"name":"Abha Choubey","affiliation":["Dept: Computer Science & Engineering, Shri Shanakaracharya Technical Campus, Bhilai, India"],"firstName":"Abha","lastName":"Choubey","id":"37721861300"},{"name":"Siddhartha Choubey","affiliation":["Dept: Computer Science & Engineering, Shri Shanakaracharya Technical Campus, Bhilai, India"],"firstName":"Siddhartha","lastName":"Choubey","id":"37716513900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3038-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3039-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8204118","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Wheels","Clustering algorithms","Computer science","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","knapsack problems","pattern clustering","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clustered genetic algorithm","multidimensional knapsack problem","GA","NP-hard problem whose applications","loading problems","modified crossover operators","hierarchical clustering method","CPU running time","fuzzy roulette wheel selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multidimensional knapsack problem","Genetic algorithm","Fitness function","Crossover","Mutation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204118","abstract":"Genetic Algorithm (GA) has emerged as a powerful tool to discover optimal for multidimensional knapsack problem (MDKP).

It offers on-demand computing resources to the user on the rent basis. In this technology pool of computing resources named CPU, RAM, bandwidth, etc., are shared by the number of users. Virtualization is the technology which makes possible to the sharing of physical resources. Cloud is a complete business model. Hence, generating the highest revenue with user satisfaction is the prime objective of the cloud provider. As the cloud is the utility model similar to the electricity bill, so the revenue of the provider mainly depends on the time and the size of the resources which is used by the user. Our approach is also based on this consideration, i.e., time and size of the resources used by the user. This paper proposes a cost based resource allocation approach that will minimize the execution time, total completion time, and increase the profit of the provider along with the user satisfaction by giving the priority according to the cost paid by the user to the service provider for the used resource. This approach migrates the virtual machine from one physical host (physical machine) to another in order to avoid the overloaded and under load situation of the host. This approach is implemented in the CloudSim simulator in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost based resource allocation strategy for the cloud computing environment","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204170","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123903/8203898/08204170.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cost based resource allocation strategy for the cloud computing environment","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8204170/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17428912","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost based resource allocation strategy for the cloud computing environment","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0608S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123903","isNumber":"8203898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123903","xplore-issue":"8203898","articleId":"8204170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8204176,"authors":[{"name":"Shelesh Krishna Saraswat","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, G.L.A.

By applying Fast FIR Algorithm, 65 percent of multipliers are reduced and the number of adders are increased. The adders occupy less silicon area than multipliers. Hence, the reduction in area is achieved by replacing the multipliers with adders. Further, the proposed 16 parallel FFA filter structure reduces the delay when compared to 16 parallel FIR filter structure without applying Fast FIR Algorithm. The proposed filter architecture occupies an area of 79220 sq. \u03bcm and consumes a power of 20mW at 333MHz when synthesized.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on

the frequency conversion of electromyogram (EMG) signals and the image recognition by using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Since EMG signals are generated before finger motion, various EMG-based systems have been developed for smoothly controlling a robot hand. We used a simple CNN model for estimating finger motion by classifying images generated from a wavelet transform of EMG signals. The model has originally been used for document recognition, and it contains two pairs of convolution and pooling layers and two fully connected layers. A prototype system composed of inexpensive sensor devices was fabricated for acquiring EMG signals and capturing finger motion. The experimental results show that the test accuracy reached 83% in classifying EMG signals into four types; when a thumb opens or is closed, and fingers, except for the thumb, open or are closed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430872","htmlLink":"/document/8204206/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Finger motion estimation based on frequency conversion of EMG signals and image recognition using convolutional neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finger motion estimation based on frequency conversion of EMG signals and image recognition using convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"FA16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092129S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167731","isNumber":"8204193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167731","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8204193","articleId":"8204206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8204286,"authors":[{"name":"Jungheon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jungheon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086325323"},{"name":"Youngsan Koh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngsan","lastName":"Koh","id":"37086324292"},{"name":"Jihoon Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jihoon","lastName":"Yang","id":"37064894500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-93215-14-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1025-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8204286","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a video event classification system that classifies video events using the correlation of images and sounds extracted from one video.

Considering the intensity of the stimuli that act upon a driver between these vehicles, the point at which the stimuli resultant becomes zero (i.e. the equilibrium point) is obtained. Consequently, the location of such a point within the leader-follower gap changes continuously according to the speed of the middle vehicle and the current traffic scenario. This methodology enables the systematic computation of speed and position references for automatic ramp merging systems. Such stimuli-induced equilibrium point has shown to improve the performance of existing merging control schemes while increasing safety conditions by providing enough reaction time for drivers to avoid an eventual collision.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8204193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ICCAS.2017.8204340","publicationTitle":"2017 17th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167731/8204193/08204340.pdf","startPage":"825","endPage":"830","doi":"10.23919/ICCAS.2017.8204340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stimuli-induced equilibrium point: A psychological field theory application in ramp merging systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Stimuli-induced equilibrium point: A psychological field theory application in ramp merging systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8204340/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430787","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204340/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stimuli-induced equilibrium point: A psychological field theory application in ramp merging systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TC26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05209S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167731","isNumber":"8204193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167731","xplore-issue":"8204193","articleId":"8204340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":8204413,"authors":[{"name":"Won Jae Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Won Jae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086315833"},{"name":"Dong Sung Pae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Sung","lastName":"Pae","id":"37085696917"},{"name":"Dong Won Kim","affiliation":["Department of Digital Electronics and Information Engineering, Inha Technical College, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Won","lastName":"Kim","id":"38239472600"},{"name":"Myo Taeg Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Myo Taeg","lastName":"Lim","id":"37290661800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-93215-14-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1025-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8204413","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204413","abstract":"Vehicle detection is the most basic and important technology in advanced driver assistant system. Conventional methods do not reflect characteristic information of vehicle images, so they were vulnerable to noise. In order to improve the performance of vehicle detection, this paper proposes a vehicle detection framework using selective multi-stage features in convolutional neural networks. We design the convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 10 layers and use a visualization technique to selectively extract features from the activation feature map in CNN. Our proposed features have the characteristic information of vehicle images and are more robust to noise than traditional appearance based features. We train the Adaboost algorithm using these features to implement a vehicle detector. The result of the experiments proves that our proposed vehicle detection framework has a better performance than other frameworks.","doi":"10.23919/ICCAS.2017.8204413","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167731/8204193/08204413.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 17th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ICCAS.2017.8204413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8204193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vehicle detection using selective multi-stage features in convolutional neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Vehicle detection","Visualization","Detectors","Vehicles","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","road vehicles","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["activation feature map","characteristic information","vehicle images","vehicle detection framework","convolutional neural networks","advanced driver assistant system","convolutional neural network model","appearance based features","CNN model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["advanced driver assistant system","CNN","Adaboost","vehicle detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A vehicle detection using selective multi-stage features in convolutional neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8204413/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430870","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vehicle detection using selective multi-stage features in convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"WA11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040549S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167731","isNumber":"8204193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167731","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8204193","articleId":"8204413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8204417,"authors":[{"name":"Xun Shen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085460732"},{"name":"Tielong Shen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tielong","lastName":"Shen","id":"37277322000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-93215-14-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1025-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8204417","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204417","abstract":"A multiple-step vehicle torque demand forecasting problem is investigated in this paper.

It can detect the sensors failure, pinpoint what sensor fails, and replace the sensor with the other normal sensor.","doi":"10.23919/ICCAS.2017.8204431","startPage":"139","endPage":"144","publicationTitle":"2017 17th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ICCAS.2017.8204431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8204193","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167731/8204193/08204431.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor failure detection, identification and accommodation using neural network and fuzzy voter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204431/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sensor failure detection, identification and accommodation using neural network and fuzzy voter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8204431/","accessionNumber":"17430781","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor failure detection, identification and accommodation using neural network and fuzzy voter","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"WA81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060027S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167731","isNumber":"8204193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167731","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8204193","articleId":"8204431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8204451,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Hwan Son","affiliation":["Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Ji-Hwan","lastName":"Son","id":"37086316139"},{"name":"Sanghyouk Choi","affiliation":["Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sanghyouk","lastName":"Choi","id":"37086267433"},{"name":"Jihun Cha","affiliation":["Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jihun","lastName":"Cha","id":"37086270908"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-93215-14-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1025-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8204451","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cameras","Laser radar","Collision avoidance","Airplanes","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","SUAVs","suitable sensors","avoidance process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sense and Avoid","Detect and Avoid","Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Collision Avoidance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204451","abstract":"This paper briefly presents current status of sensors for detect, sense, and avoid operations of Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs).

At first, the Canny Edge Detector (CED) and the Probabilistic Hough Transformation (PHT) are used to identify the structures based on visual data collected by the onboard camera. Then suitable geometrical parameters are extracted from the collected structure information to design controller mechanism of the UAV for autonomous tracking along the identified linear structure. For autonomous tracking, the development of an appropriate controller is significant because it affects the overall response time, sensitivity, accuracy of the tracking performance by the UAV. Through analyzing the previous research results of pipeline recognition and the UAV navigation by velocity mapping [1], it can be seen that the overall lateral correction of the navigation path based on the conventional PID has obvious disadvantages such as a slow response time, UAV oscillation, angular and lateral instability etc. Especially for a low-altitude tracking, the tracking target is prone to be out of camera view very quickly. Thus a new controller with variant coefficients is designed for a better tracking performance. Combined with the previous research achievement, this paper emphasizes the principal and the allocation of the newly designed variant PID controller.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167731/8204193/08204467.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"372","publicationTitle":"2017 17th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)","doi":"10.23919/ICCAS.2017.8204467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ICCAS.2017.8204467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8204193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variant PID controller design for autonomous visual tracking of oil and gas pipelines via an unmanned aerial vehicle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PI control","PD control","Pipelines","Inspection","Navigation","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","control system synthesis","edge detection","Hough transforms","motion control","navigation","path planning","three-term control","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variant PID controller design","autonomous visual tracking","gas pipelines","unmanned aerial vehicle","improved autonomous navigation control mechanism","linear horizontal structures","visual data","onboard camera","suitable geometrical parameters","collected structure information","controller mechanism","autonomous tracking","identified linear structure","tracking performance","pipeline recognition","UAV navigation","navigation path","conventional PID","slow response time","UAV oscillation","low-altitude tracking","tracking target","newly designed variant PID controller","probabilistic Hough transformation","Canny edge detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV navigation","Visual tracking","Variant PID control","Pipeline inspection","Autonomous tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Variant PID controller design for autonomous visual tracking of oil and gas pipelines via an unmanned aerial vehicle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8204467/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17430701","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variant PID controller design for autonomous visual tracking of oil and gas pipelines via an unmanned aerial vehicle","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"WC23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051185S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8167731","isNumber":"8204193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8167731","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8204193","articleId":"8204467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems -

These proposed methods can lead to the elimination of inter-ONU guard bands, and facilitate overlapping inter-ONU subcarriers, while eliminating the effectsofMAI.Additionally,theperformanceofthesemulticarrier formats was analyzed in the downlink channel at a data rate of 15.6 Gb/s and a transmission span of 50 km where neglible performance penalty was observed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of OFDMA and GFDMA for next-generation pons","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.001064","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8204493/08204497.pdf","startPage":"1064","endPage":"1073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.001064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8204493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of OFDMA and GFDMA for next-generation pons","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17447802","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of OFDMA and GFDMA for next-generation pons","sourcePdf":"1064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070916S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","isNumber":"8204493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8204497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8204499,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Sik Nam","affiliation":["Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Sung Sik","lastName":"Nam"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, SA"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini"},{"name":"Lin Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"8204499","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204499","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical fiber communication","Optical receivers","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","communication complexity","error statistics","free-space optical communication","heterodyne detection","optical signal detection","probability","statistical analysis","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold-based multiple optical signal selection scheme","TMOS","statistical analysis","intensity modulation-direct detection techniques","log-normal turbulence","probability","average bit error rate","adaptive modulation","minimum average bit error rate requirement","average spectral efficiency","heterodyne detection","beam-selection scheme","free-space optical wavelength division multiplexing systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free-space optical communication;Heterodyne detection; Intensity modulation/directdetection; Log-normal turbulence; Wavelength divisionmultiplexing."]}],"doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.001085","endPage":"1096","startPage":"1085","publicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8204493/08204499.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.001085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8204493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold-based multiple optical signal selection scheme for free-space optical wavelength division multiplexing systems","abstract":"We propose a threshold-based multiple optical signal selection scheme (TMOS) for free-space optical wavelength division multiplexing systems.

NG-EPON allows an optical network unit (ONU) transmission to be scheduled on multiple wavelength channels simultaneously. This will increase network capacity up to 100 Gb/s, along with flexibility, as any of the channels can be allocated from the four wavelength channels, each having a capacity of 25 Gb/s. However, it also raises many technical aspects to be considered while deciding on an optimum scheduling strategy for NG-EPON (100G-EPON) architecture. This paper proposes a dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation (DWBA) algorithm for NG-EPON to schedule upstream wavelength channels while providing a low average packet delay and catering frame resequencing problem. An online scheduling framework with gated service grant sizing policy has been demonstrated in this work. The proposed DWBA algorithm's performance is evaluated in comparison with legacy interleaved polling with an adaptive cycle time (modified- IPACT) and recently proposed water-filling algorithm-based DWBA (WF-DBA) algorithms.

However, the deployment of independent SDN controllers for core and metro segments can bring large inefficiencies to this core network reconfiguration based on traffic prediction when traffic flows from metro areas are rerouted to different ingress nodes in the core. In such cases, OD traffic patterns in the core might severely change, thus affecting the quality of the predictive OD models. New traffic model re-estimation usually takes a long time, during which no predictive capabilities are available for the network operator. To alleviate this problem, we propose to extend data analytics to metro networks to obtain predictive models for the metro flows; by knowing how these flows are aggregated into OD pairs in the core, we can also aggregate their predictive models, thus accurately predicting OD traffic and therefore enabling core VNT reconfiguration. To obtain quality metro-flow models, we propose an estimation algorithmthat processes monitored data and returns a predictive model. In addition, a flow controller is proposed for the control architecture to allow metro and core controllers to exchange metro-flow model information. The proposed model aggregation is evaluated through exhaustive simulation, and eventually experimentally assessed together with the flow controller in a testbed connecting premises in CNIT (Pisa, Italy) and UPC (Barcelona, Spain).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Monitoring","Data models","Computational modeling","Adaptation models","Prediction algorithms","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre networks","software defined networking","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication traffic","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic core VNT adaptability","predictive metro-flow traffic models","MPLS-over-optical virtual network topologies","near-future traffic matrices","predictive models","data analytics","monitored origin-destination traffic","independent SDN controllers","metro segments","core network reconfiguration","traffic prediction","traffic flows","metro areas","traffic patterns","predictive OD models","predictive capabilities","network operator","metro networks","metro flows","OD pairs","core VNT reconfiguration","quality metro-flow models","returns a predictive model","flow controller","core controllers","metro-flow model information","model aggregation","traffic model re-estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Predictive traffic modeling; Traffic modelaggregation."]}],"doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.001202","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8204493/08204510.pdf","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8204493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.001202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic core VNT adaptability based on predictive metro-flow traffic models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic core VNT adaptability based on predictive metro-flow traffic models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204510/","volume":"9","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17447810","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic core VNT adaptability based on predictive metro-flow traffic models","sourcePdf":"1202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047725S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","isNumber":"8204493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"11","articleId":"8204510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8204566,"authors":[{"name":"Ramzi Saifan","firstName":"Ramzi","lastName":"Saifan"},{"name":"Iyad Jafar","firstName":"Iyad","lastName":"Jafar"},{"name":"Ghazi Al Sukkar","firstName":"Ghazi","lastName":"Al Sukkar"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8204566","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","throughput","sensing","cooperative sensing","energy efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) is a basic requirement to protect the primary user (PU) from bad interference. However, sensing has two main challenges. Firstly, the CR is required to sense the presence of the PU under very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that prolongs the sensing time. Secondly, some CR nodes may suffer from deep fading and shadowing effects, which may produce false sensing results. Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is supposed to overcome these challenges but at the expense of extra energy consumption due to sensing and reporting the results to the fusion center (FC). This energy is dependent on the sensing time of CR nodes, the selection of the FC and the number of CR sensing nodes. In this paper, we formulate three optimization problems, and we propose three independent heuristic algorithms each of which is capable of solving one of the optimization problems by specifying the FC, the cooperative sensing nodes, the sensing time and detection threshold for the sensing nodes. The optimization objective in these problems is minimizing sensing and reporting energy, minimizing sensing time or maximizing throughput under the assumption of different SNR value between the PU and CR nodes. Simulation results show that our approach achieves better performance than other existing approaches in terms of total sensing time, total sensing energy and achieved throughput.","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxx013","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8204563/08204566.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8204563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxx013","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","startPage":"835","endPage":"849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Algorithms in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Algorithms in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204566/","volume":"60","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Algorithms in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"bxx013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025596S","chronDate":"June  2017","isNumber":"8204563","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","articleId":"8204566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8204571,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Zhang","firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Tao Jing","firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jing"},{"name":"Yan Huo","firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Huo"},{"name":"Kaiwei Jiang","firstName":"Kaiwei","lastName":"Jiang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8204571","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy harvesting","Markov decision process"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Optimization for Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networks with Save-Then-Transmit Protocol","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxx024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8204563","endPage":"924","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8204563/08204571.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxx024","startPage":"911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8204571","abstract":"In this paper, we consider a time-slotted energy harvesting cognitive radio network with the save-then-transmit protocol, in which the secondary user (SU) is powered by energy harvested from the ambient environment. The primary concern of this study is to design an optimal harvesting-access policy to maximize the throughput of the SU, where the harvesting part of the policy specify the time duration allocated for harvesting energy, and the access part of the policy specify the power level to be used upon transmission. Jointly considering the presence of primary users, diversity of channel quality, time and energy consumption for the sensing process as well as sensing errors, we formulate the above design problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process, and propose an algorithm to find the optimal harvesting-access policy using the value iteration. We then investigate the relationship between the throughput, the available energy in the battery and the battery capacity.

Next, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we propose an optimal myopic policy with a closed-form expression.

Nonetheless, executing graph algorithms efficiently and at scale is surprisingly challenging. As a consequence, distributed programming frameworks have emerged to empower large graph processing. Pregel, as a popular computational model for processing billion-vertex graphs, has been employed to improve the scalability of many algorithms. In this paper, we investigate frequent subgraph mining on single large graphs using Pregel. We present the first distributed algorithm based on Pregel for single massive graphs. In addition, two optimizations are proposed to enhance the algorithm, reducing communication cost and distribution overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on real-life data confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm and techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8204590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","volume":"59","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Frequent Subgraph Mining Based on Pregel","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Frequent Subgraph Mining Based on Pregel","sourcePdf":"bxv118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023448S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","isNumber":"8204582","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8204590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8204843,"authors":[{"name":"Yash Deshpande","firstName":"Yash","lastName":"Deshpande"},{"name":"Emmanuel Abbe","firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Abbe"},{"name":"Emmanuel Abbe","firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Abbe"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2049-8764"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2049-8772"}],"articleNumber":"8204843","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stochastic block model","community detection","approximate message passing","mutual information"]}],"abstract":"We develop an information-theoretic view of the stochastic block model, a popular statistical model for the large-scale structure of complex networks.

This low distortion, coupled to the high efficiency of class-D amplifiers, is responsible for the increasing use of these devices in a wide variety of applications.

Efficient cybersecurity operations require information exchanges that go beyond organizational borders. Various industry specifications defining information schemata for such exchanges are thus emerging. These specifications, however, define their own schemata since their objectives and the types of information they deal with differ, and desirable schemata differ depending on the purposes. They need to be organized and orchestrated so that individual organizations can fully exchange information and collaborate with one another. To establish the foundations of such orchestration and facilitate information exchanges, this paper proposes a reference ontology for cybersecurity operational information. The ontology structures cybersecurity information and orchestrates industry specifications. We built it from the standpoint of cybersecurity operations in close collaboration with cybersecurity organizations including security operation centers handling actual cybersecurity operations in the USA, Japan and South Korea. This paper demonstrates its usability by discussing the coverage of industry specifications. It then defines an extensible information structure that collaborates with such specifications by using the ontology and describes a prototype cybersecurity knowledge base we constructed that facilitates cybersecurity information exchanges among various parties. Finally, it discusses the usage scenarios of the ontology and knowledge base in cybersecurity operations.

The main barrier of its applications to real seismic data is heavy computational amount. Numerical modelling methods are involved in both forward modelling and backpropagation of wavefield residuals, which spend most of computational time in FWI. We develop a time\u2013space domain finite-difference (FD) method and adaptive variable-length spatial operator scheme in numerical simulation of viscoacoustic equation and extend them into the viscoacoustic FWI. Compared with conventional FD methods, different operator lengths are adopted for different velocities and quality factors, which can reduce the amount of computation without reducing accuracy. Inversion algorithms also play a significant role in FWI. In conventional single-scale methods, it is likely to converge to local minimums especially when the initial model is far from the real model. To tackle the problem, we introduce the second generation wavelet transform to implement the multiscale FWI. Compared to other multiscale methods, our method has advantages of ease of implementation and better time\u2013frequency local analysis ability. The L2 norm is widely used in FWI and gives invalid model estimates when the data is contaminated with strong non-uniform noises. We apply the L1-norm and the Huber-norm criteria in the time-domain FWI to improve its antinoise ability. Our strategies have been successfully applied in synthetic experiments to both onshore and offshore reflection seismic data. The results of the viscoacoustic Marmousi example indicate that our new FWI scheme consumes smaller computer resources. In addition, the viscoacoustic Overthrust example shows its better convergence and more reasonable velocity and quality factor structures. All these results demonstrate that our method can improve inversion accuracy and computational efficiency of FWI.","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8205754/08205758.pdf","startPage":"948","endPage":"974","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","doi":"10.1093/gji/ggu024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggu024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8205754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8205758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale viscoacoustic waveform inversion with the second generation wavelet transform and adaptive time\u2013space domain finite-difference method","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet transform","Inverse theory","Seismic attenuation","Seismic tomography","Computational seismology","Wave propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8205758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale viscoacoustic waveform inversion with the second generation wavelet transform and adaptive time\u2013space domain finite-difference method","volume":"197","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale viscoacoustic waveform inversion with the second generation wavelet transform and adaptive time\u2013space domain finite-difference method","sourcePdf":"ggu024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030396S","chronDate":"May  2014","isNumber":"8205754","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","articleId":"8205758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8205857,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiping Peng","firstName":"Zhiping","lastName":"Peng"},{"name":"Bo Xu","firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Antonio Marcel Gates","firstName":"Antonio Marcel","lastName":"Gates"},{"name":"Delong Cui","firstName":"Delong","lastName":"Cui"},{"name":"Weiwei Lin","firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Lin"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8205857","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["virtual resource","virtual machine cluster","multi-agent organization","collaborative agent"]}],"abstract":"The present study constructs a multi-agent organizational framework with virtual machine clusters as the unit of granularity based on the results of that previous study.

As a result, the interests of the cloud users and providers cannot be simultaneously ensured.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of a Multi-Agent Organizational Framework with Virtual Machine Clusters as the Unit of Granularity in Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxw042","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8205850/08205857.pdf","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxw042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8205850","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8205857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8205857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Study of a Multi-Agent Organizational Framework with Virtual Machine Clusters as the Unit of Granularity in Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"July 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of a Multi-Agent Organizational Framework with Virtual Machine Clusters as the Unit of Granularity in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"bxw042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038755S","chronDate":"July  2017","isNumber":"8205850","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","articleId":"8205857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8205871,"authors":[{"name":"Lois Orosa","firstName":"Lois","lastName":"Orosa"},{"name":"Javier D.

They use modest hardware at the cost of false positives, but never produce false negatives. Signatures were traditionally used in different distributed and network applications, but in recent years their use has been extended to other fields (for instance, support for manycore/multicore parallel programming, such as data race detection, deterministic replay or transactional memory (TM)). One drawback of signatures is that they have a fixed size, and what is a good signature size for one application, may be not appropriate for another. Recently, we proposed a shared hardware module for managing signatures based on a collection of Bloom filters. It has the characteristic of hosting a variable number of signatures that change their size in runtime to adapt to the demand of the applications. However, the assignment of resources follows a single symmetric policy for all allocations leading to a module with a limited adaptability to the workloads. In this paper, we explore new techniques to allocate signatures in an asymmetric way in this module, with the aim of optimizing the resources and reducing even more the number of false positives. We explore several asymmetric strategies and their efficient hardware implementation, and we show specific examples using TM as a driver application. The results show that these strategies lead to a significant reduction in the number of false positives compared with symmetric policies.","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxw010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8205869","startPage":"1453","endPage":"1469","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8205869/08205871.pdf","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxw010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric Allocation in a Shared Flexible Signature Module for Multicore Processors","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["signatures","Bloom filters","multithreaded applications","multicore architectures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric Allocation in a Shared Flexible Signature Module for Multicore Processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8205871/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","volume":"59","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric Allocation in a Shared Flexible Signature Module for Multicore Processors","sourcePdf":"bxw010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040136S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","isNumber":"8205869","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","articleId":"8205871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8205873,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

The term cognitive radio (CR) is apt for spectrum access. Deployment of a CR network involves spectrum sensing, spectrum exploitation, performance evaluation and optimization at different levels in the network. The importance of ubiquitous wireless access to the Internet has been constantly growing in the last years, a wireless application becomes more and more sophisticated and widely used, the demand for more bandwidth will increase substantially, in order to compete the growing demand, one has to consider new concepts of better way of utilizing the spectral resources. This paper deals with the Comparatative Performance Analysis of Filter Bank Multicarrier Prototype Filter under the effect of Tero, Bellanger and Phydas Filter Coefficients. In this paper, simulation analysis of multirate filter structures is done which reflects the modifications in Prototype Filter design. Multicarrier modulation is the apt choice for good data rate wireless communication. In multicarrier communication, the perfect reconstruction is the prime requirement for all structures with alias cancellation at Different \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$K$</tex>\n (Overlapping factor) values when \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$L_{{\\mathrm p}}=K\\times M-1-D$</tex>\n, \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$M=N$</tex>\n, \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N$</tex>\n being number of subcarriers and \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$L_{{\\mathrm p}}$</tex>\n being prototype filter length, \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$D$</tex>\n being delay.

We present a new deep learning model: We extend the state-of-the-art convolutional object detection network for the representation/estimation of human hands in training videos, and newly introduce the concept of using a fully convolutional network to regress (i.e., predict) the intermediate scene representation corresponding to the future frame (e.g., 1-2 seconds later). Combining these allows direct prediction of future locations of human hands and objects, which enables the robot to infer the motor control plan using our manipulation network.

In this paper, we propose an approach for directly regressing a 6-DoF camera pose using CNNs and a single monocular RGB image. We leverage the idea of transfer learning for training our network as this technique has shown to perform better when the number of training samples are not very high. Furthermore, we propose novel data augmentation in 3D space for additional pose coverage which leads to more accurate localization. In contrast to the traditional visual metric localization approaches, our resulting map size is constant with respect to the database. During localization, our approach has a constant time complexity of O(1) and is independent of the database size and runs in real-time at ~80 Hz using a single GPU. We show the localization accuracy of our approach on publicly available datasets and that it outperforms CNN-based state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8205957","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08205957.pdf","startPage":"1525","endPage":"1530","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8205957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep regression for monocular camera-based 6-DoF global localization in outdoor environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8205957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep regression for monocular camera-based 6-DoF global localization in outdoor environments","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17418328","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8205957/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep regression for monocular camera-based 6-DoF global localization in outdoor environments","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090422S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8205957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":8205958,"authors":[{"name":"Naman Patel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, USA"],"firstName":"Naman","lastName":"Patel","id":"37086214889"},{"name":"Anna Choromanska","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, USA"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Choromanska","id":"37086309990"},{"name":"Prashanth Krishnamurthy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, USA"],"firstName":"Prashanth","lastName":"Krishnamurthy","id":"37266317400"},{"name":"Farshad Khorrami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, USA"],"firstName":"Farshad","lastName":"Khorrami","id":"37283001400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8205958","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":866},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor modality fusion with CNNs for UGV autonomous driving in indoor environments","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08205958.pdf","startPage":"1531","endPage":"1536","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8205958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8205958","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Cameras","Convolution","Training","Machine learning","Land vehicles","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","neural nets","optical radar","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimodal fused system","environment geometry","sensor modality fusion","CNNs","UGV autonomous driving","end-to-end learning framework","ground vehicles","cameras","depth measurements","deep neural network architecture","steering commands","sensor failures","indoor corridor environment","comprehensive experimental evaluation","deep learning neural network","LiDAR modalities"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8205958","abstract":"We present a novel end-to-end learning framework to enable ground vehicles to autonomously navigate unknown environments by fusing raw pixels from cameras and depth measurements from a LiDAR.

Its performance is a function of the dynamic coupling between the environment and the robot's impedance controller: inertia, stiffness and damping. An interaction task may be considered successfully accomplished when the elected performance criteria, such as rise time, overshoot and accommodation are achieved, all in addition to guaranteeing stability. The selection and online changes of impedance parameters for such purpose is considered challenging for practical applications, given the non modeled dynamics of the robot and its intrinsic impedance, uncertainties in the dynamics of environment and tool. This study proposes the usage of a multi-objective genetic algorithm to obtain enhanced impedance controller gains, with the purpose of providing impedance control adaptability to a robot in a real physical interaction application. In this context, a one-degree-of-freedom mechanical contact model is proposed to obtain the values of the objective function. A genetic algorithm is used to obtain the best gains, as this is a nonlinear task. Simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed validating the system performance, which has shown a convergence of less than 6 generations. Tendencies to convergence of controller parameters were observed and discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8205972/","accessionNumber":"17418320","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8205972/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adjustable interaction control using genetic algorithm for enhanced coupled dynamics in tool-part contact","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adjustable interaction control using genetic algorithm for enhanced coupled dynamics in tool-part contact","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084262S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8205972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8205986,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Cheng","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38008557800"},{"name":"Lishan Lin","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Lishan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086304128"},{"name":"Zhuoqi Zheng","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Zhuoqi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086299701"},{"name":"Yuwei Guan","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Yuwei","lastName":"Guan","id":"37086298929"},{"name":"Zhongchang Liu","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Zhongchang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37073203100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8205986","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":830},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8205986","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Visualization","Cameras","Streaming media","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Robustness","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","cameras","feedback","mobile robots","object detection","object tracking","remotely operated vehicles","robot vision","target tracking","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous vision","target tracking system","rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicle","maneuvering target","UAV","onboard gimbal camera","target occlusions","real-time tracking","robust tracking scheme","computationally efficient visual tracking scheme","Kernelized Correlation Filter tracker","visual information","estimated states","moving target","onboard TK1 computer","computationally efficient visual tracking scenario"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an autonomous vision-based tracking system is presented to track a maneuvering target for a rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an onboard gimbal camera.

Traditionally, pinch, fingertip grasping and dexterous, in-hand manipulation tasks were executed with fully actuated, rigid robot hands and relied on analytic methods, computation of the hand object Jacobians and extensive numerical simulations for deriving optimal and minimal effort grasps. However, even insignificant uncertainties in the modeling space could render the extraction of candidate grasps or manipulation paths infeasible. Adaptive hands use underactuated mechanisms and structural compliance, facilitating by design the successful extraction of stable grasps and the robust execution of manipulation tasks, even under significant object pose or other environmental uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the automated extraction of dexterous, in-hand manipulation strategies / primitives for adaptive hands. To do so, we use a constrained optimization scheme that describes the kinematics of adaptive hands during the grasping and manipulation processes, an automated experimental setup for data collection, a clustering technique that groups together similar manipulation strategies, and a dimensionality reduction technique that projects the robot kinematics to lower dimensional manifolds. In these manifolds, control is simplified and hand operation becomes more intuitive. In this work, we also assess the effect of the extracted manipulation primitives on the object pose perturbations. The efficiency of the proposed methods is experimentally verified for various adaptive robot hands. The extracted primitives can simplify the operation and control of the open-source robot hand designs of the Yale Open Hand project in dexterous manipulation tasks.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206014","startPage":"1951","endPage":"1958","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206014.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deriving dexterous, in-hand manipulation primitives for adaptive robot hands","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deriving dexterous, in-hand manipulation primitives for adaptive robot hands","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206014/","accessionNumber":"17428253","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206014/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deriving dexterous, in-hand manipulation primitives for adaptive robot hands","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129821S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8206019,"authors":[{"name":"Kiril Solovey","affiliation":["Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Kiril","lastName":"Solovey","id":"37085671184"},{"name":"Dan Halperin","affiliation":["Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Halperin","id":"37355669200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206019","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206019","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Planning","Collision avoidance","Tuning","Computer science","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent systems","multi-robot systems","path planning","sampling methods","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simple yet effective sampling","bottleneck tree","BTT","sampling-based bottleneck pathfinding","cost-map planning technique"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a simple yet effective sampling-based planner that is tailored for bottleneck pathfinding: Given an implicitly-defined cost map M : R\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</sup>\n \u00c5 R, which assigns to every point in space a real value, we wish to find a path connecting two given points, which minimizes the maximal value with respect to M.

This constraint arises in cases where the problem involves the coordination of multiple agents that are restricted to forward motions along predefined paths.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206019","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206019.pdf","startPage":"2003","endPage":"2009","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient sampling-based bottleneck pathfinding over cost maps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient sampling-based bottleneck pathfinding over cost maps","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206019/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428442","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206019/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient sampling-based bottleneck pathfinding over cost maps","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079177S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8206020,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Caccamo","affiliation":["Computer Vision, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Caccamo","id":"37085793846"},{"name":"Ramviyas Parasuraman","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA"],"firstName":"Ramviyas","lastName":"Parasuraman","id":"37085653468"},{"name":"Luigi Freda","affiliation":["ALCOR Laboratory, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Freda","id":"37283188100"},{"name":"Mario Gianni","affiliation":["ALCOR Laboratory, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Gianni","id":"37061116900"},{"name":"Petter \u00d6gren","affiliation":["Computer Vision, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Petter","lastName":"\u00d6gren","id":"37275141600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206020","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Robot sensing systems","Mobile robots","Wireless sensor networks","Planning","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","multi-robot systems","path planning","probability","radiocommunication","service robots","telecommunication network topology","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless connectivity","mobile robot","stable communication","base station","radio signal propagation","unpredictable events","hardware failures","communication loss","disconnected robots","Communication-Aware Motion Planning","robust radio signal mapping method","online radio signal mapping method","resilient communication-aware motion planner","RCAMP","signal mapping framework","connection-safe position","multichannel communication scenarios","autonomous repair","mission risk"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Robots","Self-Repair","Wireless Communication","Communication-Aware Motion Planning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206020","abstract":"Mobile robots, be it autonomous or teleoperated, require stable communication with the base station to exchange valuable information. Given the stochastic elements in radio signal propagation, such as shadowing and fading, and the possibilities of unpredictable events or hardware failures, communication loss often presents a significant mission risk, both in terms of probability and impact, especially in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) operations. Depending on the circumstances, disconnected robots are either abandoned, or attempt to autonomously back-trace their way to the base station. Although recent results in Communication-Aware Motion Planning can be used to effectively manage connectivity with robots, there are no results focusing on autonomously re-establishing the wireless connectivity of a mobile robot without back-tracing or using detailed a priori information of the network. In this paper, we present a robust and online radio signal mapping method using Gaussian Random Fields, and propose a Resilient Communication-Aware Motion Planner (RCAMP) that integrates the above signal mapping framework with a motion planner. RCAMP considers both the environment and the physical constraints of the robot, based on the available sensory information. We also propose a self-repair strategy using RCMAP, that takes both connectivity and the goal position into account when driving to a connection-safe position in the event of a communication loss. We demonstrate the proposed planner in a set of realistic simulations of an exploration task in single or multi-channel communication scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206020","startPage":"2010","endPage":"2017","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206020.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RCAMP: A resilient communication-aware motion planner for mobile robots with autonomous repair of wireless connectivity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"RCAMP: A resilient communication-aware motion planner for mobile robots with autonomous repair of wireless connectivity","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206020/","accessionNumber":"17428216","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206020/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RCAMP: A resilient communication-aware motion planner for mobile robots with autonomous repair of wireless connectivity","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067549S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8206046,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ghadirzadeh","affiliation":["CSC, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghadirzadeh","id":"37085340524"},{"name":"Atsuto Maki","affiliation":["CSC, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Atsuto","lastName":"Maki","id":"37282585300"},{"name":"Danica Kragic","affiliation":["CSC, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Danica","lastName":"Kragic","id":"37281296000"},{"name":"M\u00e5rten Bj\u00f6rkman","affiliation":["CSC, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"M\u00e5rten","lastName":"Bj\u00f6rkman","id":"37283063600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206046","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":937},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206046","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Trajectory","Training","Manifolds","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skilled robot task learning","predictive action policies","motor activations","data-efficient deep predictive policy training framework","deep neural network policy architecture","behavior super-layers","visual motor data","learning framework","policy search reinforcement learning","policy super-layer","simulated training samples","synthetic training samples"]}],"abstract":"Skilled robot task learning is best implemented by predictive action policies due to the inherent latency of sensorimotor processes. However, training such predictive policies is challenging as it involves finding a trajectory of motor activations for the full duration of the action. We propose a data-efficient deep predictive policy training (DPPT) framework with a deep neural network policy architecture which maps an image observation to a sequence of motor activations. The architecture consists of three sub-networks referred to as the perception, policy and behavior super-layers. The perception and behavior super-layers force an abstraction of visual and motor data trained with synthetic and simulated training samples, respectively. The policy super-layer is a small subnetwork with fewer parameters that maps data in-between the abstracted manifolds. It is trained for each task using methods for policy search reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the suitability of the proposed architecture and learning framework by training predictive policies for skilled object grasping and ball throwing on a PR2 robot. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by the fact that these tasks are trained using only about 180 real robot attempts with qualitative terminal rewards.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206046","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206046.pdf","startPage":"2351","endPage":"2358","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep predictive policy training using reinforcement learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep predictive policy training using reinforcement learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206046/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428764","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206046/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep predictive policy training using reinforcement learning","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070976S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8206049,"authors":[{"name":"Jingwei Zhang","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Institute of Computer Science, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jingwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086287434"},{"name":"Jost Tobias Springenberg","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Institute of Computer Science, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jost Tobias","lastName":"Springenberg","id":"38252355500"},{"name":"Joschka Boedecker","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Institute of Computer Science, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Joschka","lastName":"Boedecker","id":"37888921900"},{"name":"Wolfram Burgard","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Institute of Computer Science, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfram","lastName":"Burgard","id":"37270485300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206049","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Neural networks","Simultaneous localization and mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task instance","deep reinforcement learning algorithm","successor-feature","navigation task","onboard sensors","simple maze-like","robot navigation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206049","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206049.pdf","startPage":"2371","endPage":"2378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep reinforcement learning with successor features for navigation across similar environments","abstract":"In this paper we consider the problem of robot navigation in simple maze-like environments where the robot has to rely on its onboard sensors to perform the navigation task.

Additionally, we require that our solution can quickly adapt to new situations (e.g., changing navigation goals and environments). To meet these criteria we frame this problem as a sequence of related reinforcement learning tasks. We propose a successor-feature-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can learn to transfer knowledge from previously mastered navigation tasks to new problem instances. Our algorithm substantially decreases the required learning time after the first task instance has been solved, which makes it easily adaptable to changing environments. We validate our method in both simulated and real robot experiments with a Robotino and compare it to a set of baseline methods including classical planning-based navigation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206049/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428292","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deep reinforcement learning with successor features for navigation across similar environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep reinforcement learning with successor features for navigation across similar environments","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113069S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8206051,"authors":[{"name":"Terry Taewoong Um","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Terry Taewoong","lastName":"Um","id":"37086289629"},{"name":"Vahid Babakeshizadeh","affiliation":["Push Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Babakeshizadeh","id":"37086293653"},{"name":"Dana Kuli\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Dana","lastName":"Kuli\u0107","id":"37547876700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206051","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":863},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exercise motion classification from large-scale wearable sensor data using convolutional neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206051","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wearable sensors","Training","Feature extraction","Computer architecture","Convolution","Two dimensional displays","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","body sensor networks","convolution","image classification","image motion analysis","image sensors","neural nets","sport","time series","wearable computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exercise motion classification","large-scale wearable sensor data","convolutional neural network","human activities","automatic rehabilitation","sports training systems","large-scale exercise motion data","time-series data","accelerometer","orientation measurements","image formatting","CNN architectures"]}],"abstract":"The ability to accurately identify human activities is essential for developing automatic rehabilitation and sports training systems.

A mapping from visual features extracted from a convolutional neural network (CNN) to grasp points is learned. We demonstrate that a CNN pre-trained for image classification can be applied to a grasping task based on a small set of grasping examples. Our approach takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of the CNN by identifying features that capture the hierarchical support relations between filters in different CNN layers and locating their 3D positions by tracing activations backwards in the CNN. When this backward trace terminates in the RGB-D image, important manipulable structures are thereby localized. These features that reside in different layers of the CNN are then associated with controllers that engage different kinematic subchains in the hand/arm system for grasping. A grasping dataset is collected using demonstrated hand/object relationships for Robonaut-2 to evaluate the proposed approach in terms of the precision of the resulting preshape postures.

This paper builds upon our previous work, and addresses the problem of how to combine 3D distance information from the map and the current visual image from the robot's camera in order to navigate within this map. The underlying assumption is that features which cause depth changes are also likely to create visual gradients. Based on this assumption, the similarity of visual image and depth images that are synthesized from the 3D map can be used to evaluate pose hypothesis. This paper integrates this idea into a Monte Carlo localization approach and additionally presents its application to path following. The presented approach is evaluated on a synthetic datasets that provides perfect knowledge of the ground truth, as well as two real-world datasets acquired by a heterogeneous robotic team: a proof-of-concept dataset in a scattered indoor environment, and a challenging corridor dataset.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206067","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206067.pdf","startPage":"2492","endPage":"2498","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-based methods for visual navigation in 3D maps by synthesizing depth images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-based methods for visual navigation in 3D maps by synthesizing depth images","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206067/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428573","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206067/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-based methods for visual navigation in 3D maps by synthesizing depth images","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046867S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8206084,"authors":[{"name":"Gowtham Garimella","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Gowtham","lastName":"Garimella","id":"37085551133"},{"name":"Joseph Funke","affiliation":["Zoox Inc., Menlo Park, California, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Funke","id":"37086309727"},{"name":"Chuang Wang","affiliation":["Zoox Inc., Menlo Park, California, USA"],"firstName":"Chuang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086308968"},{"name":"Marin Kobilarov","affiliation":["Zoox Inc., Menlo Park, California, USA","Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Marin","lastName":"Kobilarov","id":"37546944400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206084","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":790},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206084","abstract":"Model-based control of dynamical systems typically requires accurate domain-specific knowledge and specifications of possibly proprietary system components. In the context of autonomous driving, steering actuator dynamics can be difficult to model due to an integrated proprietary power steering control module. While first-principles models derived from physics laws can often approximate the system behavior, it remains generally difficult to capture non-physically derived behavior based on proprietary software algorithms in the power steering system. To overcome this limitation, this work instead employs a recurring neural network to model the steering dynamics of an autonomous vehicle. The resulting model is then integrated into a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control scheme to generate feedforward steering commands for embedded control. The proposed approach is compared to traditional first-principles steering modeling through on-vehicle experiments and statistical data validation. As a result, it is shown that the neural network model can be automatically generated with less domain-specific knowledge, can predict steering dynamics more accurately, and perform comparably to a high-fidelity first principles model when used for controlling the steering system of a self-driving vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206084","startPage":"2609","endPage":"2615","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206084.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network modeling for steering control of an autonomous vehicle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Vehicle dynamics","Neural networks","Predictive models","Feedforward systems","Power steering","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","feedforward","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","position control","predictive control","steering systems","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network modeling","autonomous vehicle","dynamical systems","autonomous driving","steering actuator dynamics","integrated proprietary power steering control module","first-principles models","physics laws","system behavior","proprietary software algorithms","power steering system","recurring neural network","steering dynamics","resulting model","feedforward steering commands","embedded control","on-vehicle experiments","neural network model","high-fidelity first principles model","self-driving vehicle","domain-specific knowledge","nonlinear model predictive control scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Neural network modeling for steering control of an autonomous vehicle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206084/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428156","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network modeling for steering control of an autonomous vehicle","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07535S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8206110,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Clegg","affiliation":["School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Clegg","id":"37086117058"},{"name":"Wenhao Yu","affiliation":["School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenhao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085891022"},{"name":"Zackory Erickson","affiliation":["Healthcare Robotics Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Zackory","lastName":"Erickson","id":"37085785366"},{"name":"Jie Tan","affiliation":["Google Brain, Google, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Tan","id":"37086455820"},{"name":"C.

The main challenge of such a controller is to avoid getting tangled in, tearing or punching through the deforming cloth. Our controller aggregates force information from a number of haptic-sensing spheres all along the manipulator for guidance. Based on haptic forces, each individual sphere updates its target location, and the conflicts that arise between this set of desired positions is resolved by solving an inverse kinematic problem with constraints. Reinforcement learning is used to train the controller for a single haptic-sensing sphere, where a training run is terminated (and thus penalized) when large forces are detected due to contact between the sphere and a simplified model of the cloth. In simulation, we demonstrate successful navigation of a robotic arm through a variety of garments, including an isolated sleeve, a jacket, a shirt, and shorts. Our controller out-performs two baseline controllers: one without haptics and another that was trained based on large forces between the sphere and cloth, but without early termination.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206110","startPage":"2799","endPage":"2805","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206110.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to navigate cloth using haptics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning to navigate cloth using haptics","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206110/","accessionNumber":"17428263","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206110/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to navigate cloth using haptics","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107443S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":8206116,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Lehner","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Lehner","id":"37085411568"},{"name":"Alin Albu-Sch\u00e4ffer","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Albu-Sch\u00e4ffer","id":"38270361100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206116","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206116","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Gaussian mixture model","Service robots","Manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","manipulators","path planning","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["repetition sampling","similar constrained manipulation tasks","uniform sampling","sampling based planner","Gaussian mixture models"]}],"abstract":"We present repetition sampling, a new adaptive strategy for sampling based planning, which extracts information from previous solutions to focus the search for a similar task on relevant configuration space.

Following this trend, we explore how the concept of search effort can be exploited to find plans quickly. Most previous work in motion planning attempts to find plans quickly by preferring states with low cost-to-go. Recent work in graph search suggests that following search effort-to-go estimates can yield faster planning. In this paper, we demonstrate how this idea can be adapted to the context of kinodynamic motion planning. Our planner, BEAST, uses estimates of effort that are learned on-line to guide the expansion of a motion tree toward states through which a plan is estimated to be easy to find. We present results with four different simulated vehicles (car, hovercraft, blimp and quadrotor) in six different environments indicating that BEAST is able to find solutions much more quickly and has a higher success rate than previous methods. We see this work as further strengthening the algorithmic connections between motion planning and heuristic graph search.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206118","startPage":"2864","endPage":"2871","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206118.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effort bias for sampling-based motion planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An effort bias for sampling-based motion planning","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206118/","accessionNumber":"17428351","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206118/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effort bias for sampling-based motion planning","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063796S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8206125,"authors":[{"name":"Lukas Lindenroth","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College London, UK"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Lindenroth","id":"37085842056"},{"name":"Christian Duriez","affiliation":["Defrost Team, INRIA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Duriez","id":"37428704500"},{"name":"Junghwan Back","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College London, UK"],"firstName":"Junghwan","lastName":"Back","id":"37085427511"},{"name":"Kawal Rhode","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, King's College London, UK"],"firstName":"Kawal","lastName":"Rhode","id":"37294454000"},{"name":"Hongbin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College London, UK"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537718900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206125","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Force","Finite element analysis","Pneumatic systems","Manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","feedback","finite element analysis","force control","force sensors","hydraulic actuators","manipulators","medical robotics","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["device controllability","continuum manipulator","nonlinear finite element model","tip angles","minimally-invasive robotic surgery","force control","tip orientation","tip deflection angles","shear force estimation","normal force estimation","robot tip","shear forces","normal forces","inflatable actuation chambers","hydrostatic pressure feedback","patient safety","endoluminal robotic surgery","compliant robotic manipulators","externally applied forces","hydraulic actuation","compliant robots","intrinsic force sensing capabilities"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206125","abstract":"Knowledge of externally applied forces is crucial for compliant robotic manipulators in minimally-invasive and endoluminal robotic surgery for both patient safety and controllability of the device.

Ex-vivo experiments performed on a moving abdominal phantom demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of this methodology to compute the strain information of a tissue in motion.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206128.pdf","startPage":"2941","endPage":"2946","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strain estimation of moving tissue based on automatic motion compensation by ultrasound visual servoing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Probes","Strain","Visual servoing","Motion estimation","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomechanics","biomedical ultrasonics","deformation","elasticity","force control","medical image processing","medical robotics","motion compensation","motion estimation","phantoms","visual servoing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["abdominal phantom","robotic arm","2D ultrasound probe","robot-assisted system","nonrigid motion estimation","elastic information","ultrasound visual servoing","automatic motion compensation","strain estimation","strain information","strain map","force control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Strain estimation of moving tissue based on automatic motion compensation by ultrasound visual servoing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206128/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17418260","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strain estimation of moving tissue based on automatic motion compensation by ultrasound visual servoing","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054171S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8206137,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This works well for many tasks; however, some tasks like precise tight-fitting insertions can be hard to recreate through exact position replays because they also involve forces and are highly affected by the robot's repeatability and the position of the object in the hand. As of yet there is no way to automatically detect when procedures to reduce position uncertainty should be used. In this paper, we present a new way to automatically detect insertion tasks during impedance control-based trajectory teaching. This is accomplished by recording the forces and torques applied by the operator and inputting these signals to a convolutional neural network. The convolutional neural network is used to extract important features of the spatio-temporal forces and torque signals for distinguishing insertion tasks. Eventually, this method could help robots understand the tasks they are taught at a higher level. They will not only be capable of a position-time replay of the task, but will also recognize the best strategy to apply in order to accomplish the task (in this case insertion). Our method was tested on data obtained from 886 experiments that were conducted on eight different in-hand objects. Results show that we can distinguish insertion tasks from pick-and-place tasks with an average accuracy of 82%.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206154.pdf","startPage":"3210","endPage":"3216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206154","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting insertion tasks using convolutional neural networks during robot teaching-by-demonstration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detecting insertion tasks using convolutional neural networks during robot teaching-by-demonstration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206154/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206154/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428760","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting insertion tasks using convolutional neural networks during robot teaching-by-demonstration","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073061S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8206161,"authors":[{"name":"Mabel M.

This paper describes presentation and demonstration of a sensor and a method for LIDAR-image based localization. Our small LIDAR, named SPAD LIDAR, uses a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD). The SPAD LIDAR incorporates laser receiver and environmental light receiver in a single chip. Therefore, the sensor simultaneously outputs range data and monocular image data. By virtue of this structure, the sensor requires no external calibration between range data and monocular image data. Based on this sensor, we introduce a localization method using a deep convolutional neural network (SPAD DCNN), which fuses SPAD LIDAR outputs: range data, monocular image data, and peak intensity data. Our method regresses LIDAR's position in an environment. We also introduce improved SPAD DCNN, designated as Fast SPAD DCNN. To reduce the computational demands of SPAD DCNN, Fast SPAD DCNN integrates range data and peak intensity data. The integrated data reduces runtime without greatly increasing localization error compared to the conventional method. We evaluate our SPAD DCNN and Fast SPAD DCNN localization method in indoor environments and compare its performance. Results show that SPAD DCNN and Fast SPAD DCNN improve localization in terms of accuracy and runtime.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPAD DCNN: Localization with small imaging LIDAR and DCNN","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206167","startPage":"3312","endPage":"3317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206167.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"SPAD DCNN: Localization with small imaging LIDAR and DCNN","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206167/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428223","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPAD DCNN: Localization with small imaging LIDAR and DCNN","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069057S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8206190,"authors":[{"name":"Ratnesh Madaan","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Ratnesh","lastName":"Madaan","id":"37086298161"},{"name":"Daniel Maturana","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Maturana","id":"37540464600"},{"name":"Sebastian Scherer","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Scherer","id":"37584159000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206190","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wires","Image edge detection","Videos","Real-time systems","Data models","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","computer vision","edge detection","image recognition","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","ray tracing","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic wires","synthetic dataset","synthetic data","grid search","wire detection","unmanned aerial vehicles","autonomous aerial vehicles","convolutional neural networks","line detection","edge detection","convolutional networks","temperature 67.0 K","frequency 3.0 Hz"]}],"abstract":"Wire detection is a key capability for safe navigation of autonomous aerial vehicles and is a challenging problem as wires are generally only a few pixels wide, can appear at any orientation and location, and are hard to distinguish from other similar looking lines and edges. We leverage the recent advances in deep learning by treating wire detection as a semantic segmentation task, and investigate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks for the same. To find an optimal model in terms of detection accuracy and real time performance on a portable GPU, we perform a grid search over a finite space of architectures. Further, to combat the issue of unavailability of a large public dataset with annotations, we render synthetic wires using a ray tracing engine, and overlay them on 67K images from flight videos available on the internet. We use this synthetic dataset for pretraining our models before finetuning on real data, and show that synthetic data alone can lead to pretty accurate detections qualitatively as well. We also verify if providing explicit information about local evidence of wiry-ness in the form of edge and line detection results from a traditional computer vision method, as additional channels to the network input, makes the task easier or not. We evaluate our best models from the grid search on a publicly available dataset and show that they outperform previous work using traditional computer vision and various deep net baselines of FCNs, SegNet and E-Net, on both standard edge detection metrics and inference speed.

environments. In this paper, we learn a manipulation model to execute tasks with multiple stages and variable structure, which typically are not suitable for most robot manipulation approaches. The model is learned from human demonstration using a tactile glove that measures both hand pose and contact forces. The tactile glove enables observation of visually latent changes in the scene, specifically the forces imposed to unlock the child-safety mechanisms of medicine bottles. From these observations, we learn an action planner through both a top-down stochastic grammar model (And-Or graph) to represent the compositional nature of the task sequence and a bottom-up discriminative model from the observed poses and forces. These two terms are combined during planning to select the next optimal action. We present a method for transferring this human-specific knowledge onto a robot platform and demonstrate that the robot can perform successful manipulations of unseen objects with similar task structure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206196/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428273","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Feeling the force: Integrating force and pose for fluent discovery through imitation learning to open medicine bottles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feeling the force: Integrating force and pose for fluent discovery through imitation learning to open medicine bottles","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100513S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":8206197,"authors":[{"name":"Yangming Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Yangming","lastName":"Li","id":"37086145026"},{"name":"Shuai Li","affiliation":["Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Li","id":"37086085139"},{"name":"David Caballero","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Caballero","id":"37089043745"},{"name":"Muneaki Miyasaka","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Muneaki","lastName":"Miyasaka","id":"37085670481"},{"name":"Andrew Lewis","affiliation":["Applied Dexterity Inc., Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Lewis","id":"37085431392"},{"name":"Blake Hannaford","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering, Bioengineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Blake","lastName":"Hannaford","id":"37272234100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206197","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":432},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical robotics","Recurrent neural networks","Kinematics","Surgery","Manipulators","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","manipulators","medical robotics","motion control","neurocontrollers","recurrent neural nets","robust control","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion adaptiveness","recurrent neural network","surgical robot research","robot motion","RNN structure","Raven II surgical robot","surgical safety","control precision","robustness","movement smoothness","manipulator links","adaptiveness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kinematic Control","Bioinspired Controller","Surgical Robot","Recurrent Neural Network","Surgical Safety"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206197","abstract":"Surgical robot research is driven by the desire of improving surgical outcomes.

Many recent studies on robotic dressing assistance usually view dressing as a trajectory planning problem. However, the user movements during the dressing process are rarely taken into account, which often leads to the failures of the planned trajectory and may put the user at risk. The main difficulty of taking user movements into account is caused by severe occlusions created by the robot, the user, and the clothes during the dressing process, which prevent vision sensors from accurately detecting the postures of the user in real time. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing an approach that allows the robot to automatically adapt its motion according to the force applied on the robot's gripper caused by user movements. There are two main contributions introduced in this paper: 1) the use of a hierarchical multi-task control strategy to automatically adapt the robot motion and minimize the force applied between the user and the robot caused by user movements; 2) the online update of the dressing trajectory based on the user movement limitations modeled with the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model in a latent space, and the density information extracted from such latent space. The combination of these two contributions leads to a personalized dressing assistance that can cope with unpredicted user movements during the dressing while constantly minimizing the force that the robot may apply on the user. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method allows the Baxter humanoid robot to provide personalized dressing assistance for human users with simulated upper-body impairments.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206206","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206206.pdf","startPage":"3603","endPage":"3610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personalized robot-assisted dressing using user modeling in latent spaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Personalized robot-assisted dressing using user modeling in latent spaces","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17428247","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206206/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206206/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalized robot-assisted dressing using user modeling in latent spaces","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078989S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8206214,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086045143"},{"name":"Yi Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086281245"},{"name":"Shaojie Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shaojie","lastName":"Shen","id":"37954847200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206214","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2417},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","State estimation","Safety","Navigation","Trajectory optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace safety","autonomous aerial vehicles","collision avoidance","helicopters","mobile robots","optimisation","path planning","robot vision","state estimation","stereo image processing","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["safe trajectory generation","quadrotor flight","complex environments","trajectory generation framework","quadrotor autonomous navigation","gradient information","trajectory generation problem","front-end path","back-end trajectory refinement","informed path searching method","safe path","line segments","initial safe trajectory","dynamical feasibility","smooth trajectories","dynamical feasible trajectories","dense mapping","motion planning module","customized light-weight quadrotor platform","fully autonomous navigation","unknown cluttered indoor","outdoor environments","gradient-based online safe trajectory generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient-based online safe trajectory generation for quadrotor flight in complex environments","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206214","startPage":"3681","endPage":"3688","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206214.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206214","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a trajectory generation framework for quadrotor autonomous navigation in unknown 3-D complex environments using gradient information.

We present an incremental sampling-based algorithm that synthesizes a motion control policy satisfying a bounded Signal Temporal Logic formula over properties of a given environment. Our key insight is that we can bias the selection of samples using a quantitative measure of how well the best path in the current tree of samples satisfies the specification. This allows us both to converge to a path that satisfies the specification, and to improve upon an existing path, i.e. to satisfy the specification with maximum robustness.

One approach is to use a small dataset collected by human experts: however, high capacity learning algorithms tend to overfit when trained with little data. An alternative is to use simulation. But the gap between simulation and real world remains large especially for perception problems. The reason most research avoids using large-scale real data is the fear of crashes! In this paper, we propose to bite the bullet and collect a dataset of crashes itself! We build a drone whose sole purpose is to crash into objects: it samples naive trajectories and crashes into random objects. We crash our drone 11,500 times to create one of the biggest UAV crash dataset. This dataset captures the different ways in which a UAV can crash. We use all this negative flying data in conjunction with positive data sampled from the same trajectories to learn a simple yet powerful policy for UAV navigation. We show that this simple self-supervised model is quite effective in navigating the UAV even in extremely cluttered environments with dynamic obstacles including humans.

There are two strategies developed to leverage the capability of convolution neural network (CNN) in mining the fundamental and generic features for recognition. First, the early layers of CNN should serve the function to extract feature without specific representation. By applying the concept of transfer learning, the first few layers from the pre-learned VGG model can be used directly without further fine-tuning. To alleviate the computational loading and to increase the accuracy of our partially transferred model, a cross-layer inheriting feature fusion (CLIFF) is proposed by using the information from the early layer in fully connected layer without further processing. The experimental result shows that combination of partial transferred model and CLIFF can provide better performance than VGG16 [1] model with re-trained FC layer and other hand-crafted features like RBPs [2].","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206273","startPage":"4139","endPage":"4143","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206273.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partially transferred convolution neural network with cross-layer inheriting for posture recognition from top-view depth camera","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Convolution","Training","Cameras","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution neural network","top-view depth camera","human posture recognition","top-view depth maps","CNN","specific representation","transfer learning","VGG model","partially transferred model","cross-layer inheriting feature fusion","fully connected layer","partial transferred model","VGG16 [1] model","re-trained FC layer","partially transferred convolution neural network","feature extraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Partially transferred convolution neural network with cross-layer inheriting for posture recognition from top-view depth camera","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206273/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428232","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partially transferred convolution neural network with cross-layer inheriting for posture recognition from top-view depth camera","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078763S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8206281,"authors":[{"name":"Thibaut Paschal","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thibaut","lastName":"Paschal","id":"37086306843"},{"name":"Jun Shintake","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shintake","id":"37590896900"},{"name":"Stefano Mintchev","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Mintchev","id":"37085587624"},{"name":"Dario Floreano","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Floreano","id":"37282168700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206281","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":496},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Morphology","Robots","Unmanned underwater vehicles","Servomotors","Prototypes","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","marine control","mobile robots","motion control","servomotors","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater vehicles","swimming modes","adaptive morphology","re-configurable bio-inspired underwater robot","waterproof servomotors","swimming efficiency","fish-mode","octopus-mode","size 50.0 cm","mass 2.1 kg"]}],"abstract":"Bio-inspired underwater robots have several benefits compared to traditional underwater vehicles such as agility, efficiency, and environmentally friendly body. However, bio-inspired underwater robots developed so far have a single swimming mode, which may limit their capability to perform different tasks. This paper presents a re-configurable bio-inspired underwater robot that can change the morphology to enable multiple swimming modes: octopus-mode and fish-mode. The robot is 60 cm long and 50 cm wide, weighing 2.1 kg, and consists of a re-configurable body and 8 compliant arms that are actuated independently by waterproof servomotors. In the robot, the octopus-mode is expected to perform unique tasks such as object manipulation and ground locomotion as demonstrated in literature, while the fish-mode is promising to swim faster and efficiently to travel long distance. With this platform, we investigate the effectiveness of adaptive morphology in bio-inspired underwater robots. For this purpose, we evaluated the robot in terms of the cost of transport and the swimming efficiency of both the morphologies. The fish-mode exhibited a lower cost of transport of 2.2 and higher efficiency of 1.2 % compared to the octopus-mode, illustrating the effect of the multiple swimming modes by adaptive morphology.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206281","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206281.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","startPage":"4197","endPage":"4202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of bio-inspired underwater robot with adaptive morphology capable of multiple swimming modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of bio-inspired underwater robot with adaptive morphology capable of multiple swimming modes","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206281/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428269","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206281/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of bio-inspired underwater robot with adaptive morphology capable of multiple swimming modes","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076398S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8206285,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolai Smolyanskiy","affiliation":["NVIDIA Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Nikolai","lastName":"Smolyanskiy","id":"37086317225"},{"name":"Alexey Kamenev","affiliation":["NVIDIA Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Kamenev","id":"37086318151"},{"name":"Jeffrey Smith","affiliation":["NVIDIA Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Smith","id":"37086317886"},{"name":"Stan Birchfield","affiliation":["NVIDIA Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Stan","lastName":"Birchfield","id":"37371627300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206285","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Navigation","Training","Robots","State estimation","Neural networks","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","collision avoidance","entropy","mobile robots","neural nets","object detection","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-flying autonomous MAV trail navigation","Jetson TX1","label smoothing","entropy reward","outdoor environments","unstructured environments","off-the-shelf hardware","microaerial vehicle system","autonomous flights","forest trails","vision systems","low-level obstacle detection","environmental awareness","vision modules","TrailNet DNN","loss function","overconfident behavior","stable flight","trail center","view orientation","deep neural network"]}],"abstract":"We present a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) system, built with inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware, for autonomously following trails in unstructured, outdoor environments such as forests.

Such approaches suffer from local optima and have no guarantees of the quality of their solution. In this paper, we treat AOR as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and find near-optimal values and corresponding action-values of training data using Belief Tree Search (BTS) on the AOR belief Markov Decision Process (MDP). AOR then reduces to the problem of knowledge transfer from these action-values to the test set. We train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network on these values to predict the best next action on the training set rollouts and experimentally show that our method generalizes well to explore novel objects and novel views of familiar objects with high accuracy. We compare this supervised scheme against guided policy search, and show that the LSTM network reaches higher recognition accuracy compared to the guided policy search and guided Neurally Fitted Q-iteration. We further look into optimizing the observation function to increase the total collected reward during active recognition. In AOR, the observation function is known only approximately. We derive a gradient-based update for the observation function to increase the total expected reward. We show that by optimizing the observation function and retraining the supervised LSTM network, the AOR performance on the test set improves significantly.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","startPage":"4276","endPage":"4283","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206290.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Belief tree search for active object recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Training","Approximation algorithms","Vegetation","Object recognition","Search problems","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision theory","iterative methods","Markov processes","neural nets","object recognition","search problems","tree searching","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["observation function","Belief tree search","active object recognition","unsupervised learning problem","optimal trajectories","object inspection","label uncertainty","reinforcement learning","Partially Observable Markov Decision Process","near-optimal values","Belief Tree Search","Long Short Term Memory network","higher recognition accuracy","active recognition","LSTM","Markov Decision Process","BTS","Long Short Term Memory","BTS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Belief tree search for active object recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206290/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206290/","accessionNumber":"17428449","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Belief tree search for active object recognition","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10883S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8206317,"authors":[{"name":"Dhaivat Bhatt","affiliation":["KCIS, IIIT Hyderabad"],"firstName":"Dhaivat","lastName":"Bhatt","id":"37086310106"},{"name":"Danish Sodhi","affiliation":["KCIS, IIIT Hyderabad"],"firstName":"Danish","lastName":"Sodhi","id":"37086307899"},{"name":"Arghya Pal","affiliation":["IIT-Hyderabad"],"firstName":"Arghya","lastName":"Pal","id":"37085650066"},{"name":"Vineeth Balasubramanian","affiliation":["IIT-Hyderabad"],"firstName":"Vineeth","lastName":"Balasubramanian","id":"37409169100"},{"name":"Madhava Krishna","affiliation":["KCIS, IIIT Hyderabad"],"firstName":"Madhava","lastName":"Krishna","id":"37274561000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206317","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206317","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Feature extraction","Visualization","Computer architecture","Cameras","Sensors","Laser radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image recognition","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame sequence","IntersectNet","deep learning-based approach","hierarchical visual feature extractor","Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network","Long-short term memory networks models","binary classification task","road intersection detection","monocular cameras","recurrent sequence model"]}],"abstract":"Long-short term memory networks(LSTM) models have shown considerable performance on variety of problems dealing with sequential data.

The robust autonomy of the system, guaranteed in part through the addition of this robotic arm, is a main contributing factor.

Our approach has been tested both offline, on datasets captured from three different robotic systems and online, on a physical system.

The heuristic is generated by storing minimum spanning trees from a small number of vertices within the PRM graph and using these trees to approximate the cost of a shortest path between any two vertices of the graph. The intermediate step of preprocessing the graph increases the time and memory requirements of the classical motion planning technique in exchange for speeding up individual queries making the method advantageous in multi-query applications. This paper investigates these trade-offs on PRM graphs constructed in randomized environments as well as a practical manipulator simulation. We conclude that the method is preferable to Dijkstra's algorithm or the A* algorithm with conventional heuristics in multi-query applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Landmark guided probabilistic roadmap queries","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206358","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206358.pdf","startPage":"4828","endPage":"4834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Landmark guided probabilistic roadmap queries","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206358/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17418349","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Landmark guided probabilistic roadmap queries","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064034S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8206370,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086336612"},{"name":"You-Fu Li","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"You-Fu","lastName":"Li","id":"37279884400"},{"name":"Dan Su","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Su","id":"37086117273"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206370","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuses","Computer architecture","Convolution","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","gradient methods","image colour analysis","image fusion","learning (artificial intelligence)","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RGB-D salient object detection","flexible fusion mechanism","adaptive fusion mechanism","multipath way","fusion process","depth information","multiscale multipath multimodal fusion network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206370","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206370.pdf","startPage":"4911","endPage":"4916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M<sup>3</sup>Net: Multi-scale multi-path multi-modal fusion network and example application to RGB-D salient object detection","abstract":"Fusing RGB and depth data is compelling in boosting performance for various robotic and computer vision tasks. Typically, the streams of RGB and depth information are merged into a single fusion point in an early or late stage to generate combined features or decisions. The single fusion point also means single fusion path, which is congested and inflexible to fuse all the information from different modalities. As a result, the fusion process is brute-force and consequently insufficient. To address this problem, we propose a multi-scale multi-path multi-modal fusion network (M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\nNet), in which the fusion path is scattered to diversify the contributions of each modality from global and local perspectives.

Predicting the performance for a given application requires characterization of both system and environmental components. Furthermore, a SUAV with a transformable airframe increases the number of characterizable states, where each state features a unique set of capabilities. This results in significant differences with respect to power consumption, solar panel orientation, and increases the design limitations on system components. This paper characterizes the energy collection, propulsion, and power electronics subsystems of a transformable SUAV developed at the University of Minnesota. Clear-sky and solar panel models are used to predict the power available for a given location and time. Propulsion system design is validated with flight data, and a proposed model correlates propulsion limits with available energy. Power electronics are modeled and simulated to determine hardware and tracking algorithm efficiencies.

To achieve this, robots must be able to reliably distinguish crops from weeds on different fields and across growth stages. In this paper, we tackle the problem of separating crops from weeds reliably while requiring only a minimal amount of training data through a semi-supervised approach. We exploit the fact that most crops are planted in rows with a similar spacing along the row, which in turn can be used to initialize a vision-based classifier requiring only minimal user efforts to adapt it to a new field. We implemented our approach using C++ and ROS and thoroughly tested it on real farm robots operating in different countries. The experiments presented in this paper show that with around 1 min of labeling time, we can achieve classification results with an accuracy of more than 95% in real sugar beet fields in Germany and Switzerland.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206403","startPage":"5155","endPage":"5161","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206403.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-supervised online visual crop and weed classification in precision farming exploiting plant arrangement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Agriculture","Visualization","Sugar industry","Vegetation mapping","Robots","Feature extraction","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","crops","farming","feature extraction","image classification","industrial robots","robot programming","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training data","semisupervised approach","minimal user efforts","farm robots","classification results","sugar beet fields","precision farming robots","great potential","agro-chemicals","per-plant intervention","growth stages","weed classification","semisupervised online visual crop classification","plant arrangement","C++","ROS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Semi-supervised online visual crop and weed classification in precision farming exploiting plant arrangement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206403/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428816","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-supervised online visual crop and weed classification in precision farming exploiting plant arrangement","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046785S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8206408,"authors":[{"name":"Maurilio Di Cicco","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering \u201cAntonio Ruberti\u201d, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurilio","lastName":"Di Cicco","id":"37085793607"},{"name":"Ciro Potena","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza, Roma, Lazio, IT"],"firstName":"Ciro","lastName":"Potena","id":"37086242890"},{"name":"Giorgio Grisetti","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering \u201cAntonio Ruberti\u201d, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Grisetti","id":"37324134600"},{"name":"Alberto Pretto","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering \u201cAntonio Ruberti\u201d, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Pretto","id":"37542911000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206408","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":646},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Agriculture","Training","Kinematics","Sugar industry","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","crops","feature extraction","image classification","image segmentation","image texture","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic model based dataset generation","weeds detection","selective weeding","agriculture robotics","farm robot","image classification algorithms","deep learning","crop detection","image segmentation","image texture"]}],"abstract":"Selective weeding is one of the key challenges in the field of agriculture robotics. To accomplish this task, a farm robot should be able to accurately detect plants and to distinguish them between crop and weeds. Most of the promising state-of-the-art approaches make use of appearance-based models trained on large annotated datasets. Unfortunately, creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations is an extremely time consuming task, actually penalizing the usage of data-driven techniques. In this paper, we face this problem by proposing a novel and effective approach that aims to dramatically minimize the human intervention needed to train the detection and classification algorithms. The idea is to procedurally generate large synthetic training datasets randomizing the key features of the target environment (i.e., crop and weed species, type of soil, light conditions). More specifically, by tuning these model parameters, and exploiting a few real-world textures, it is possible to render a large amount of realistic views of an artificial agricultural scenario with no effort. The generated data can be directly used to train the model or to supplement real-world images. We validate the proposed methodology by using as testbed a modern deep learning based image segmentation architecture. We compare the classification results obtained using both real and synthetic images as training data. The reported results confirm the effectiveness and the potentiality of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206408","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206408.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","startPage":"5188","endPage":"5195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic model based dataset generation for fast and accurate crop and weeds detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic model based dataset generation for fast and accurate crop and weeds detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206408/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428757","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206408/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic model based dataset generation for fast and accurate crop and weeds detection","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109524S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8206411,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Jing","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Department of Computing Science, Institute of High Performance Computing, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jing","id":"37085809046"},{"name":"Joseph Polden","affiliation":["Mechatronics Group, Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Singapore"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Polden","id":"37073221800"},{"name":"Chun Fan Goh","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Chun Fan","lastName":"Goh","id":"37086281349"},{"name":"Mabaran Rajaraman","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mabaran","lastName":"Rajaraman","id":"37086283092"},{"name":"Wei Lin","affiliation":["Mechatronics Group, Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278115500"},{"name":"Kenji Shimada","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Shimada","id":"37324632500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206411","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel sampling-based motion planning method for shape inspection applications with a redundant robotic system.

Localization is performed with respect to a pre-built map of the environment represented using the distance function of a binary mosaic, avoiding the need for extraction and explicit matching of visual features. Edges extracted from images acquired by an on-board camera are projected to the map to compute an error metric that indicates the misalignment between the predicted and true pose of the UAV. A constrained extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework is used to generate an estimate of the full 6-DOF location of the UAV by enforcing the condition that the distance function values are zero when there is no misalignment. Use of an EKF also makes it possible to seamlessly incorporate information from any other system on the UAV, for example, from its auto-pilot, a height sensor or an optical flow sensor. Experiments using a hexarotor UAV both in a simulation environment and in the field are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206421","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206421.pdf","startPage":"5292","endPage":"5297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance function based 6DOF localization for unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS denied environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206421/","displayDocTitle":"Distance function based 6DOF localization for unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS denied environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17418242","htmlLink":"/document/8206421/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance function based 6DOF localization for unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS denied environments","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060415S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8206425,"authors":[{"name":"Tixiao Shan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Tixiao","lastName":"Shan","id":"37085681623"},{"name":"Brendan Englot","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Brendan","lastName":"Englot","id":"37601539900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206425","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"abstract":"We characterize and propose advances in the technique of Belief Roadmap Search (BRMS), the process of searching a roadmap in belief space for robot motion planning under localization uncertainty.

Practical performance issues of BRMS are discussed, including the implications of a commonly-used anti-cycling rule, and the computational complexity realized in practical applications of the technique. We propose a best-first implementation of BRMS, in contrast to the standard breadth-first implementation, which we show to improve the computational cost of search by up to 49% by eliminating unnecessary node expansions - the mechanics of both approaches are compared in detail.

Robotic assistance offers the opportunity for people with disabilities to perform ADLs on their own. However, when a complex semi-autonomous system provides real-world assistance, occasional anomalies are likely to occur. Robots that can detect, classify and respond appropriately to common anomalies have the potential to provide more effective and safer assistance. We introduce a multimodal execution monitor to detect and classify anomalous executions when robots operate near humans. Our system builds on our past work on multimodal anomaly detection. Our new monitor classifies the type and cause of common anomalies using an artificial neural network. We implemented and evaluated our execution monitor in the context of robot-assisted feeding with a general-purpose mobile manipulator. In our evaluations, our monitor outperformed baseline methods from the literature. It succeeded in detecting 12 common anomalies from 8 able-bodied participants with 83% accuracy and classifying the types and causes of the detected anomalies with 90% and 81% accuracies, respectively. We then performed an in-home evaluation with Henry Evans, a person with severe quadriplegia. With our system, Henry successfully fed himself while the monitor detected, classified the types, and classified the causes of anomalies with 86%, 90%, and 54% accuracy, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206437","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206437.pdf","startPage":"5406","endPage":"5413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multimodal execution monitor with anomaly classification for robot-assisted feeding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206437/","displayDocTitle":"A multimodal execution monitor with anomaly classification for robot-assisted feeding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428797","htmlLink":"/document/8206437/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multimodal execution monitor with anomaly classification for robot-assisted feeding","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11349S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8206469,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Porzi","affiliation":["Institut de Rob\u00f2tica i Inform\u00e0tica Industrial (UPC-CSIC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Porzi","id":"38510437100"},{"name":"Adrian Penate-Sanchez","affiliation":["University College London"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Penate-Sanchez","id":"37073234400"},{"name":"Elisa Ricci","affiliation":["Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy","University of Perugia, Italy"],"firstName":"Elisa","lastName":"Ricci","id":"37299091700"},{"name":"Francesc Moreno-Noguer","affiliation":["Institut de Rob\u00f2tica i Inform\u00e0tica Industrial (UPC-CSIC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Francesc","lastName":"Moreno-Noguer","id":"38274555200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206469","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Pose estimation","Pipelines","Machine learning","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image colour analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","pattern classification","pose estimation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth-aware convolutional neural networks","RGB-D images","scale-adaptive regression model","Convolutional Neural Network","ad hoc energy functions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206469","abstract":"Most recent approaches to 3D pose estimation from RGB-D images address the problem in a two-stage pipeline. First, they learn a classifier-typically a random forest-to predict the position of each input pixel on the object surface. These estimates are then used to define an energy function that is minimized w.r.t. the object pose. In this paper, we focus on the first stage of the problem and propose a novel classifier based on a depth-aware Convolutional Neural Network. This classifier is able to learn a scale-adaptive regression model that yields very accurate pixel-level predictions, allowing to finally estimate the pose using a simple RANSAC-based scheme, with no need to optimize complex ad hoc energy functions.

Knowing the location of the sampling is critical. For a marine robotic network, the location of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) can be measured using a Global Positioning System (GPS), however the navigation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is more challenging. In this paper, we present a method for determining the position of underwater vehicles from a moving USV using the relative range information provided by an Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL)/acoustic modem. The navigation method uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to update the states predicted from a model-based dead-reckoning technique. Since the vehicle model is relative to the surrounding fluid, we have introduced two environmental states in the state matrix. Such a modification allows us to quantify the effects induced by the ocean current on the vehicle's speed. Beyond that, the method uses a limited number of sensors, only attitude sensors and an USBL/acoustic modem, offering an alternative for AUVs without expensive instruments such as a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Experiments are conducted to evaluate the range-based navigation method on a hybrid Slocum underwater glider with an USV. As a result from the reference trial, the estimated glider position stays within the error of 15 meters comparing to the measured position of a surface buoy where the glider is attached. In the open-water trial, trajectories estimated from the range-based navigation are compared with dead-reckoning paths and current-compensated dead-reckoning paths (reference).

We propose an anytime planning technique for efficient data gathering using point-sampling based on non-uniform data-driven coverage. Our goal is to sense a particular region of interest in the environment and be able to reconstruct the measured spatial field. Since there are autonomous agents involved, there is a need to consider the costs involved in terms of energy consumed and time required to finish the task. An ideal map of the scalar field requires complete coverage of the region, but can be approximated by a good sparse coverage strategy along with an efficient interpolation technique. We propose to optimize the trade off between the environmental field mapping and the costs (energy consumed, time spent, and distance traveled) associated with sensing. We present an anytime algorithm for sampling the environment adaptively by following a multi-scale path to produce a variable resolution map of the spatial field. We compare our approach to a traditional exhaustive survey approach and show that we are able to effectively represent a spatial field spending minimum energy. We present results that indicate our sampling technique gathering most informative samples with least travel. We validate our approach through simulations and test the system on real robots in the open ocean.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206511","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206511.pdf","startPage":"6111","endPage":"6117","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven selective sampling for marine vehicles using multi-scale paths","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven selective sampling for marine vehicles using multi-scale paths","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206511/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17418305","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206511/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven selective sampling for marine vehicles using multi-scale paths","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1818.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065667S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8206512,"authors":[{"name":"Hafez Farazi","affiliation":["Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS) Group, University of Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Hafez","lastName":"Farazi","id":"38667008000"},{"name":"Sven Behnke","affiliation":["Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS) Group, University of Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Behnke","id":"37295987100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206512","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":636},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206512","abstract":"Collaborative robots working on a common task are necessary for many applications.

The actuation of such robots with non-straight tendons that wrap around the backbone, described by a variable function, offers a lot of untapped potentials. While it has been shown that these continuum robots are able to take up complex shapes using only one actuated segment, the merits of non-straight tendon routing have not been quantified in terms of workspace and motion. In this paper, we show that one additional helically routed tendon can greatly benefit the robot's reachable workspace. For instance, the reachable workspace of a one-segment robot with 3 conventional straight tendons increases by 400 % by adding one helically routed tendon. Furthermore, the dexterity of such a continuum robot is improved, i.e. motion sequences to avoid obstacles or to twine an object for grasping. For the first time, the potential of tendon-driven continuum robots with two segments and helically routed tendons is investigated. The general findings on the merits of helical tendon routing are supported with both simulation and experimental results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tendons","Routing","Shape","Force","Strain","Robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","collision avoidance","design engineering","dexterous manipulators","force control","manipulator kinematics","medical robotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["helical tendon routing","continuum robot","tendon-driven continuum robots","nonstraight tendons","reachable workspace","one-segment robot","motion sequences"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206554","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206554","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206554.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206554","startPage":"6470","endPage":"6476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the merits of helical tendon routing in continuum robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the merits of helical tendon routing in continuum robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206554/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206554/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428631","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the merits of helical tendon routing in continuum robots","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048841S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8206579,"authors":[{"name":"Huy X.

A key task for firefighters is to observe the \u201cfire front\u201d to chart the progress of the fire and areas it will likely spread next.

Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to cover wildfire is promising because it can replace humans for fire tracking, reducing hazards and saving operation costs. In this paper we propose a distributed control framework designed for a team of UAVs that can closely monitor a wildfire in open space, and precisely track its development. The UAV team, designed for flexible deployment, can effectively avoid in-flight collisions and cooperate well with neighbors. They can maintain a certain height level to the ground for safe flight above fire.

Reducing energy usage is one of the main challenges in advancing aerial robot utility. To address this bottleneck in the development of unmanned aerial vehicle applications, this work proposes an bioinspired mechanical approach and develops an aerial robotic system for greater endurance enabled by low power station-keeping. The aerial robotic system consists of an multirotor MAV and anchoring modules capable of launching multiple tensile anchors to fixed structures in its operating envelope. The resulting tensile perch is capable of providing a mechanically stabilized mode for high accuracy operation in 3D workspace. We explore generalised geometric and static modelling of the stabilisation concept using screw theory. Following the analytical modelling of the integrated robotic system, the tensile anchoring modules employing high pressure gas actuation are designed, prototyped and then integrated to a quadrotor platform. The presented design is validated with experimental tests, demonstrating the stabilization capability even in a windy environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206606.pdf","startPage":"6849","endPage":"6854","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SpiderMAV: Perching and stabilizing micro aerial vehicles with bio-inspired tensile anchoring systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Force","Three-dimensional displays","Fasteners","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","biomimetics","control system synthesis","energy consumption","helicopters","mechanical stability","mobile robots","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flight endurance","energy usage","aerial robot utility","unmanned aerial vehicle applications","bioinspired mechanical approach","aerial robotic system","greater endurance","low power station-keeping","multirotor MAV","multiple tensile anchors","resulting tensile perch","mechanically stabilized mode","high accuracy operation","integrated robotic system","tensile anchoring modules","high pressure gas actuation","stabilization capability","perching","bio-inspired tensile anchoring systems","SpiderMAV","MicroAerial Vehicles perching","microaerial vehicles stabilization","quadrotor platform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"SpiderMAV: Perching and stabilizing micro aerial vehicles with bio-inspired tensile anchoring systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8206606/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428329","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SpiderMAV: Perching and stabilizing micro aerial vehicles with bio-inspired tensile anchoring systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061376S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8206607,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

However, current multicopters for delivery can be dangerous for people, and are difficult to store and transport. Safety issues arise because users are exposed to unshielded spinning propellers. Transportation to the place of deployment and storage is often impaired by the large size that is required for heavy lifting. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing the integration of a quadcopter into a foldable protective cage. The cage provides an all-round protective structure that physically separates the propellers from the environment, ensuring the safety of people. The drone and the cage can be easily folded with a single movement, significantly reducing its size for ease of storage and transportation. This design has been validated with a quadcopter that can lift parcels up to 500 g and reduce its storage volume by 92% when folded.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206607","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206607.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","startPage":"6855","endPage":"6862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An origami-inspired cargo drone","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An origami-inspired cargo drone","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8206607/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17428560","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8206607/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An origami-inspired cargo drone","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064537S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119304","isNumber":"8202121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119304","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8202121","articleId":"8206607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8206626,"authors":[{"name":"Yongqiang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085721329"},{"name":"Yu Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37291603500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2683-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"8206626","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":482},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Force","Training","Containers","Force feedback","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force feedback","human-robot interaction","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force estimation system","pouring characteristics","cooking scenarios","pouring trajectory generation approach","force feedback","recurrent neural networks","pouring demonstrations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206626","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2017.8206626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8202121","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119304/8202121/08206626.pdf","startPage":"7005","endPage":"7010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to pour","abstract":"Pouring is a simple task people perform daily.

These MMIC's are used for a Radio Astronomical receiver, which needs the ultimate super low-noise and wide-band frequency characteristics, such as those in ALMA Band 1. The MMIC chips were designed in the coplanar waveguide (CPW), and mounted to the AlN substrate with a flip-chip assembly, which was promising compared to wire bonding. The flip-chip assemblies, however, are prone to cause the parasitic parallel plate resonance mode (PPM). The relationship between the \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$S$</tex>\n-parameters and the PPM was investigated by using a 3D-electromagnetic simulation of the simple transmission-line test-chip with the same chip size as that of the actual MMIC. In order to eliminate the PPM, additional bumps were mounted on the simple transmission-line test-chip, and the effect of these bumps was confirmed by the simulation. These results obtained from the simple transmission-line test-chip were applied to an actual MMIC chip assembly. The MMIC assembled with the additional bumps had no abnormality in the measured \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$S$</tex>\n-parameters, and the PPM had been eliminated up to 65 GHz. Moreover, the stability factor, \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$K$</tex>\n, became more than 2.4 over 36\u201345 GHz. This InP low-noise amplifier MMIC exhibited a gain of 15 dB and a noise temperature of 180\u2013240 K at room temperature in the frequency range of 36\u201345 GHz. When cooled to 28 K, a gain of 17 dB and a noise temperature of 22\u201335 K were obtained at a power consumption of 4.7 mW over 36\u201345 GHz. A high-gain amplifier module consisting of two cascaded chips, exhibited a gain of 27\u201330 dB and a noise temperature of 25\u201330 K at the ambient temperature of 22 K in the frequency range of 41\u201345 GHz.","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["instrumentation: Cryogenic, low-noise, amplifier","methods: VSOP2, ALMA Band 1"]}],"doi":"10.1093/pasj/64.4.71","publicationTitle":"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan","displayPublicationTitle":"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016815/8207261/08207307.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/pasj/64.4.71","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryogenic 36\u201345 GHz InP Low-Noise Amplifier MMIC's with Improved Noise Temperature by Eliminating Parasitic Parallel-Plate Modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8207307","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","displayDocTitle":"Cryogenic 36\u201345 GHz InP Low-Noise Amplifier MMIC's with Improved Noise Temperature by Eliminating Parasitic Parallel-Plate Modes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207307/","volume":"64","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryogenic 36\u201345 GHz InP Low-Noise Amplifier MMIC's with Improved Noise Temperature by Eliminating Parasitic Parallel-Plate Modes","sourcePdf":"pasj640071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062938S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","isNumber":"8207261","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016815","articleId":"8207307","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8207346,"authors":[{"name":"Baotong Chen","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8207346/chen-2783682-small.gif","p":["Baotong Chen received the B.A. degree in mechanical engineering from the Nanyang Institute of Technology, China, 2014.

Millimeter wave frequency is adopted at the mMIMO macro base station (MBS), and the cellular frequency is considered at small cell BS with orthogonal frequency-division multiple access. To lower the hardware cost and energy consumption at the MBS, two hybrid analog/digital precoding schemes are proposed according to the connectivity, i.e., fully connected and subarray structures. In order to design the small cell cluster-based power and subchannel allocation, we aim to maximize the energy efficiency of the system with limited wireless backhaul and users' quality of service constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex mixed integer nonlinear fraction programming, which is non-trivial to solve directly. By exploiting fractional programming, we propose a two-loop iterative resource allocation algorithm to solve the nonconvex problem. Specifically, integer relaxation and a Dinkelback method are considered to transform the outer loop problem into a difference of convex programming (DCP). Following this, the first-order Taylor approximation is considered to linearize this inner loop DCP problem into a convex optimization framework. Lagrange dual problem is considered to obtain the closed-form power allocation. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm. Numerical results are provided to validate our proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08207349.pdf","startPage":"2457","endPage":"2471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for mmWave Massive MIMO HetNets With Wireless Backhaul","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for mmWave Massive MIMO HetNets With Wireless Backhaul","volume":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8207349/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17573795","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207349/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Special Project for Inter-Government Collaboration of State Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2016YFE0118400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1604159"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for mmWave Massive MIMO HetNets With Wireless Backhaul","sourcePdf":"access-hao-2783544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15377S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8207349","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8207351,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Pedro","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal","Coriant Portugal, Amadora, Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["Jo&atilde;o Pedro (M&rsquo;11) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees\n in electrical and computer engineering from the Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico (IST), Lisbon Technical University,\n Lisbon, Portugal, in 2004 and 2011, respectively.","He was a Research Engineer and System Architect for network planning tools at Nokia Siemens Networks between 2008\n and 2010, and 2010 and 2013, respectively.

Combining Raman amplification with Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) is one of the strategies that can be exploited to achieve this objective, especially in the presence of long fiber spans. Given that hybrid Raman/EDFA amplifiers are more expensive than EDFAs, their deployment should also be minimized. However, determining the number and location of these amplifiers in a mesh optical network is a complex problem because of the overlap of lightpaths with different source and destination nodes at each link. A method to optimize the placement of hybrid Raman/EDFA amplifiers in mesh optical networks is described in this paper. The proposed method analyzes the network as a whole and determines where to introduce Raman amplification such that the 3R regenerator count is minimized while also keeping the number of hybrid Raman/EDFA amplifiers at a minimum. It is shown that, in a reference mesh optical network, the proposed method clearly outperforms the simpler placement approach based solely on fiber span attenuation.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2783678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2783678","startPage":"1552","endPage":"1561","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8303833/08207351.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8303833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Hybrid Raman/EDFA Amplifier Placement for DWDM Mesh Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May1, 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Hybrid Raman/EDFA Amplifier Placement for DWDM Mesh Networks","publicationDate":"1 May1, 2018","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2018","volume":"36","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8207351/","accessionNumber":"17582333","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207351/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Hybrid Raman/EDFA Amplifier Placement for DWDM Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-pedro-2783678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063648S","chronDate":"May1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8303833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8303833","articleId":"8207351","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8207419,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"p":["Jun Xu received the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in computer architecture from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently a Research Associate with the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China, and a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong.

Comparing with the legacy human-centric applications, machine type communication scenarios exhibit totally different characteristics, such as low throughput, delay insensitivity, occasional transmission, and deep coverage. Meanwhile, it also requires the terminal devices to be cheap enough and sustain long battery life. These demands hasten the prosperity of low power wide area (LPWA) technologies. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is the newest Long Term Evolution (LTE) specification ratified by the third generation partner project as one of the LPWA solutions to achieve the objectives of super coverage, low power, low cost, and massive connection. Working in the licensed frequency band, it is designed to reuse and coexist with the existing LTE cellular networks, which endows it with outstanding advantages in decreasing network installation cost and minimizing product time-to-market. In this backdrop, it has been extensively regarded as one of the most promising technologies toward the IoT landscape. However, as a new LTE standard, there are still a lot of challenges that need to overcome. This paper surveys its evolutions, technologies, and issues, spanning from performance analysis, design optimization, combination with other leading technologies, to implementation and application. The goal is to deliver a holistic understanding for the emerging wireless communication system, in helping to spur further research in accelerating the broad use of NB-IoT.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840462","htmlLink":"/document/8207419/","displayDocTitle":"Narrowband Internet of Things: Evolutions, Technologies, and Open Issues","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"China NSFC","grantNumber":"61472259, 61702343 and 61502313"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Guangdong NSF","grantNumber":"2017A030312008"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Foundation","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170302140946299 and JCYJ20170412110753954"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Funding","grantNumber":"2017M610548"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Talent Project","grantNumber":"2014TQ01X238 and 2015TX01X111"},{"fundingName":"GDUPS(2015)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrowband Internet of Things: Evolutions, Technologies, and Open Issues","sourcePdf":"jiot-wu-2783374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107173S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8375923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"8375923","articleId":"8207419","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8207422,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Noormohammadpour","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8362823/8207422/noorm-2782753-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Noormohammadpour (S\u201917) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, in 2014 and the master\u2019s degree in computer science from the University of Southern California (USC) in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering.

A typical datacenter is made up of thousands of servers connected with a large network and usually managed by one operator. To provide quality access to the variety of applications and services hosted on datacenters and maximize performance, it deems necessary to use datacenter networks effectively and efficiently. Datacenter traffic is often a mix of several classes with different priorities and requirements. This includes user-generated interactive traffic, traffic with deadlines, and long-running traffic. To this end, custom transport protocols and traffic management techniques have been developed to improve datacenter network performance. In this tutorial paper, we review the general architecture of datacenter networks, various topologies proposed for them, their traffic properties, general traffic control challenges in datacenters and general traffic control objectives. The purpose of this paper is to bring out the important characteristics of traffic control in datacenters and not to survey all existing solutions (as it is virtually impossible due to massive body of existing research). We hope to provide readers with a wide range of options and factors while considering a variety of traffic control mechanisms. We discuss various characteristics of datacenter traffic control, including management schemes, transmission control, traffic shaping, prioritization, load balancing, multipathing, and traffic scheduling. Next, we point to several open challenges as well as new and interesting networking paradigms. At the end of this paper, we briefly review inter-datacenter networks that connect geographically dispersed datacenters, which have been receiving increasing attention recently and pose interesting and novel research problems. To measure the performance of datacenter networks, different performance metrics have been used, such as flow completion times, deadline miss rate, throughput, and fairness. Depending on the application and user requirements, some metrics may need more attention. While investigating different traffic control techniques, we point out the tradeoffs involved in terms of costs, complexity, and performance. We find that a combination of different traffic control techniques may be necessary at particular entities and layers in the network to improve the variety of performance metrics. We also find that despite significant research efforts, there are still open problems that demand further attention from the research community.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2782753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8362823","startPage":"1492","endPage":"1525","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8362823/08207422.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Datacenter Traffic Control: Understanding Techniques and Tradeoffs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8207422/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Datacenter Traffic Control: Understanding Techniques and Tradeoffs","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2018","accessionNumber":"17829221","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Datacenter Traffic Control: Understanding Techniques and Tradeoffs","sourcePdf":"comst-noormohammadpour-2782753-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.24246S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8362823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8362823","articleId":"8207422","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8207424,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8249504/8207424/yang-2783367-small.gif","p":["Xu Yang was born in Bazhong, China, in 1985.

Consequently, their detection, reorganization, and tracking are of considerable significance. However, the traditional solutions, including ground-based radar and optical telescope, cannot exactly observe the debris with small diameter. Imaging with space-based terahertz (THz) radar in combination with inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) technique enables us to obtain high-resolution 3-D image. In this paper, we have developed a high-resolution THz radar that operates at 340 GHz with a bandwidth of 28.8 GHz and the output peak power of 5 mW for proof-of-concept. In addition, using the characteristic that space debris rotates about its main axis, we have established a 3-D ISAR imaging geometry as well as its corresponding signal model. Then, a 3-D wavenumber-domain image formation algorithm is presented and has been validated by point target simulation. The experimental results have confirmed that the THz radar can effectively achieve high-resolution 3-D imaging of the spinning space debris.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17485785","volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8207424/","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Imaging of Space Debris With Space-Based Terahertz Radar","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1433113"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2015J020"},{"fundingName":"Project 2011 for Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Imaging of Space Debris With Space-Based Terahertz Radar","sourcePdf":"jsen-yang-2783367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0807S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8249504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8249504","articleId":"8207424","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8207426,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim A.

In this paper, we present a survey of the mmWave propagation characteristics, channel modeling, and design guidelines, such as system and antenna design considerations for mmWave, including the link budget of the network, which are essential for mmWave communication systems. We commence by introducing the main channel propagation characteristics of mmWaves followed by channel modeling and design guidelines. Then, we report on the main measurement and modeling campaigns conducted in order to understand the mmWave band's properties and present the associated channel models. We survey the different channel models focusing on the channel models available for the 28, 38, 60, and 73 GHz frequency bands. Finally, we present the mmWave channel model and its challenges in the context of mmWave communication systems design.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2783541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8362823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2783541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8362823/08207426.pdf","startPage":"870","endPage":"913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Communications: Physical Channel Models, Design Considerations, Antenna Constructions, and Link-Budget","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Communications: Physical Channel Models, Design Considerations, Antenna Constructions, and Link-Budget","volume":"20","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8207426/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2018","accessionNumber":"17829222","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207426/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/Noo4558/1 and EP/L018659/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant under the Beam-Me-Up Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society\u2019s Wolfson Research Merit Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Millimeter-Wave Communications: Physical Channel Models, Design Considerations, Antenna Constructions, and Link-Budget","sourcePdf":"comst-hanzo-2783541-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.478703S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8362823","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"8362823","articleId":"8207426","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8207583,"authors":[{"name":"Zihao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8467416/8207583/zliu-2783860-small.gif","p":["Zihao Liu received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include statistical computer-aided design for emerging nonvolatile memories and energy-efficient deep learning systems.","Dr. Liu was a recipient of the Graduate Travel Award of the 2016 Non-Volatile Memories Workshop, and the best paper nomination from ASP-DAC 2018."]},"firstName":"Zihao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086167171"},{"name":"Mengjie Mao","affiliation":["Department of Control Design Automation, MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8467416/8207583/mao-2783860-small.gif","p":["Mengjie Mao received the B.S. degree in computer science from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, the M.S. degree in computer science from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, in 2016.","He is currently a Senior Software Engineer with MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA."]},"firstName":"Mengjie","lastName":"Mao","id":"37085491501"},{"name":"Tao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8467416/8207583/tliu-2783860-small.gif","p":["Tao Liu (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in computer engineering from Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His current research interests include neuromorphic computing and deep learning security/acceleration.","Mr. Liu was a recipient of the 54th Design Automation Conference (DAC) in 2017, the A.

To increase the storage density, multilevel cell (MLC) technique was recently introduced to STT-RAM designs at the cost of degraded access speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. Existing MLC STT-RAM cache architectures primarily focus on the performance and energy optimizations but ignore the crucial demand for reliability. In this paper, we propose \u201cTriZone\u201d-a holistic design scheme for MLC STT-RAM cache to simultaneously meet the requirements of performance, energy, and reliability. Three cache block configurations, namely hard, soft, and mixed, are constructed with the hard-bit, soft-bit, and both hard-bit and soft-bit of MLC STT-RAM, respectively. By observing the difference of these cache blocks, a nonuniform strength ECC (NUS-ECC) is developed to guarantee the operational reliability of a cache block with a variable decoding delay adapting to the needs of error correction (e.g., the number of the erroneous bits). The whole MLC STT-RAM cache is then partitioned into three regions, each of which is composed of different cache blocks. In order to achieve the best tradeoff among performance, energy, and reliability, we then introduce the dynamic cache partitioning to determine the partition of this tri-way MLC STT-RAM cache according to the runtime characteristic of various applications. Experiment results show that compared with conventional performance-driven MLC STT-RAM cache design with pessimistic ECC, TriZone can improve the system performance and energy by averagely 11.7% (10.0%) and 13.3% (15.7%), respectively, for single-threaded (multiprogram) applications. The additional area overhead associated with NUS-ECC is limited by ~ 3%.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/43/8467416/8207583-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207583/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18111579","htmlLink":"/document/8207583/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2018","volume":"37","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"TriZone: A Design of MLC STT-RAM Cache for Combined Performance, Energy, and Reliability Optimizations","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1744082 and CCF-1725456"},{"fundingName":"Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-SC0018064"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61472322, 91538202 and 91338103"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"TriZone: A Design of MLC STT-RAM Cache for Combined Performance, Energy, and Reliability Optimizations","sourcePdf":"tcad-liu-2783860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105717S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8467416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","xplore-issue":"8467416","articleId":"8207583","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8207586,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Gao","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8287843/8207586/gao-2783627-small.gif","p":["Bin Gao (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in communications and signal processing from Southwest Jiao Tong University, China, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) in communications and signal processing and the Ph.D. degree from Newcastle University, U.K., in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

Image segmentation is considered essential for identifying and sizing defects. To attain a high-level performance, specific physics-based models that describe defects generation and enable the precise extraction of target region are of crucial importance. In this paper, an effective genetic first-order statistical image segmentation algorithm is proposed for quantitative crack detection. The proposed method automatically extracts valuable spatial-temporal patterns from unsupervised feature extraction algorithm and avoids a range of issues associated with human intervention in laborious manual selection of specific thermal video frames for processing. An internal genetic functionality is built into the proposed algorithm to automatically control the segmentation threshold to render enhanced accuracy in sizing the cracks. Eddy current pulsed thermography will be implemented as a platform to demonstrate surface crack detection. Experimental tests and comparisons have been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method. In addition, a global quantitative assessment index F-score has been adopted to objectively evaluate the performance of different segmentation algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17561976","pubMedId":"29432098","volume":"27","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8207586/","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Physics-Based Image Segmentation Using First Order Statistical Properties and Genetic Algorithm for Inductive Thermography Imaging","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401071 and 61527803"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSAF","grantNumber":"U1430115"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC IAA Phase 2 through the 3D Super-Fast and Portable Eddy Current Pulsed Thermography for Railway Inspection Project","grantNumber":"EP/K503885/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physics-Based Image Segmentation Using First Order Statistical Properties and Genetic Algorithm for Inductive Thermography Imaging","sourcePdf":"tip-gao-2783627-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061701S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8287843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8287843","articleId":"8207586","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":8207598,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqing Lu","affiliation":["School of Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8454923/8207598/lu-2783334-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqing Lu received the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from\n Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2012.","She is currently a Professor with the School of Power and Mechanical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.\n She is also a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the School of Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia.

A droop-based distributed secondary control scheme and a distributed tertiary control scheme are presented based on the iterative learning mechanics, by which the control inputs are merely updated at the end of each round of iteration, and thus, each DG only needs to share information with its neighbors intermittently in a low-bandwidth communication manner. A two-layer sparse communication network is modeled by pinning one or some DGs (pinned DGs) from the lower network of each MG to constitute an upper network. Under this control framework, the tertiary level generates the frequency/voltage references based on the active/reactive power mismatch among MGs while the pinned DGs propagate these references to their neighbors in the secondary level, and the frequency/voltage nominal set points for each DG in the primary level can be finally adjusted based on the frequency/voltage errors. Stability analysis of the two-layer control system is given, and sufficient conditions on the upper bound of the sampling period ratio of the tertiary layer to the secondary layer are also derived. The proposed controllers are distributed, and thus, allow different numbers of heterogeneous DGs in each MG.

Tensor-Based Approach to L-Shaped Arrays Processing With Enhanced Degrees of Freedom","abstract":"A new tensor-based approach, which is capable of significantly increasing the degrees of freedom (DOF) of an L-shaped array consisting of two orthogonal uniform linear arrays (ULAs), is proposed. By dividing each ULA into some overlapping subarrays and then combining their received signals into a data tensor, a new cross-correlation tensor between the two data tensors from the two ULAs is built. Analyses show that such a cross-correlation tensor can be transformed into an equivalent received data matrix of a virtual uniform rectangular array (URA). Under the constraint of a fixed actual number of physical sensors, the optimal number of the subarrays is found by maximizing the DOF of the URA. It is shown that a virtual URA with approximately 0.34(M + 1)2 DOF can be obtained from an L-shaped array with 2M physical sensors. To exploit the increased DOF for the two dimensional (2-D) DOA estimation without the multidimensional search, a parallel factor (PARAFAC) model of the URA is provided so that the PARAFAC decomposition can be utilized to do the 2-D DOA estimation effectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can yield a better estimation performance and resolve more sources than some computationally efficient methods reported in literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8207603/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17466668","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Tensor-Based Approach to L-Shaped Arrays Processing With Enhanced Degrees of Freedom","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571131 and 61401188"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tensor-Based Approach to L-Shaped Arrays Processing With Enhanced Degrees of Freedom","sourcePdf":"lsp-rao-2783370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121455S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"8207709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8207709","articleId":"8207603","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8207605,"authors":[{"name":"Xingcheng Liu","affiliation":["Xinhua College of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8338165/8207605/liu-2783624-small.gif","p":["Xingcheng Liu (SM\u201912) was born in Jiangxi, China.

They usually focused on introducing the construction methods for good LDPC codes instead of a general method for code optimization. This paper proposes a method with high versatility, called the parallel vector message passing-based edge exchange (PMPE), for optimizing a type of graph-based LDPC codes, without changing the code parameters of mother codes, such as the code length, code rate, and degree distribution. With the approximately nearest codewords searching approach, we find the optimization method can increase the Hamming distance of the LDPC codes. For the quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes, an optimization method, called the parallel vector message passing oriented-to the QC-LDPC codes (QC-PMP), is further suggested, with which the quasi-cyclic characteristics of QC-LDPC codes can remain unchanged in the optimization. To evaluate the performance of the parity-check matrix corresponding to a Tanner graph, a very simple metric, the cycles metric, is introduced to work with the proposed PMPE and QC-PMP algorithms. The experimental results show that the performance of the LDPC codes optimized with the proposed PMPE can be improved significantly at low BER range compared with the mother codes of the random codes, including the regular MacKay code of rate 0.5 and the regular PEG code of rate 0.9. For the case of the regular and irregular QC-LDPC codes with different code lengths and code rates, the optimized LDPC codes with the proposed QC-PMP algorithm significantly outperform the mother codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","volume":"66","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17713535","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8207605/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of Binary LDPC Codes With Parallel Vector Message Passing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572534 and 61602531"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Binary LDPC Codes With Parallel Vector Message Passing","sourcePdf":"tcomm-liu-2783624-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143729S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8207605","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8207607,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqi Xie","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Embedded and Network Computing of Hunan Province, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/24/8305671/8207607/xie-2778070-small.gif","p":["Guoqi Xie (M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science\n and engineering from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2014.","He is currently an Associate Professor of computer science and engineering with Hunan University.

In this study, we solve the problem of minimizing the development cost of a distributed automotive function while satisfying its reliability goal during the design phase by presenting two heuristic algorithms, reliabilitycalculation of scheme (RCS) and minimizing development cost with reliability goal (MDCRG). We first use RCS to calculate the reliability value of each ASIL decomposition scheme; then, the MDCRG is used to select the scheme with the minimum development cost while satisfying the reliability goal. Real-life benchmark and simulated functions based on real parameter values are used in experiments, and results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","startPage":"196","endPage":"211","doi":"10.1109/TR.2017.2778070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2017.2778070","pdfPath":"/iel7/24/8305671/08207607.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8305671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing Development Cost With Reliability Goal for Automotive Functional Safety During Design Phase","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207607/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing Development Cost With Reliability Goal for Automotive Functional Safety During Design Phase","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17600064","volume":"67","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8207607/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Plan of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0200405"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702172, 61672217, 61173036, 61379115, 61402170, 61370097, 61502162 and 61502405"},{"fundingName":"CCF-Venustech Open Research Fund","grantNumber":"CCF-VenustechRP2017012"},{"fundingName":"CERNET Innovation Project","grantNumber":"NGII20161003"},{"fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M592422"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing Development Cost With Reliability Goal for Automotive Functional Safety During Design Phase","sourcePdf":"tr-xie-2778070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114902S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"8305671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8305671","articleId":"8207607","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8207610,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Bo Zhang received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Beijing University\n of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2010 and 2016, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher.

However, they are limited to energy constraint, especially for long-term, long-distance sensing tasks, and cities are almost too crowded to set stationary charging station. Towards this end, in this paper we propose to leverage emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for enabling model-free unmanned vehicles control, and present a novel and highly effective control framework, called \u201cDRL-RVC.\u201d It utilizes the powerful convolutional neural network for feature extraction of the necessary information (including sample distribution, traffic flow, etc.), then makes decisions under the guidance of the deep Q network. That is, UAVs will cruise in the city without control and collect most required data in the sensing region, while mobile unmanned charging station will reach the charging point in the shortest possible time. Finally, we validate and evaluate the proposed framework via extensive simulations based on a real dataset in Rome. Extensive simulation results well justify the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2783439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8331183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2783439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8331183/08207610.pdf","startPage":"1666","endPage":"1676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-Based Energy-Efficient Data Collection by Unmanned Vehicles in Smart Cities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning-Based Energy-Efficient Data Collection by Unmanned Vehicles in Smart Cities","volume":"14","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8207610/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17670269","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207610/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772072"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M610828"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-Based Energy-Efficient Data Collection by Unmanned Vehicles in Smart Cities","sourcePdf":"tii-liu-2783439-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117207S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8331183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"8331183","articleId":"8207610","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8207616,"authors":[{"name":"Yunbae Kim","affiliation":["Radio Resource Research Group, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yunbae","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0002-0830-1129","id":"37085595380"},{"name":"Seungkeun Park","affiliation":["Radio Resource Research Group, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungkeun","lastName":"Park","id":"37067905000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8207616","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8207616","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Markov processes","Indexes","Delays","Probability distribution","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","5G mobile communication","cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","Markov processes","probability","quality of service","radio spectrum management","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum requirements","probability distribution","scheduled resource blocks","mobile industry","calculation method","radio authority","scheduled RB","LTE-A","4G-5G systems","stochastic modeling","2D Markov chain model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE-A","spectrum requirement","QoS","M-LWDF","Markov chain"]}],"abstract":"Recently, analytical calculations of spectrum requirements for 4G/5G systems have gained much attention from mobile industry and radio authority worldwide.

Although reactive neural networks easily learn expert behaviors and are computationally efficient, they suffer from generalization of policies learned in specific environments. As such, reinforcement learning and value iteration approaches for learning generalized policies have been proposed. However, these approaches are more costly. In this letter, we tackle the problem of learning reactive neural networks that are applicable to general environments. The key concept is to crop, rotate, and rescale an obstacle map according to the goal location and the agent's current location so that the map representation will be better correlated with self-movement in the general navigation task, rather than the layout of the environment. Furthermore, in addition to the obstacle map, we input a map of visited locations that contains the movement history of the agent, in order to avoid failures that the agent travels back and forth repeatedly over the same location. Experimental results reveal that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art value iteration network in the grid-world navigation task. We also demonstrate that the proposed model can be well generalized to unseen obstacles and unknown terrain. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed system enables a mobile robot to successfully navigate in a real dynamic environment.","doi":"10.1109/LRA.2017.2783400","startPage":"696","endPage":"703","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/8214927/08207619.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2017.2783400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8214927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GOSELO: Goal-Directed Obstacle and Self-Location Map for Robot Navigation Using Reactive Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Path planning","Robots","Neural networks","Agriculture","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","navigation","neurocontrollers","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid-world navigation task","robot navigation","reactive neural networks","deep neural networks","reinforcement learning","general environments","obstacle map","goal location","map representation","general navigation task","visited locations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning in robotics and automation","visual-based navigation","recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207619/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"GOSELO: Goal-Directed Obstacle and Self-Location Map for Robot Navigation Using Reactive Neural Networks","volume":"3","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8207619/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17447686","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"GOSELO: Goal-Directed Obstacle and Self-Location Map for Robot Navigation Using Reactive Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"lra-kanezaki-2783400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08014S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"8214927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8214927","articleId":"8207619","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8207622,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Hussen Abdelaziz","affiliation":["Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA","International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/8253682/8207622/abdel-2783545-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Hussen Abdelaziz received the B.Sc. degree in electrical\n engineering and information technology from Alazhar University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2006, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees\n in electrical engineering and information technology from Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany, in 2010 and\n 2015, respectively.

In the last few decades, many approaches for integrating the audio and video modalities were proposed to enhance the performance of automatic speech recognition in both clean and noisy conditions. However, very few studies can be found in the literature that compare different fusion models for AV-ASR. Even less research work compares audiovisual fusion models for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) models using deep neural networks (DNNs). This paper reviews and compares the performance of five audiovisual fusion models: the feature fusion model, the decision fusion model, the multistream hidden Markov model (HMM), the coupled HMM, and the turbo decoders. A complete evaluation of these fusion models is conducted using a standard speaker-independent DNN-based LVCSR Kaldi recipe in three experimental setups: a clean-train-clean-test, a clean-train-noisy-test, and a matched-training setup. All experiments have been applied to the recently released NTCD-TIMIT audiovisual corpus. The task of NTCD-TIMIT is phone recognition in continuous speech. Using NTCD-TIMIT with its freely available visual features and 37 clean and noisy acoustic signals allows for this study to be a common benchmark, to which novel LVCSR AV-ASR models and approaches can be compared.","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8253682/08207622.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Fusion Models for DNN-Based Audiovisual Continuous Speech Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2017.2783545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8253682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2017.2783545","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8207622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Fusion Models for DNN-Based Audiovisual Continuous Speech Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17485415","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8207622/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)"},{"fundingName":"Fit World Wide \u201cFITweltweit\u201d program"},{"fundingName":"German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Fusion Models for DNN-Based Audiovisual Continuous Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"taslp-husssenabdelaziz-2783545-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088124S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8253682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8253682","articleId":"8207622","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8207624,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Tang","orcid":"0000-0001-6517-0383","id":"37086039254"},{"name":"Zaiping Nie","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zaiping","lastName":"Nie","orcid":"0000-0002-9563-4115","id":"37271589400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8207624","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":906},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has shown its great capabilities in improving spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, yet the high complexity and cost of hardware are huge challenges. In massive MIMO, antenna selection (AS) is still an effective way to decrease the number of radio frequency chains. In this letter, the AS problem in massive MIMO systems is studied with the consideration of maximizing the channel capacity. To eliminate the limitation of the traditional square maximum-volume (SMV) AS method, the theory of rectangular maximum-volume (RMV) submatrices is introduced. An AS algorithm based on RMV method is also developed for massive MIMO, which can be regarded as a postprocessing of the results of SMV method. Based on the result obtained from SMV method, the proposed algorithm can select a rectangular submatrix with maximum-volume from the channel matrix. Finally, the numerical simulations are presented to show the validity of the proposed RMV method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/8207709/08207624.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2783350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2783350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8207624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RMV Antenna Selection Algorithm for Massive MIMO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational complexity","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","matrix algebra","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency","massive MIMO systems","maximum-volume submatrices","RMV method","SMV method","RMV antenna selection algorithm","spectral efficiency","numerical simulations","channel matrix","rectangular maximum-volume submatrices","square maximum-volume"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna selection (AS)","massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","rectangular maximum-volume (RVM) submatrices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"RMV Antenna Selection Algorithm for Massive MIMO","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8207624/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17466669","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RMV Antenna Selection Algorithm for Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"lsp-tang-2783350-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049664S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"8207709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8207709","articleId":"8207624","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8207629,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Shao","affiliation":["Electronic Science and Engineering School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Shao","id":"37086431221"},{"name":"Jin Sha","affiliation":["Electronic Science and Engineering School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Sha","id":"37293859700"},{"name":"Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085417787"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8207629","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":952},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8207629","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Computer architecture","Error correction codes","Iterative decoding","Circuits and systems","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","decoding","error correction codes","error statistics","flash memories","memory architecture","NAND circuits","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoder architecture","NAND flash memory","quasicyclic low-density parity-check codes","highly structured QC-LDPC code","dispersed array LDPC codes","DA-LDPC code","code construction","LDPC decoding strategy","error correction performance","hardware-friendly structures","barrel shifters","prohibitive routing complexity","array square","efficient storage architecture","hybrid storage architecture","stair-like structure","(18300, 16470) DA-LDPC code","two-level decision","FPGA emulation platform","bit error rate","BER","column-based shuffle decoding algorithm","CBSD algorithm","normalized-throughput-gate-count-ratio","NTGR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DA-LDPC codes","NAND flash memory","column-based shuffle decoding","ASIC"]}],"abstract":"Quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have become popular in NAND flash memories, owing to their excellent error correction performance and hardware-friendly structures. However, the large scale of barrel shifters result in prohibitive routing complexity. Array LDPC code is a kind of highly structured QC-LDPC code, which provides a good balance of performance, complexity, and throughput. In this brief, a construction method of dispersed array LDPC (DA-LDPC) codes based on an array square is proposed. DA-LDPC codes not only benefit from the array property but also a hybrid and efficient storage architecture due to their stair-like structure. For NAND flash applications, the code construction and decoder architecture of a (18300, 16470) DA-LDPC code is illustrated in this brief, where a two-level decision of LDPC decoding strategy is employed. The numerical results based on an FPGA emulation platform have shown that the error floor of the (18300, 16470) DA-LDPC code is under 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-11</sup>\n in term of bit error rate (BER). Thanks to the well-structured DA-LDPC codes, we can conveniently apply a column-based shuffle decoding (CBSD) algorithm for ease of implementation. The corresponding ASIC implementation results have proved that the decoder architecture of DA-LDPC codes can achieve higher normalized-throughput-gate-count-ratio (NTGR) compared to state-of-art works.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2783438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2783438","startPage":"1014","endPage":"1018","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8423543/08207629.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8423543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dispersed Array LDPC Codes and Decoder Architecture for NAND Flash Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dispersed Array LDPC Codes and Decoder Architecture for NAND Flash Memory","volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2018","accessionNumber":"17989835","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8207629/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFA0202102"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370040 and 61501116"},{"fundingName":"Project on the Industry Key Technologies of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BE2017153"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140636"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System","grantNumber":"2016KF007"},{"fundingName":"PAPD"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dispersed Array LDPC Codes and Decoder Architecture for NAND Flash Memory","sourcePdf":"tcsii-sha-2783438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086102S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8423543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8423543","articleId":"8207629","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8207630,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed S.

However, recent high profile incidents have raised security and privacy-related concerns with the use of these apps. The level of harm that can be inflicted on a victim using these apps can either be physical (e.g., murder, stalking, or sexual assault) or non-physical (e.g., identity theft, harassment, or cyber-stalking). In this paper, we study seven popular Android mobile dating apps, and the Google Chrome browser app (which can be used to access a particular dating service). Using an adversary model, we demonstrate how one can trivially conduct a man-in-the-middle attack against these mobile dating apps. The results of our study reveal that mobile dating apps are, potentially, vulnerable to security risks. In particular, our findings show that an adversary can intercept personal and private information in plaintext. This information can then be used to access a potential victim\u2019s mobile dating app profile. With our findings in mind, we then explain how the Routine Activity Theory can be applied to design mitigation strategies for mobile dating apps.","doi":"10.1109/TSUSC.2017.2783858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274860/9448584/08207632.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9448584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSUSC.2017.2783858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Are You Dating Danger?

Consequently, there exists knowledge from distinct (but possibly related) design exercises, which have either been previously completed or are currently in-progress, that may be leveraged to enhance the optimization performance of a particular target optimization task of interest. Further, it is observed that modern day design cycles are typically distributed in nature, and consist of multiple teams working on associated ideas in tandem. In such environments, vast amounts of related information can become available at various stages of the search process corresponding to some ongoing target optimization exercise. Successfully exploiting this knowledge is expected to be of significant value in many practical settings, where solving an optimization problem from scratch may be exorbitantly costly or time consuming. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose an adaptive knowledge reuse framework for surrogate-assisted multiobjective optimization of computationally expensive problems, based on the novel idea of multiproblem surrogates. This idea provides the capability to acquire and spontaneously transfer learned models across problems, facilitating efficient global optimization. The efficacy of our proposition is demonstrated on a series of synthetic benchmark functions, as well as two practical case studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","volume":"23","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18414585","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2019","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8207638/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiproblem Surrogates: Transfer Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization of Computationally Expensive Problems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001475","fundingName":"Nanyang Technological University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiproblem Surrogates: Transfer Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization of Computationally Expensive Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-tan-2783441-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106689S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8628278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8628278","articleId":"8207638","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8207640,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Boshkovska","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8385566/8207640/boshk-2783628-small.gif","p":["Elena Boshkovska (S\u201915) was born in Skopje, Macedonia.

In order to ensure power-efficient secure communication, physical layer security techniques are exploited to deliberately degrade the channel quality of a multiple-antenna eavesdropper. The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for minimization of the total power consumption in the network, while guaranteeing the quality of service of the information receivers in terms of secrecy rate. The globally optimal solution of the optimization problem is obtained via a 2-D search and semidefinite programming relaxation. To strike a balance between computational complexity and system performance, a low-complexity iterative suboptimal resource allocation algorithm is also proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that both the proposed optimal and suboptimal schemes can significantly reduce the total system power consumption required for guaranteeing secure communication, and unveil the impact of HWIs on the system performance: 1) residual HWIs create a system performance bottleneck in WPCN in the high transmit/receive power regimes; 2) increasing the number of transmit antennas can effectively reduce the power consumption of wireless power transfer and alleviate the performance degradation due to residual HWIs; and 3) imperfect CSI exacerbates the impact of residual HWIs, which increases the power consumption of both wireless power and wireless information transfer.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2783628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8385566/08207640.pdf","startPage":"2642","endPage":"2657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2783628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Efficient and Secure WPCNs With Hardware Impairments and Non-Linear EH Circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8207640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Power-Efficient and Secure WPCNs With Hardware Impairments and Non-Linear EH Circuit","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207640/","publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17839530","htmlLink":"/document/8207640/","volume":"66","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Early Career Researcher Award funding scheme","grantNumber":"DE170100137"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China for Outstanding Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61722109"},{"fundingName":"AvH Professorship Program of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Efficient and Secure WPCNs With Hardware Impairments and Non-Linear EH Circuit","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ng-2783628-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13218S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8385566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8385566","articleId":"8207640","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8207642,"authors":[{"name":"Didace Habineza","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST Institute, Universit\u00e9 Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9/ENSMM/CNRS, Besan\u00e7on, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/8481716/8207642/habin-2772221-small.gif","p":["Didace Habineza received the D.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the Ex-American Institute, Boumerdes University, Boumerd\u00e8s, Algeria, in 2010, the M.Sc. degree in mechatronics from the Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9, Besan\u00e7on, France, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree from the FEMTO-ST Institute, Universit\u00e9 Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9, Besan\u00e7on, in 2015, with a focus on feedforward control of multiaxes piezoelectric systems."]},"firstName":"Didace","lastName":"Habineza","id":"37085548101"},{"name":"Mahmoud Zouari","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST Institute, Universit\u00e9 Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9/ENSMM/CNRS, Besan\u00e7on, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/8481716/8207642/zouar-2772221-small.gif","p":["Mahmoud Zouari received the National Engineering Diploma degree in mechatronics from the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de Technologie et d\u2019Informatique, Tunis, Tunisia, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree in mechatronics from the Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9, Besan\u00e7on, France, in 2015.","He was an Intern at the Department of Automatic Control and MicroMechatronic Systems, FEMTO-ST Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9, in 2015."]},"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Zouari","id":"37085868432"},{"name":"Yann Le Gorrec","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST Institute, Universit\u00e9 Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9/ENSMM/CNRS, Besan\u00e7on, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/8481716/8207642/legor-2772221-small.gif","p":["Yann Le Gorrec (M\u201914) received the Engineering degree in control, electronics, and computer engineering from the National Institute of Applied Sciences, Toulouse, France, in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree from the National Higher School of Aeronautics and Aerospace, Toulouse, with a focus on robust control and self-scheduled controller synthesis.","From 1999 to 2008, he was Associate Professor of Automatic Control with the Laboratory of Control and Chemical Engineering, Lyon Claude Bernard University, Villeurbanne, France.

The principle consists in compensating first the hysteresis, then the creep, and finally the vibration. The proposed compensation technique is multivariable and therefore is also able to reduce the cross couplings that are unwanted phenomena. The experimental tests demonstrate that the hysteresis that initially exceeds 19% is reduced to about 0.01%, while the creep is reduced from 5.5% to 0.04%. Regarding the vibration, the related overshoot that was initially 45% is completely removed. Note to Practitioners-This paper describes an approach to control and to automate dexterous precise positioning systems based on multiaxes piezoelectric actuators (PEAs). Two problems have motivated the approach investigated in this paper: 1) the presence of nonlinearities (hysteresis and creep), of badly damped vibration and of cross couplings in the multiaxes PEAs and 2) the lack of convenient sensors to feedback control them. Therefore, this paper proposes multivariable and complete feedforward control approach that does not require external sensors. This sensorless control architecture permits a low-cost and a high integration feature additionally to the fact that it is of great interest in applications at small scales where implementation of real-time measurement system is often difficult.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Creep","Vibrations","Sensors","Couplings","Piezoelectric actuators","Feedforward

There has been considerable work on improving loop pipelining, which mainly focuses on optimizing static operation scheduling and parallel memory accesses. Nonetheless, when loops contain complex memory dependencies, current techniques cannot generate high performance pipelines. In this paper, we extend the capability of loop pipelining in HLS to handle loops with uncertain dependencies (i.e., parameterized by an undetermined variable) and/or nonuniform dependencies (i.e., varying between loop iterations). Our optimization allows a pipeline to be statically scheduled without the aforementioned memory dependencies, but an associated controller will change the execution speed of loop iterations at runtime. This allows the augmented pipeline to process each loop iteration as fast as possible without violating memory dependencies. We use a parametric polyhedral analysis to generate the control logic for when to safely run all loop iterations in the pipeline and when to break the pipeline execution to resolve memory conflicts. Our techniques have been prototyped in an automated source-to-source code transformation framework, with Xilinx Vivado HLS, a leading HLS tool, as the RTL generation backend. Over a suite of benchmarks, experiments show that our optimization can implement optimized pipelines at almost the same clock speed as without our transformations, running approximately 3.7-10\u00d7 faster, with a reasonable resource overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2017.2783363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8440579/08207646.pdf","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2017.2783363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8440579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polyhedral-Based Dynamic Loop Pipelining for High-Level Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8207646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207646/","displayDocTitle":"Polyhedral-Based Dynamic Loop Pipelining for High-Level Synthesis","volume":"37","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18027044","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8207646/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P010040/1, EP/I020357/1 and EP/K034448/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"Royal Academy of Engineering"},{"fundingName":"Imagination Technologies"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polyhedral-Based Dynamic Loop Pipelining for High-Level Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tcad-liu-2783363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082212S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8440579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8440579","articleId":"8207646","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8207648,"authors":[{"name":"Yo-Seb Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8338165/8207648/jeon-2783625-small.gif","p":["Yo-Seb Jeon received the B.S.

This achievability is shown by a blind interference management method that exploits the relativity in delay spreads between desired and interfering links. In this method, all inter-cell-interference signals are aligned-and-cancelled by using discrete-Fourier-transform-based precoding and combining, both depend only on the lengths of channel-impulse-response. In addition to the DoF analysis, the achievable rate of the proposed method is characterized in a closed-form expression. Some illustrative examples are presented to show an additional sum-DoF gain obtained by exploiting propagation delay in the interfering links or the heterogeneity of the channel coherence time between the desired and interfering links.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2783625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2783625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08207648.pdf","startPage":"1772","endPage":"1786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom and Achievable Rate of Wide-Band Multi-Cell Multiple Access Channels With No CSIT","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8338165/8207648-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom and Achievable Rate of Wide-Band Multi-Cell Multiple Access Channels With No CSIT","volume":"66","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8207648/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699077","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207648/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP)"},{"fundingName":"MSIT of the Korea government","grantNumber":"2017(2016-0-00123)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1559758 and CNS-1715947"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Degrees of Freedom and Achievable Rate of Wide-Band Multi-Cell Multiple Access Channels With No CSIT","sourcePdf":"tcomm-lee-2783625-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149694S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8207648","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8207649,"authors":[{"name":"Mouhyemen Khan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/8543256/8207649/khan-2777866-small.gif","p":["Mouhyemen Khan received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer\n engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.

The availability of low-cost mobile robots equipped with a variety of sensors makes them promising in target coverage tasks. They are particularly suitable where quick, inexpensive, or nonlasting visual sensing solutions are required. In this paper, we consider the problem of low complexity target tracking to cover and follow moving targets using flying robots. We tackle this problem by clustering targets while estimating the camera location and orientation for each cluster separately through a cover-set coverage method. We also leverage partial knowledge of target mobility to enhance the efficiency of our proposed algorithms. Three computationally efficient approaches are developed: predictive fuzzy, predictive incremental fuzzy, and local incremental fuzzy. The objective is to find a compromise among coverage efficiency, traveled distance, number of drones required, and complexity. The targets move according to one of the following three possible mobility patterns: random waypoint, Manhattan grid, and reference point group mobility patterns. The feasibility of our algorithms and their performance are also tested on a real-world indoor testbed called drone-be-gone, using Parrot AR.Drone quadcopters.

The proposed approach, called nonsurjective finite alphabet iterative decoders (NS-FAIDs), exploits the robustness of message-passing LDPC decoders to inaccuracies in the calculation of exchanged messages, and it is shown to provide a unified framework for several designs previously proposed in the literature. NS-FAIDs are optimized by density evolution for regular and irregular LDPC codes, and are shown to provide different tradeoffs between hardware complexity and decoding performance. Two hardware architectures targeting high-throughput applications are also proposed, integrating both Min-Sum (MS) and NS-FAID decoding kernels. ASIC post synthesis implementation results on 65-nm CMOS technology show that NS-FAIDs yield significant improvements in the throughput to area ratio, by up to 58.75% with respect to the MS decoder, with even better or only slightly degraded error correction performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2776561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8300457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2776561","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8300457/08207775.pdf","startPage":"508","endPage":"521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of Cost-Effective, High-Throughput LDPC Decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Cost-Effective, High-Throughput LDPC Decoders","volume":"26","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8207775/","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17596419","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207775/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European H2020 Work Program under Project Flex5Gware"},{"fundingName":"Franco-Romanian (ANR-UEFISCDI) Joint Research Program Blanc-2013 under Project DIAMOND"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of Cost-Effective, High-Throughput LDPC Decoders","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-savin-2776561-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145887S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8300457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8300457","articleId":"8207775","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8207783,"authors":[{"name":"Shouyi Yin","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8325040/8207783/yin-2778281-small.gif","p":["Shouyi Yin received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000, 2002, and 2005, respectively.","He was a Research Associate with Imperial College London, London, U.K. He is currently an Associate Professor with the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University.

Thinker is an energy efficient reconfigurable hybrid-NN processor fabricated in 65-nm technology. To achieve high energy efficiency, three optimization techniques are proposed. First, each processing element (PE) supports bit-width adaptive computing to meet various bit-widths of neural layers, which raises computing throughput by 91% and improves energy efficiency by 1.93\u00d7 on average.

However, it is too difficult to effectively train the deep neural networks with limited raw SAR images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to do SAR ATR, in which a multiview deep learning framework was employed. Based on the multiview SAR ATR pattern, we first present a flexible mean to generate adequate multiview SAR data, which can guarantee a large amount of inputs for network training without needing many raw SAR images. Then, a unique deep convolutional neural network containing a parallel network topology with multiple inputs is adopted. The features of input SAR images from different views will be learned by the proposed network layer by layer; meanwhile, the learned features from the distinct views are fused in different layers progressively. Therefore, the proposed framework is able to achieve a superior recognition performance, and requires only a small number of raw SAR images for network training samples generation. Experimental results have shown the superiority of the proposed framework based on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17649910","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8207785/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"23 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SAR Automatic Target Recognition Based on Multiview Deep Learning Framework","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671117"},{"fundingName":"Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR Automatic Target Recognition Based on Multiview Deep Learning Framework","sourcePdf":"tgrs-pei-2776357-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151675S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8323433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"8323433","articleId":"8207785","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":8207786,"authors":[{"name":"Dristy Parveg","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8306523/8207786/parve-2777976-small.gif","p":["Dristy Parveg (S\u201909) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, in 2004, and the M.Sc. degree in electronic/telecommunications engineering from the University of G\u00e4vle, G\u00e4vle, Sweden, in 2009.

In this paper, we consider a three-tier hierarchical m-Health system: 1) the sensor network tier capturing vital signals; 2) the mobile computing network tier processing and routing the sensed data to a fixed remote location; and 3) the back-end network tier processing and analyzing the sensed medical data along with patient's medical history. Based on this architecture, a physical layer security scheme for the second tier is developed and network performance of the introduced scheme is analyzed under different metrics using stochastic geometry. To be specific, secure transmission range and average end-to-end delay are analyzed for two different strategies: the mobile device transmits: 1) to the nearest neighbor and 2) to the furthest neighbor. Furthermore, we consider the cases of full knowledge on eavesdroppers' locations and when such information is unavailable. Results show that transmitting to the nearest neighbor achieves the highest secure transmission distance with the lowest mean delay when full information on eavesdroppers is available.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6488907/8288638/8207789-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8207789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17577610","htmlLink":"/document/8207789/","displayDocTitle":"A Physical Layer Security Scheme for Mobile Health Cyber-Physical Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000148","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1509514 and CNS-1718977"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Physical Layer Security Scheme for Mobile Health Cyber-Physical Systems","sourcePdf":"jiot-liu-2780263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106794S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8288638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8288638","articleId":"8207789","onlineDate":"14 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8207825,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5044-4450-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8207825","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":5539},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"LAN/MAN Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society"}],"abstract":"Clause 116 through Clause 124 and Annex 119A through Annex 120E are added by this amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2015.

We estimate the redshift distributions of the samples using phenomological models, simulations and photometric redshifts, and so derive the spatial correlation lengths. We compare our results with the Galaxies In Cosmological Simulations (GalICS) models of galaxy evolution and with parametrized models of clustering evolution. The GalICS simulations are consistent with our angular correlation functions, but fail to match the spatial clustering inferred from the phenomological models or the photometric redshifts. We find that the uncertainties in the redshift distributions of our samples dominate the statistical errors in our estimates of the spatial clustering. At low redshifts (median z\u2264 0.5), the comoving correlation length is approximately constant, r\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\n= 6.1 \u00b1 0.5\u2003h\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22121</sup>\n Mpc, and then decreases with increasing redshift to a value of 2.9 \u00b1 0.3\u2003h\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22121</sup>\n Mpc for the faintest sample, for which the median redshift is z\u223c 1. We suggest that this trend can be attributed to a decrease in the average galaxy and halo mass in the fainter flux\u2010limited samples, corresponding to changes in the relative numbers of early\u2010 and late\u2010type galaxies. However, we cannot rule out strong evolution of the correlation length over 0.5 < z < 1.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12367.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8209774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12367.x","publicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016813/8209774/08209783.pdf","startPage":"1437","endPage":"1449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering of galaxies at 3.6 \u03bcm in the Spitzer Wide\u2010area Infrared Extragalactic legacy survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Clustering of galaxies at 3.6 \u03bcm in the Spitzer Wide\u2010area Infrared Extragalactic legacy survey","volume":"381","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8209783/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering of galaxies at 3.6 \u03bcm in the Spitzer Wide\u2010area Infrared Extragalactic legacy survey","sourcePdf":"mnras03811437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05889S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","isNumber":"8209774","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016813","articleId":"8209783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
