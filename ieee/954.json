The unmodeled items and unknown bounded disturbances are estimated by the universal approximation ability of adaptive neural network. The nonlinear adaptive neural network controller is designed. The minimum learning parameter technology is used to reduce the computational load. The stability of the control system is proved by Lyapunov second method stability theorem.

Most prior works use neural network-based detectors or complex statistical analysis for adversarial detection. These approaches are computationally intensive and vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To this end, we propose DetectX\u2014A hardware friendly adversarial detection mechanism using hardware signatures like Sum of column Currents (SoI) in memristive crossbars (XBar). We show that adversarial inputs have higher SoI compared to clean inputs. However, the difference is too small for reliable adversarial detection. Hence, we propose a dual-phase training methodology: Phase1 training is geared towards increasing the separation between clean and adversarial SoIs; Phase2 training improves the overall robustness against different strengths of adversarial attacks. For hardware-based adversarial detection, we implement the DetectX module using 32 nm CMOS circuits and integrate it with a Neurosim-like analog crossbar architecture. We perform hardware evaluation of the Neurosim+DetectX system on the Neurosim platform using datasets-CIFAR10(VGG8), CIFAR100(VGG16) and TinyImagenet(ResNet18). Our experiments show that DetectX is 10x-25x more energy efficient and immune to dynamic adversarial attacks compared to previous state-of-the-art works.

It features an advanced double-quadrature direct upconverter (DQ-DUC) to improve its in-band linearity and spectral purity. The proposed TX architecture incorporates an efficiency-enhanced balanced power amplifier (EEBPA) that mitigates VSWR fluctuations in phased-array systems while enhancing efficiency at power back-off (PBO). The EEBPA comprises two identical series-Doherty power amplifiers (PAs) combined through a quadrature hybrid coupler forming a balanced PA. The proposed DQ-DUC consists of a pair of I/Q modulators and the proposed EEBPA\u2019s quadrature combiner to further suppress the I/Q image.

The retina is a thin layer that is the innermost layer of the human eye. In this paper, low-cost hardware implementation for retinal cone cells is performed. Existing mathematical models for implementing the behavior of these cells include a series of nonlinear functions that, if implemented directly, would require a large amount of hardware and, in addition, would not have the desired speed. The proposed model uses multi-linear functions to approximate the nonlinear terms and eliminate the multiplication expressions. The simulation results show that the proposed model tracks the behavior of the original model with high precision. There is also a good match between the main model and the proposed model in terms of dynamic behaviors. The results of hardware implementation using the virtex5 XC5VLX20T (2FF323) reconfigurable board (FPGA) show that the proposed model is fully valid and has a lower hardware volume as well as a 4 times higher frequency, and 22% less power consumption than the original model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Digital Realization of Retinal Light Adaptation in Cone Photoreceptors","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3111202","endPage":"5080","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09540043.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"5072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3111202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540043","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Retina","Mathematical model","Adaptation models","Photoreceptors","Biological system modeling","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware implementation","retina","FPGA","dynamic behavior","light adaptation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Digital Realization of Retinal Light Adaptation in Cone Photoreceptors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540043/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"68","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9540043/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Digital Realization of Retinal Light Adaptation in Cone Photoreceptors","sourcePdf":"tcsi-naderi-3111202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078048S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9540043","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9540048,"authors":[{"name":"Austin Pahl","bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7261654/9540011/9540048/pahl-3096791-small.gif","p":["Austin Pahl is an associate software engineer in Technology Policy at CableLabs, Louisville, CO, and a contributing engineer at the Immersive Digital Experiences Alliance, where he contributes to immersive content production and specification development.

The match is logical: the transition to AV over IP is also happening in the Pro AV space, and many members of AIMS are active in both broadcast and Pro AV. In Pro AV, however, there is a multitude of proprietary AV over IP solutions, none of which are open standards-based. This results in solutions with limited interoperability and triggers a frustrating situation for system designers and end customers alike who, although using off-the-shelf networking equipment, are still being locked into a proprietary endpoint solution. These closed standards are failing to deliver on the full promise of AV over IP.

Recent advances in deep learning, a subset of ML that utilizes multiple layers to extract more detail from content (e.g., the initial layer may detect the edges of an object up to understanding what that object is), have led to technology breakthroughs in areas of video processing utilizing ML. Some key technologies that are part of the advances in deep learning include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). CNNs are a class of deep neural network commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. Inputs to the network come from a set of image pixels, usually adjacent (such as a square or a rectangle of pixels). The inputs to the network are convolved (the input pixel area is shifted across the image) to generate abstracted versions of the image in higher layers of the network known as \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">activation maps</i>\n. RNNs use the output from previous experiences as inputs into different layers of the model and are uniquely suited to time series/temporal data (such as sequential video understanding activity detection). GANs contest two neural networks with each other in a game. A generative network generates candidates, while a discriminative network evaluates them. The generative network learns to map to a desired data distribution, while the discriminative network distinguishes the candidates produced by the generator as either part of the desired data distribution or not. The generative networks\u2019 training objective is to increase the error rate of the discriminative network, that is, to fool the discriminative network into believing that the generated candidates are real and are not synthesized. One GAN example is a network that creates realistic synthesized human faces that look so real that the discriminative network (or a person, for that matter) cannot tell that they are not real faces.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540056/","volume":"130","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/9540056/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Utilizing Machine Learning for Video Processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilizing Machine Learning for Video Processing","sourcePdf":"jmi-morrison-3101580-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053066S","chronDate":"Sept.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"7261654","isNumber":"9540011","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7261654","xplore-issue":"9540011","articleId":"9540056","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","_value":"SMPTE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":9540057,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre-Anthony Lemieux","bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7261654/9540011/9540057/lemie-3098382-small.gif","p":["Pierre-Anthony Lemieux is a partner at Sandflow Consulting, San Mateo, CA, where he works with both Hollywood and Silicon Valley clients on worldwide standards, proof-of-concept development, and product architecture.

Traditional industry is declining and intelligent industry is rising. Compared with the traditional industry, intelligent industry has a stronger demand for computing resources and is more sensitive to delay. To meet these requirements, this paper designs a computing platform integrating edge and cloud resources. The platform is mainly composed of edge computing nodes, cloud system, and AI(Artificial Intelligence) component. Edge computing nodes provide network services and computing offload services, which can quickly respond to industrial tasks. Cloud system provides computing resources and storage services for high resource consumption tasks in industry. AI components make full use of idle resources in the edge network to form clusters to accelerate AI inference. Facing different industrial scenarios, the platform can flexibly allocate computing resources in the network and provide computing offload service for tasks in the industry. Finally, we designed three experimental scenarios to verify the effectiveness of our platform. In the three experimental scenarios, compared with the traditional task execution method, our platform has brought obvious productivity improvement and accelerated the completion speed of the task.","doi":"10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540097","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9540064/9540047/09540097.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9540047","startPage":"212","endPage":"215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated Edge and Cloud Computing Platform for Multi-Industrial Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Edge and Cloud Computing Platform for Multi-Industrial Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 15 2021-Aug. 15 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540097/","conferenceDate":"15 July-15 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"15 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540097/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Edge and Cloud Computing Platform for Multi-Industrial Applications","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02985.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053103S","chronDate":"July 15 2021-Aug. 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9540064","isNumber":"9540047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9540064","xplore-issue":"9540047","articleId":"9540097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9540116,"authors":[{"name":"Yutong Wang","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yutong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088758926"},{"name":"Yansong Cao","affiliation":["Macau Institute of Systems Engineering Macau, University of Science and Technology, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Yansong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37088972167"},{"name":"Fei-Yue Wang","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei-Yue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088970994"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3337-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3338-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9540116","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Productivity","Costs","Digital twin","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Maintenance engineering","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["digital twin","anomaly detection","transmission system"]}],"abstract":"As the simulation model of a physical system, digital twin has been widely used in many complicated control systems. Providing an effective way to perform simulation, digital twin makes the evaluation, prediction and optimization process cheaper and easier than on physical systems. For smart manufacturing, digital twin achieves high productivity with less operation and maintenance cost. However, the advantages of digital twin in anomaly detection during manufacturing are always neglected. Taking a two-speed transmission system as an example, we generate three kinds of faults on this digital twin model. After extracting features from the system output, we train an anomaly detection model on these features to classify each type of fault. By this digital twin model, we can find the fault in the whole system at the very beginning, and reduce the time and cost of debugging and diagnosing.","doi":"10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540116","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9540064/9540047/09540116.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9540047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Digital Twin Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 15 2021-Aug. 15 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540116/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Digital Twin Model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"15 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540116/","conferenceDate":"15 July-15 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Digital Twin Model","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08079S","chronDate":"July 15 2021-Aug. 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9540064","isNumber":"9540047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9540064","xplore-issue":"9540047","articleId":"9540116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9540120,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyu Shen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tianyu","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086603738"},{"name":"Chao Gou","affiliation":["Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Gou","id":"37085404729"},{"name":"Jiangong Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiangong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088970843"},{"name":"Jun Huang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088970589"},{"name":"Yonglan He","affiliation":["Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yonglan","lastName":"He","id":"37088970560"},{"name":"Huadan Xue","affiliation":["Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huadan","lastName":"Xue","id":"37088969136"},{"name":"Zhengyu Jin","affiliation":["Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Jin","id":"37088971153"},{"name":"Fei-Yue Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei-Yue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085665928"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3337-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3338-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9540120","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Visualization","Image recognition","Annotations","Digital twin","Conferences","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ACP","parallel medical imaging","medical image recognition","small sample","domain knowledge"]}],"abstract":"The deep learning methods trained with large-scale manually annotated datasets have led to significant breakthroughs in medical image community.

Firstly, we present the basic framework and key techniques of PMI, in which the Artificial imaging systems are constructed to effectively augment the \u201cmedical small sample\u201d, the Computational experiments are carried out for designing and evaluating the visual models trained with small samples, and the Parallel execution is conducted to achieve closed-loop interaction and optimization in the domain-knowledge guidance. Furthermore, we illustrate a preliminary implementation and application of PMI approach through the case study of mammogram analysis.","doi":"10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540120","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9540064/9540047/09540120.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9540047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Medical Imaging: An ACP-Based Approach for Intelligent Medical Image Recognition with Small Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 15 2021-Aug. 15 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540120/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Medical Imaging: An ACP-Based Approach for Intelligent Medical Image Recognition with Small Samples","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"15 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540120/","conferenceDate":"15 July-15 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61533019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Medical Imaging: An ACP-Based Approach for Intelligent Medical Image Recognition with Small Samples","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130856S","chronDate":"July 15 2021-Aug. 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9540064","isNumber":"9540047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9540064","xplore-issue":"9540047","articleId":"9540120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9540134,"authors":[{"name":"Zehao Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Mobile Network and Mobile Multimedia Technology, ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, China","Wireless Product Research and Development Institute, ZTE Corporation, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zehao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37088970458"},{"name":"Xingzai Lv","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Mobile Network and Mobile Multimedia Technology, ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, China","Wireless Product Research and Development Institute, ZTE Corporation, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xingzai","lastName":"Lv","id":"37088972812"},{"name":"Hua Rui","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Mobile Network and Mobile Multimedia Technology, ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, China","Wireless Product Research and Development Institute, ZTE Corporation, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Rui","id":"37088968623"},{"name":"Wei Lin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Mobile Network and Mobile Multimedia Technology, ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, China","Wireless Product Research and Development Institute, ZTE Corporation, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37088972468"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3337-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3338-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9540134","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"abstract":"Digital twin channel modeling is the core and the most challenging part of the digital twin communication systems, due to the complex and susceptible nature of the wireless channel. However, existing channel models are inadequate in capturing the characteristics of real-world channels where the user equipments (UEs) are moving. In this paper, we solve this problem by developing a data-driven continuous trajectory modeling, which requires only a limited number of channel measurements to generate continuous channel coefficients for arbitrary UE tracks. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) building a data-driven model which captures the spatial correlation of the wireless channel based on scenario-specific channel measurements, and (2) constructing a trajectory model which models the temporal correlation of channel parameters when the UE is moving. Simulation results show that the proposed modeling process generates channel models whose spatial and temporal characteristics well match the real-world wireless channels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Data-driven modeling","Correlation","Digital twin","Simulation","Conferences","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network planning","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital twin channel","data-driven continuous trajectory modeling","digital twin communication systems","wireless channel","real-world channels","continuous channel","data-driven model","scenario-specific channel measurements","trajectory model","channel parameters","modeling process","user equipments","arbitrary UE tracks","real-world wireless channels","temporal characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital twins","Data-driven","Channel modeling","Trajectory modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540134","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9540064/9540047/09540134.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9540047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Twin Channel: A Data-Driven Continuous Trajectory Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital Twin Channel: A Data-Driven Continuous Trajectory Modeling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540134/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"15 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540134/","accessionNumber":"21231151","conferenceDate":"15 July-15 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 15 2021-Aug. 15 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Twin Channel: A Data-Driven Continuous Trajectory Modeling","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070766S","chronDate":"July 15 2021-Aug. 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9540064","isNumber":"9540047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9540064","xplore-issue":"9540047","articleId":"9540134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9540165,"authors":[{"name":"Kan Yi","affiliation":["Science and Technology on, Information System Engineering Laboratory, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kan","lastName":"Yi","id":"37088971700"},{"name":"Xuesong Li","affiliation":["Science and Technology on, Information System Engineering Laboratory, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xuesong","lastName":"Li","id":"37088972285"},{"name":"Zijuan Luo","affiliation":["Science and Technology on, Information System Engineering Laboratory, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zijuan","lastName":"Luo","id":"37088971332"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3337-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3338-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9540165","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Image recognition","Digital twin","Generative adversarial networks","Radar polarimetry","Robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAR image recognition","parallel vision","generative adversarial network"]}],"abstract":"In order to solve the problems of insufficient SAR data and difficulty in labeling in SAR image recognition task, this paper proposes a SAR image recognition method based on parallel vision.

Spatial Sampling and Aggregating Graph Neural Network for Crowd Flow Forecasting","abstract":"With the development of traffic demand management, crowd flow forecasting arouse increasing interest. In order to tackle this spatial-temporal prediction problem, GNN (Graph Neural Networks) have been recently employed to model spatial dependencies, and usually spatial graphs are constructed based on geodetic distances or direct connections between nodes. However, it might be insufficient for spatial graphs to model real dependencies because they neglect spatial-temporal correlations. In this paper, a novel Temporal-Difference Spatial Sampling and Aggregating graph neural network (TDSSA) is proposed to model spatial-temporal dependencies. Firstly, a new sub-sparse spatial-temporal graph is constructed to represent spatial-temporal relationships among different nodes, then a TDSSA block is designed to extract features by spatial sampling and aggregating, and difference is utilized in TDSSA blocks to exploit temporal trend and increase robustness. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 15 2021-Aug. 15 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540169/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9540169/","publicationDate":"15 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2021","conferenceDate":"15 July-15 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Temporal-Difference Spatial Sampling and Aggregating Graph Neural Network for Crowd Flow Forecasting","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB2104001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal-Difference Spatial Sampling and Aggregating Graph Neural Network for Crowd Flow Forecasting","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092406S","chronDate":"July 15 2021-Aug. 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9540064","isNumber":"9540047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9540064","xplore-issue":"9540047","articleId":"9540169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9540177,"authors":[{"name":"Yanhong Zhu","affiliation":["China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanhong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37088598069"},{"name":"Danyang Chen","affiliation":["China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Danyang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088969124"},{"name":"Cheng Zhou","affiliation":["China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37088970697"},{"name":"Lu Lu","affiliation":["China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37088597445"},{"name":"Xiaodong Duan","affiliation":["China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Duan","id":"37088394065"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3337-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3338-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9540177","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"With the advent of the digital age, digital twin as a new potential technology has received much attention from both academia and industry increasingly.

The problem of coil misalignment between the primary and secondary coils are considered, and the time varying coupling coefficient are described in a sojourn-probability-based switch model. A set of random variables are utilized to describe the sojourn probabilities of the finite modes of the coil misalignment. It should be pointed out that the sojourn probability of the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$i$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\nth subsystem is obtained by the off-line statistical test instead of prescribed by hand, which is of more closer physical significance due to its engineering practice. Corresponding to the proposed switching systems, a set of controllers with time-varying delays are constructed. By resorting to the Lyapunov stability theory, the matrix analysis, and the stochastic analysis tools, the delay-dependent sufficient criteria with less conservatism are derived to guarantee the mean square stability of the ICPT system and the given interference attenuation level \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gamma $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n.

However, due to the use of a large overcomplete dictionary obtained from a predefined grid, CS-based DOA estimation methods normally suffer from high computational complexity and the grid mismatch problem. Many methods, in particular sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) based off-grid methods, have been developed to address the grid mismatch problem at the cost of high complexity. In this work, we develop a new method for DOA estimation based on marginal likelihood maximization, where the array manifold matrix is learned incrementally, which is in contrast to the use of overcomplete dictionaries or grid matrices in existing CS or SBL based methods. We show that the problem of marginal likelihood maximization over multiple variables can be greatly simplified to maximization of a simple cost function over a sole variable (angle), which enables the learning of the manifold matrix and the development of an efficient solver. The grid mismatch problem is circumvented and the manifold matrix during learning is kept in a small size (slightly larger than the number of sources), leading to low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the merits of the proposed method in terms of performance and computational complexity, compared to state-of-the-art SBL-based methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3112922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09540245.pdf","startPage":"5512","endPage":"5522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3112922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Marginal Likelihood Maximization Based Fast Array Manifold Matrix Learning for Direction of Arrival Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540245/","displayDocTitle":"Marginal Likelihood Maximization Based Fast Array Manifold Matrix Learning for Direction of Arrival Estimation","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9540245/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UOW"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Marginal Likelihood Maximization Based Fast Array Manifold Matrix Learning for Direction of Arrival Estimation","sourcePdf":"tsp-guo-3112922-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091679S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9540245","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9540246,"authors":[{"name":"Yohan Petetin","affiliation":["Samovar, Telecom SudParis, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Yohan","lastName":"Petetin","orcid":"0000-0001-9200-783X","id":"38474722600"},{"name":"Yazid Janati","affiliation":["Samovar, Telecom SudParis, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Yazid","lastName":"Janati","id":"37088988900"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Desbouvries","affiliation":["Samovar, Telecom SudParis, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Desbouvries","id":"37350831000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9540246","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Linear and Gaussian models with regime switching are popular in signal processing. In this letter, we revisit Bayesian inference in such models under the variational Bayesian framework. We propose a structured but implicit variational distribution which can be seen as the posterior distribution of an alternative statistical model in which the first and second order moments of the filtering distribution can be computed exactly. A critical property of this alternative model is that the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between its associated posterior distribution and that of linear and Gaussian models with regime switching can also be computed exactly, at a cost linear in the number of observations; hence, we propose a parameter estimation method of our variational model but also of the original one from a sequence of observations. Once the parameters are estimated, our inference method is efficient as compared to the Rao-Blackwell Particle Filter.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540246","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Bayes methods","Markov processes","Switches","Reactive power","Parameter estimation","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Variational inference","jump Markov state space models","parameter estimation"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09540246.pdf","startPage":"1953","endPage":"1957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3113279","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3113279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured Variational Bayesian Inference for Gaussian State-Space Models With Regime Switching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540246/","displayDocTitle":"Structured Variational Bayesian Inference for Gaussian State-Space Models With Regime Switching","isDynamicHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540246/","volume":"28","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured Variational Bayesian Inference for Gaussian State-Space Models With Regime Switching","sourcePdf":"lsp-petetin-3113279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100667S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9540246","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9540251,"authors":[{"name":"Liwei Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/9632664/9540251/zhou-3113171-small.gif","p":["Liwei Zhou (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2014 and 2017, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

A specific filter gain is proposed by solving the equality constrained optimization problem so that the attack on the actuator does not affect the a posteriori estimation error of the system. A new method to construct X2 detection variables is proposed, which does not require that the covariance matrix be invertible, and then the actuator and sensor attack detection schemes are developed, respectively. Based on the detection results, a multiple information fusion algorithm is developed and an estimator based controller with the compensator, which can compensate for the actuator attack in previous step, is further designed. A necessary and sufficient condition for complete compensation is provided, and the stability of the filter and the control system is proved.

In particular, we demonstrate that avalanche photodetectors based on silicon-germanium-silicon heterostructures yield reliable opto-electrical performances, with high gain-bandwidth products up to 480 GHz and low effective ionization ratios down to 0.15. Moreover, they improve power sensitivities for high-speed optical signals and have a low energy dissipation of only a few fJ per received information bit.

The attack objective is to corrupt the least numbers of sensors so that the state estimate error approaches to a target bias while avoiding being detected and a high attacking lost. First, with precise knowledge of measurement model and applying a sparsity projection operation with average linear complexity rather than the popular brute force search and approximation techniques, a distributed optimization scheme is proposed which provides to an exact and low-complexity algorithmic solution to finding the optimal attack strategy. Furthermore, by introducing dead-zone type projection and region projection operators, a distributed optimization algorithm for robust sparse undetectable attacks is proposed with imprecise model knowledge. A distinguishing point of the proposed algorithms is that a trade-off between computational complexity and attacks impact can be achieved by properly designing a cost function. Simulation results on an unmanned ground vehicle are presented to substantiate the algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540263/","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Sparse Undetectable Attacks Against State Estimation","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Sparse Undetectable Attacks Against State Estimation","sourcePdf":"tcns-3112774-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046455S","isNumber":"6730648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6509490","articleId":"9540263","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":9540268,"authors":[{"name":"Bingzhao Zhu","affiliation":["Applied Physics, Cornell University, 5922 Ithaca, New York, United States, 14853-0001 (e-mail: bz323@cornell.edu)"],"firstName":"Bingzhao","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Uisub Shin","affiliation":["Cornell University, 5922 Ithaca, New York, United States, (e-mail: us52@cornell.edu)"],"firstName":"Uisub","lastName":"Shin"},{"name":"Mahsa Shoaran","affiliation":["IEL, EPFL STI, 111838 Geneva, Switzerland, 1202 (e-mail: mahsa.shoaran@epfl.ch)"],"firstName":"Mahsa","lastName":"Shoaran"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-4545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1940-9990"}],"articleNumber":"9540268","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540268","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prosthetics","Electroencephalography","Electrodes","System-on-chip","Machine learning","Biomarkers","Epilepsy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural prostheses","closed-loop neuromodulation","on-chip machine learning","symptom detection","decision trees"]}],"abstract":"The application of closed-loop approaches in systems neuroscience and therapeutic stimulation holds great promise for revolutionizing our understanding of the brain and for developing novel neuromodulation therapies to restore lost functions. Neural prostheses capable of multi-channel neural recording, on-site signal processing, rapid symptom detection, and closed-loop stimulation are critical to enabling such novel treatments. However, the existing closed-loop neuromodulation devices are too simplistic and lack sufficient on-chip processing and intelligence. In this paper, we first discuss both commercial and investigational closed-loop neuromodulation devices for brain disorders. Next, we review state-of-the-art neural prostheses with on-chip machine learning (ML), focusing on application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC). System requirements, performance and hardware comparisons, design trade-offs, and hardware optimization techniques are discussed. To facilitate a fair comparison and guide design choices among various on-chip classifiers, we propose a new energy-area (E-A) efficiency figure of merit that evaluates hardware efficiency and multi-channel scalability. Finally, we present several techniques to improve the key design metrics of tree-based on-chip classifiers, both in the context of ensemble methods and oblique structures. A novel Depth-Variant Tree Ensemble (DVTE) is proposed to reduce processing latency (e.g., by 2.5\n<formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex>$\\times$</tex></formula>\n on seizure detection task). We further developed a cost-aware learning approach to jointly optimize the power and latency metrics. We show that algorithm-hardware co-design enables the energy- and memory-optimized design of tree-based models, while preserving a high accuracy and low latency. Furthermore, we show that our proposed tree-based models feature a highly interpretable decision process that is essential for safety-critical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2021.3112756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/4358093/09540268.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2021.3112756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4358093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-Loop Neural Prostheses with On-Chip Intelligence: A Review and A Low-Latency Machine Learning Model for Brain State Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Loop Neural Prostheses with On-Chip Intelligence: A Review and A Low-Latency Machine Learning Model for Brain State Detection","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"34529573","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000025","fundingName":"National Institute of Mental Health","grantNumber":"R01-MH-123634"}]},"earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Loop Neural Prostheses with On-Chip Intelligence: A Review and A Low-Latency Machine Learning Model for Brain State Detection","sourcePdf":"tbcas-3112756-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04135S","isNumber":"4358093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","articleId":"9540268","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":9540272,"authors":[{"name":"Weisheng Li","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Image Cognition, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/9314330/9540272/li-3113163-small.gif","p":["Weisheng Li received his B.S. degree in industrial automation and the M.S. degree in mechanical manufacturing and automation from the School of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from the School of Computer Science and Technology Xidian University, in 2004.","He is currently a Professor with the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, and the Director of the Chongqing Key Laboratory of Image Cognition, Chongqing, China.

However, it is difficult for a single satellite to obtain such images due to technical and cost constraints. Therefore, spatiotemporal image fusion based on deep learning has received extensive attention in recent years. This article proposes a multicooperative deep convolutional neural network (MCDNet) for spatiotemporal satellite image fusion. This method is a new multinetwork model in which multiple networks work together to reconstruct the predicted image. The multinetwork model consists of a super-resolution network, a difference reconstruction network, and a collaborative training network. First, the super-resolution network uses the combination of a novel multiscale mechanism and dilated convolutions to make full use of the spectral information of the coarse image and upgrade it to a transitional image that matches the fine image. The difference reconstruction network uses structural relevance to complete the reconstruction of the fine difference image. The collaborative training network extracts the hidden information from the fine image and uses the time relevance to restrict the training of the difference reconstruction network. Finally, the fine difference image and the known fine image are combined to complete the image fusion. The new compound loss function can help multinetwork models better complete cooperative training. Through experiments on two datasets and comparison with existing fusion algorithms, the subjective and objective results prove that MCDNet can effectively reconstruct higher-quality prediction images.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3113163","startPage":"10174","endPage":"10188","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/9314330/09540272.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3113163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9314330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Cooperative Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Fusion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Convolutional neural networks","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Spatial resolution","Feature extraction","Satellites","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","deep learning (artificial intelligence)","feature extraction","image fusion","image reconstruction","image resolution","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicooperative deep convolutional neural network","spatiotemporal satellite image fusion","remote sensing satellite images","temporal resolution","spatial resolution","deep learning","super-resolution network","difference reconstruction network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network (CNN)","dilated convolution","multiscale mechanism","spatiotemporal fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Cooperative Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Fusion","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/9540272/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21176391","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61972060, U1713213 and 62027827"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2019YFE0110800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005230","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2020jcyj-zdxmX0025 and cstc2019cxcyljrc-td0270"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Multi-Cooperative Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Fusion","sourcePdf":"jstars-yang-3113163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1057S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","articleId":"9540272","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9540292,"authors":[{"name":"Lifu Liu","affiliation":["5G Innovation Centre and 6G Innovation Centre, Institute for Communication Systems, University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9540292/liu-3112927-small.gif","p":["Lifu Liu (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China and the M.S. degree in wireless communications from the University of Surrey, U.K. He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering with the Institute for Communication Systems, University of Surrey, U.K. His main research interests include millimeter-wave communications and massive multiple-input multiple-output."]},"firstName":"Lifu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086563421"},{"name":"Yi Ma","affiliation":["5G Innovation Centre and 6G Innovation Centre, Institute for Communication Systems, University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9540292/ma-3112927-small.gif","p":["Yi Ma (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and electronics from the University of Liverpool, U.K., in 2004.

Instead, the quantization distortion is characterized by the second-order Hermite kernel, and the signal term is characterized by the first-order Hermite kernel. It is shown that the SOHE model can explain almost all phenomena and characteristics observed so far in the low-resolution MIMO signal reception. When the SOHE model is employed to analyze the linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) channel equalizer, it is revealed that the current LMMSE algorithm can be enhanced by incorporating a symbol-level normalization mechanism. The performance of the enhanced LMMSE algorithm is demonstrated through computer simulations for narrowband MIMO systems in Rayleigh fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3112927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09540292.pdf","startPage":"5313","endPage":"5328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3112927","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hermite Expansion Model and LMMSE Analysis for Low-Resolution Quantized MIMO Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hermite Expansion Model and LMMSE Analysis for Low-Resolution Quantized MIMO Detection","volume":"69","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540292/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingName":"Horizon 2020 5G-Drive project","grantNumber":"ICT-814956"},{"fundingName":"5G Innovation Centre"},{"fundingName":"6G Innovation Centre"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hermite Expansion Model and LMMSE Analysis for Low-Resolution Quantized MIMO Detection","sourcePdf":"tsp-ma-3112927-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118501S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9540292","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9540305,"authors":[{"name":"Shuqiao Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuqiao","lastName":"Sun","orcid":"0000-0002-5420-9745"},{"name":"Rongke Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongke","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-3098-8649"},{"name":"Shantong Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shantong","lastName":"Sun","orcid":"0000-0001-8621-7072"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9540305","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Estimation","Training","Three-dimensional displays","Geometry","Sun","Distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stereo matching","depth map","scene reconstruction","neural networks","surface normal"]}],"abstract":"Depth map plays an important role in our daily life including automatic driving, intelligent robots, and commercial manufacture. However, existing depth estimation methods are still facing some difficulties in real-life applications. Firstly, using merely point-wise metrics during training usually causes surface distortion due to the lack of geometric restrictions. To tackle this problem, we introduce a normal restriction module to the network to improve the method performance with regards to surface integrity. Secondly, although 3D methods usually achieve higher accuracy by directly concatenating features as cost aggregation, they sacrifice the time and memory efficiency. To make the disparity estimation network light enough for adding the normal restriction, we propose a 2D aggregation method to replace the 3D ones. Experiments prove the effectiveness of our method and we show that our results are competitive to 3D methods under popular benchmarks including KITTI, SceneFlow and Midddlebury.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DESA: Disparity Estimation With Surface Awareness","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3113278","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09540305.pdf","startPage":"2028","endPage":"2032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3113278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"DESA: Disparity Estimation With Surface Awareness","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9540305/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DESA: Disparity Estimation With Surface Awareness","sourcePdf":"lsp-liu-3113278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112438S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9540305","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9540330,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiming Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9540330/guo-3112914-small.gif","p":["Ruiming Guo received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 2017 and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, HKSAR, China, in 2021.

Two recursive least-square estimators update runtime an accurate non parametric model. Compared to previous parameter-free solutions, the proposed algorithm can achieve a significantly lower current harmonic distortion at the same control frequency, while keeping the switching frequency value at bay. The result is an efficient and smooth torque delivery. The paper gives the necessary design hints and analyses the steady state performance in terms of both current harmonic distortion and switching frequency, taking finite-set model-based and parameter-free schemes as benchmark. This analysis was previously missing in literature for parameter-free schemes.

In this new framework, we model input data as unknown linear transformations of some latent vectors drawn from a polytope. In this sense, the article considers a semi-structured data model, in which the input matrix is modeled as the product of a full column rank matrix and a matrix containing samples from a polytope as its column vectors. The choice of polytope reflects the presumed features of the latent components and their mutual relationships. As the factorization criterion, we propose the determinant maximization (Det-Max) for the sample autocorrelation matrix of the latent vectors. We introduce a sufficient condition for identifiability, which requires that the convex hull of the latent vectors contains the maximum volume inscribed ellipsoid of the polytope with a particular tightness constraint. Based on the Det-Max criterion and the proposed identifiability condition, we show that all polytopes that satisfy a particular symmetry restriction qualify for the PMF framework. Having infinitely many polytope choices provides a form of flexibility in characterizing latent vectors. In particular, it is possible to define latent vectors with heterogeneous features, enabling the assignment of attributes such as nonnegativity and sparsity at the subvector level. The article offers examples illustrating the connection between polytope choices and the corresponding feature representations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3112918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09540353.pdf","startPage":"5431","endPage":"5447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3112918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polytopic Matrix Factorization: Determinant Maximization Based Criterion and Identifiability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Polytopic Matrix Factorization: Determinant Maximization Based Criterion and Identifiability","volume":"69","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540353/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"AI Fellowship"},{"fundingName":"KUIS AI Lab"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polytopic Matrix Factorization: Determinant Maximization Based Criterion and Identifiability","sourcePdf":"tsp-erdogan-3112918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128401S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9540353","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9540355,"authors":[{"name":"Bilal Ahmad","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, 126176 Aalto, Finland, (e-mail: bilal.3.ahmad@aalto.fi)"],"firstName":"Bilal","lastName":"Ahmad"},{"name":"Prasad Jayathurathnage","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, 126176 Espoo, Finland, (e-mail: prasad.jayathurathnage@aalto.fi)"],"firstName":"Prasad","lastName":"Jayathurathnage"},{"name":"Wilmar Martinez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), KU Leuven, 26657 Leuven, Flanders, Belgium, (e-mail: wilmar.martinez@kuleuven.be)"],"firstName":"Wilmar","lastName":"Martinez"},{"name":"Jorma Kyyra","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, 126176 Espoo, Finland, (e-mail: jorma.kyyra@aalto.fi)"],"firstName":"Jorma","lastName":"Kyyra"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2687-9735"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2687-9743"}],"articleNumber":"9540355","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540355","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Inductors","Frequency measurement","Electromagnetic interference","Capacitance measurement","Analytical models","Inductance measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High Frequency Modelling","Three-winding magnetic components","Wide Band Gap (WBG) Semiconductors","Gallium Nitride (GaN)","Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI)","High Step-Up Converter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JESTIE.2021.3112929","endPage":"1","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8847244/9107390/09540355.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTIE.2021.3112929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9107390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter Extraction Technique for Evaluation of Inductive and Capacitive Elements of Three-Winding Coupled Inductor","abstract":"Wide band gap devices have enabled miniaturization of magnetic components to enhance the power density of the converter. However, parasitic components become dominant at higher switching frequencies that actuate unwanted electromagnetic interference issues. Therefore, it is critical to model and evaluate them in compact magnetic structures. Since multiwinding coupled inductive structures are essential part of multiphase converters, this paper introduces a measurement method to compute the parasitic elements of a three-winding coupled inductor. Results of the proposed method are verified by measuring the high-frequency emissions of the high step-up converter with two inductor structures. Both inductors had similar inductances but different physical dimensions. With application of the proposed measurement methodology, parasitic capacitances of both inductors were computed. Results showed that one inductor structure has higher parasitic capacitance than the other. Since, high-frequency emissions of the converter directly depends on the parasitic capacitance of the inductor structure, emission profile of the converter showed that converter indeed had lower noise peaks when inductor with lower capacitance was employed. Hence, these results validate the capacitance trend as predicted by the proposed modeling technique. This method can be employed to any multiwinding coupled inductor to compute its parasitics to optimize the required EMI filters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540355/","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isOpenAccess":true,"isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Parameter Extraction Technique for Evaluation of Inductive and Capacitive Elements of Three-Winding Coupled Inductor","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Parameter Extraction Technique for Evaluation of Inductive and Capacitive Elements of Three-Winding Coupled Inductor","sourcePdf":"jestie-3112929-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020239S","isNumber":"9107390","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8847244","articleId":"9540355","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":9540363,"authors":[{"name":"Said El-Khamy","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Alexandria University Faculty of Engineering, 110137 Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt, (e-mail: said.elkhamy@alexu.edu.eg)"],"firstName":"Said","lastName":"El-Khamy"},{"name":"Hassan M Elragal","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Alexandria University Faculty of Engineering, 110137 Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt, (e-mail: helragal@alexu.edu.eg)"],"firstName":"Hassan M","lastName":"Elragal"},{"name":"Remon Polus","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Alexandria University Faculty of Engineering, 110137 Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt, (e-mail: es-remon.adly1116@alexu.edu.eg)"],"firstName":"Remon","lastName":"Polus"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2644-1330"}],"articleNumber":"9540363","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540363","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Modulation","Indexes","NOMA","Fading channels","Transmitters","Downlink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","Index Modulation","Millimeter Waves","Multiple-Access","NOMA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose two new multiple-access schemes for downlink system based on the combination of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with index modulation (IM), namely OFDM-IM.

On the other hand, in the second proposed scheme, an extended version of IMMA is introduced where the different users are arranged into different pairs, and each pair of users shares a block of OFDM subcarriers. The two users of each pair are allocated into different domains: the index domain and the constellation domain. The focus in this paper is on the 28 GHz transmission band as it has been considered for an initial deployment of mm-waves wireless systems, due to their relatively lower location within the mmwaves range and are hence characterized by lower attenuation. The fluctuating two ray model (FTR) was proposed as the propagation model for 28 GHz outdoor millimeter waves channels. Simulation results demonstrate that both schemes achieve improved average bit error rate (ABER) than classical OFDMA and NOMA-IM techniques.","doi":"10.1109/OJVT.2021.3112942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782711/8889399/09540363.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJVT.2021.3112942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8889399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Index Modulation Multiple-Access (IMMA): Efficient Techniques for Downlink Millimeter Waves Outdoor Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540363/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Index Modulation Multiple-Access (IMMA): Efficient Techniques for Downlink Millimeter Waves Outdoor Channel","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Index Modulation Multiple-Access (IMMA): Efficient Techniques for Downlink Millimeter Waves Outdoor Channel","sourcePdf":"ojvt-3112942-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026131S","isNumber":"8889399","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782711","articleId":"9540363","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":9540365,"authors":[{"name":"Woongsup Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Institute of Marine Industry, Gyeongsang National University, Tongyeong, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Woongsup","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0002-9431-7804","id":"37536663200"},{"name":"Kisong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Jung-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Kisong","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0001-8206-4558","id":"37717285200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"9540365","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540365","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Device-to-device communication","Quality of service","Optimization","Interference","Channel estimation","Resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network","imperfect channel state information","robust power control","underlay D2D"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a robust transmit power control scheme is proposed for multi-channel underlay device-to-device (D2D) communications with imperfect channel state information (CSI).

To this end, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) structure and training methodology, in which artificially distorted CSI is used to compensate for the effect of imperfect CSI, such that a robust transmit power control strategy against channel error can be derived.

Since a WPT system operates at high frequency, Litz wire typically is used that can overcome high AC resistance, and improve overall efficiency. In EV wireless charging applications, the power level of the system is high, and therefore the magnetic pad size and copper cross-section of the Litz wire used in the magnetic couplers are large which increases the cost and weight. Besides, building the magnetic couplers using Litz wire requires excessive labor work, which causes fabrication errors. Replacing the Litz wire with PCB-based coils raises design and efficiency challenges. A new approach for designing the PCB-based magnetic couplers for high-power EV wireless charging applications is proposed to address the challenges associated with the PCB designs. In the proposed design, the efficiency of the PCB-based design is close to the Litz wire-based design. Moreover, machine assembly replaces the labor work and the magnetic coupler can be implemented with lower fabrication error, weight, and manufacturing cost. In this paper, a 3.3kW PCB-based WPT system is designed, compared experimentally with the Litz wire setup which achieved a competitive efficiency profile.","doi":"10.1109/OJVT.2021.3112687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782711/8889399/09540369.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJVT.2021.3112687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8889399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient PCB Based Magnetic Coupler Design for Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540369/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient PCB Based Magnetic Coupler Design for Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Efficient PCB Based Magnetic Coupler Design for Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging","sourcePdf":"ojvt-3112687-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017982S","isNumber":"8889399","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782711","articleId":"9540369","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":9540373,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["School of Geosciences and Info-Physics, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/9314330/9540373/lchen-3113047-small.gif","p":["Li Chen received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree in software engineering from School of Software, Central South University, China, in 2015 and 2018 respectively.

It has three problems: 1) The difficulty of classifying point clouds around boundaries of objects from different classes, 2) the diversity of shapes within the same class, and 3) the scale differences between classes. In this study, we propose a novel double self-attention convolutional network called the DAPnet. The double self-attention includes the point attention module (PAM) and the group attention module (GAM). For problem 1), the PAM can effectively assign different weights based on the relevance of point clouds in adjacent areas. Meanwhile, for problem 2), the GAM enhances the correlation between groups, i.e., grouped features within the same classes. To solve problem 3), we adopt a multiscale radius to construct the groups and concatenate extracted hierarchical features with the output of the corresponding upsampling process. Under the ISPRS 3D Semantic Labeling Contest dataset, the DAPnet outperforms the benchmark by 85.2% with an overall accuracy of 90.7%. By conducting ablation comparisons, we find that the PAM effectively improves the model than the GAM. The incorporation of the double self-attention module has an average of 7% improvement on the pre-class accuracy. Plus, the DAPnet consumes a similar training time to those without the attention modules for model convergence. The DAPnet can assign different weights to features based on the relevance between point clouds and their neighbors, which effectively improves classification performance.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3113047","startPage":"9680","endPage":"9691","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/9314330/09540373.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3113047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9314330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DAPnet: A Double Self-Attention Convolutional Network for Point Cloud Semantic Labeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Semantics","Labeling","Shape","Training","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","convolutional neural nets","feature extraction","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DAPnet","PAM","GAM","pre-class accuracy","airborne laser scanning point clouds","scale differences","double self-attention convolutional network","point attention module","group attention module","point cloud semantic labeling","ISPRS 3D semantic labeling contest dataset","ALS","complex structures","multiscale radius","hierarchical feature extraction","upsampling process","model convergence","classification performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds","convolutional neural network (CNN)","self-attention","semantic labeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"DAPnet: A Double Self-Attention Convolutional Network for Point Cloud Semantic Labeling","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/9540373/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21126781","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41871364, 61773360, 41861048, 41871276 and 41871302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"DAPnet: A Double Self-Attention Convolutional Network for Point Cloud Semantic Labeling","sourcePdf":"jstars-li-3113047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110654S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","articleId":"9540373","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9540376,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungtae Lee","affiliation":["Intelligent perception branch, Army Research Laboratory, Adalphi, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/9314330/9540376/lee-3112924-small.gif","p":["Hyungtae Lee (Member, IEEE) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2006, the master\u2019s degree from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, in 2014.","He was at Booz Allen Hamilton Inc and US Army Research Lab from 2014 to 2021.

Few fully annotated large-scale datasets for pixel-wise classification exist due to the challenges of annotating individual pixels. Training data scarcity inevitably ensues from the annotation challenge, leading to overfitting classifiers and degraded classification performance. The lack of annotated pixels also necessarily results in few hard examples of various entities critical for generating a robust classification hyperplane. To overcome the problem of the data scarcity and lack of hard examples in training, we introduce a two-step hard example generation (HEG) approach that first generates hard example candidates and then mines actual hard examples. In the first step, a generator that creates hard example candidates is learned via the adversarial learning framework by fooling a discriminator and a pixel-wise classification model at the same time. In the second step, mining is performed to build a fixed number of hard examples from a large pool of real and artificially generated examples. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HEG approach, we design a nine-layer fully convolutional network suitable for pixel-wise classification. Experiments show that using generated hard examples from the proposed HEG approach improves the pixel-wise classification model\u2019s accuracy on red tide detection and hyperspectral image classification tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540376/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21101704","volume":"14","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generating Hard Examples for Pixel-Wise Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Development of the integrated data processing system for GOCI-II"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Ocean and Fisheries, Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Generating Hard Examples for Pixel-Wise Classification","sourcePdf":"jstars-lee-3112924-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142063S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","articleId":"9540376","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9540377,"authors":[{"name":"Jabrane Karkouri","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, INSA Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UJM-Saint-Etienne CNRS, Inserm, CREATIS UMR 5220, U1294, LYON, France","Siemens Healthineers, Saint-Denis, France","Wolfson Brain Imaging Center, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K."],"firstName":"Jabrane","lastName":"Karkouri","id":"37087210834"},{"name":"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Ratiney","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de Radiologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne Cedex 2"],"firstName":"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","lastName":"Ratiney","orcid":"0000-0002-0662-2172","id":"37871661200"},{"name":"Magalie Viallon","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de Radiologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne Cedex 2"],"firstName":"Magalie","lastName":"Viallon","id":"38228934500"},{"name":"R\u00e9my Prost","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de Radiologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne Cedex 2"],"firstName":"R\u00e9my","lastName":"Prost","orcid":"0000-0001-6972-5905","id":"37299944500"},{"name":"Fabien Millioz","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de Radiologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne Cedex 2"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Millioz","orcid":"0000-0001-9032-409X","id":"37712282600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9540377","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Sparse matrices","Imaging","Magnetic resonance","Sensor placement","Radar imaging","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Irregular sampling","undersampling","sample selection","sensor placement","least-square","magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging","spiral spectroscopic imaging"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with acceleration of multidimensional signal acquisition.

In particular, millimeter wave (mmWave) networks using a massive number of antennas and large bandwidth are considered for high-rate communication and high-accuracy localization. In mmWave networks, beamforming (BF) and power allocation need to be jointly designed to simultaneously achieve high data rates and high localization accuracies. This paper proposes cooperative BF and power allocation scheme with multiple base stations to maximize the weighted sum rate of mobile stations while guaranteeing position and orientation estimation error bounds. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In the first stage, pilot overhead is minimized while satisfying the accuracy constraints. In the second stage, the weighted sum rate for data transmission is maximized based on the estimated channel information. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves a larger rate-accuracy region compared to conventional schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5418892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/5418892/09540385.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3113115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3113115","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Communication and Localization in Millimeter Wave Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540385/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Communication and Localization in Millimeter Wave Networks","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Communication and Localization in Millimeter Wave Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-3113115-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03739S","isNumber":"5418892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","articleId":"9540385","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":9540594,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Tung Chou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9540594/chou-3113377-small.gif","p":["Chun Tung Chou (Member, IEEE) received the B.A. degree in engineering science from the University of Oxford, U.K., and the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from the University of Cambridge, U.K. He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Australia.

This paper considers the problem of using biochemical circuits to distinguish persistent signals from transient ones. We define a statistical detection problem over a reaction pathway consisting of three species: an inducer, a transcription factor (TF) and a gene promoter, where the inducer can activate the TF and an active TF can bind to the gene promoter. We model the pathway using the chemical master equation so the counts of bound promoters over time is a stochastic signal. We consider the problem of using the continuous-time stochastic signal of the counts of bound promoters to infer whether the inducer signal is persistent or not. We use statistical detection theory to derive the solution to this detection problem, which is to compute the log-likelihood ratio of observing a persistent signal to a transient one. We then show, using time-scale separation and other assumptions, that this log-likelihood ratio can be approximately computed by using the continuous-time signals of the number of active TF molecules and the number of bound promoters when the input is persistent. Finally, we show that the coherent feedforward gene circuits can be used to approximately compute this log-likelihood ratio when the inducer signal is persistent.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113377","startPage":"128996","endPage":"129010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09540594.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Biochemical Circuits to Approximately Compute Log-Likelihood Ratio for Detecting Persistent Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Using Biochemical Circuits to Approximately Compute Log-Likelihood Ratio for Detecting Persistent Signals","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540594/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Using Biochemical Circuits to Approximately Compute Log-Likelihood Ratio for Detecting Persistent Signals","sourcePdf":"access-chou-3113377-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162353S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540594","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":9540596,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Hoffmann","affiliation":["Institute of Radiocommunications, Pozna\u0144 University of Technology, Polanka, Pozna\u00f1, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9540596/hoffm-3113461-small.gif","p":["Marcin Hoffmann (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) in electronics and telecommunication from Pozna\u0144 University of Technology, in 2019, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute of Radiocommunications.

However, additional antennas require the installation of dedicated hardware. As a result the power consumption of a 5G MMIMO network grows. This implies, e.g., higher operator costs. From this angle, the improvement of Energy Efficiency (EE) is identified as one of the key challenges for the 5G and beyond networks. EE can be improved through intelligent antenna switching, i.e., disabling some of the antennas installed at a 5G MMIMO Base Station (BS) when there are few User Equipments (UEs) within the cell area. To improve EE in this scenario we propose to utilize a sub-class of Machine Learning techniques named Reinforcement Learning (RL). Because 5G and beyond networks are expected to come with accurate UE localization, the proposed RL algorithm is based on UE location information stored in an intelligent database named a Radio Environment Map (REM). Two approaches are proposed: first EE is maximized independently for every set of UEs\u2019 positions. After that the process of learning is accelerated by exploiting similarities between data in REM, i.e., REM-Empowered Action Selection Algorithm (REASA) is proposed. The proposed RL algorithms are evaluated with the use of a realistic simulator of the 5G MMIMO network utilizing an accurate 3D-Ray-Tracing radio channel model. The utilization of RL provides about 18.5% EE gains over algorithms based on standard optimization methods. Moreover, when REASA is used the process of learning can be accomplished approximately two times faster.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient 5G Massive MIMO: Intelligent Antenna Switching","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113461","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09540596.pdf","startPage":"130329","endPage":"130339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient 5G Massive MIMO: Intelligent Antenna Switching","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9540596/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004569","fundingName":"Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education subvention within the task \u201cNew methods of increasing energy and spectral efficiency and localization awareness for mobile systems\u201d, in 2020","grantNumber":"0312/SBAD/8158"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient 5G Massive MIMO: Intelligent Antenna Switching","sourcePdf":"access-hoffmann-3113461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131221S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540596","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9540597,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Huang","affiliation":["Power Electronics Machines and Control Group, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK."],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Power Electronics Machines and Control Group, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.

High-speed motor drives can fulfil those needs, but their speeds are subject to the relatively low DC-link voltage adopted by MEA. The power inverters are thus expected to efficiently and effectively manage that limited voltage. A recently popular topology is represented by the dual inverters. They are featured by inherited fault tolerance, a high DC-link voltage utilization and an excellent output power profile. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of different structures based on the dual inverter. To meet the stringent requirements of MEA applications, three performance aspects, including the voltage utilization, the inverter output quality and the fault-tolerant capability, are selected. Based on the chosen performance metrics, the key features of adopting dual inverter topologies against other converter selections are explicitly demonstrated. Finally, a practical guideline for choosing suitable dual inverters for different MEA applications is provided.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7098407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687316/7098407/09540597.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TTE.2021.3113606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TTE.2021.3113606","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technical Review of Dual Inverter Topologies for More Electric Aircraft Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540597/","displayDocTitle":"Technical Review of Dual Inverter Topologies for More Electric Aircraft Applications","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000922","fundingName":"Cleansky","grantNumber":"807081"}]},"earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technical Review of Dual Inverter Topologies for More Electric Aircraft Applications","sourcePdf":"tte-3113606-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033549S","isNumber":"7098407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687316","articleId":"9540597","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":9540599,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Hee Choi","affiliation":["Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9540599/choi-3113298-small.gif","p":["Seung-Hee Choi received the B.S. degree from the Information and Communication Engineering Department, Inha University, South Korea, where she is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Multimedia Network Laboratory.

Reliable object detection and tracking is an important research issue in various WSN applications, such as environment and disaster monitoring, disaster propagation tracking, and intruder monitoring and tracking. Generally, because batteries are used as energy sources for sensors in WSNs, a highly energy-efficient operation is needed to prolong the life of the sensors and networks. To save energy, sensors usually manage multi-mode sensing operations, in which they periodically switch between active and inactive periods. A tradeoff exists between object detection accuracy and energy efficiency when we select a sensing schedule. Depending on the object speed, direction, and sensor deployment topology, different sensing schedules should be dynamically applied to individual sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based dynamic duty cycle control method for sensor nodes. For RNN training, a target optimal duty cycle for a given network condition is derived from the proposed digital twin-space analytic solution. Simulation results show that the proposed model provides accurate object detection performance and achieves high energy efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21103597","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9540599/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recurrent Neural Network-Based Optimal Sensing Duty Cycle Control Method for Wireless Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002635","fundingName":"Inha University Research Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Recurrent Neural Network-Based Optimal Sensing Duty Cycle Control Method for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"access-yoo-3113298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07318S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540599","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9540602,"authors":[{"name":"Homa Nikbakht","affiliation":["Information Processing and Communications Laboratory (LTCI), T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Palaiseau, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9540602/nikba-3113385-small.gif","p":["Homa Nikbakht (Student Member, IEEE) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran in 2015 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris in 2020.","In January 2021, she joined the CITI Laboratory, INSA\u2014INRIA, as a Post-Doctoral Fellow.

Transmission of delay-tolerant data is also subject to a delay constraint, which is however less stringent than the one on delay-sensitive data.

However, in numerous practical situations, identifying peaks in DUET histograms is difficult, which in turn prevents effective source separation. Specifically, sound sources with short time percentages in mixtures are more unlikely to form peaks in a histogram. Besides, when the noise floor of mixtures is high, the height of the histogram peak may be reduced, which causes peak position bias and prevents effective source separation. In this study, unique methods are proposed to solve the aforementioned problems. A subhistogram is established for each time frame; thus, the original histogram is divided into a series of subhistograms. Two measurement indices are then proposed to identify the accurate attenuation and delay parameters for sound sources: maximum distribution, which is based on the infinity norm, and variance distribution, which is based on variances. The results verify that maximum distribution effectively highlights the peaks of instantaneous sound sources when the time percentage difference between sound sources is excessively high. In this scenario, the conventional histogram is unable to find the peaks. When a strong noise disturbance is present in mixtures, variance distribution can be employed to estimate peak positions with lower biases than those in the conventional histogram. In addition to more well-defined and intense peaks, the proposed method can also reduce the bias error by 71% when the SNR is 0 dB. Variance distribution is more robust against noise disturbance compared to conventional histograms and can be adopted in a wide range of applications.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113457","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09540649.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"129460","endPage":"129470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unique Methods for Determining the Attenuation and Delay in Blind Source Separation Based on the Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Unique Methods for Determining the Attenuation and Delay in Blind Source Separation Based on the Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540649/","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9540649/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","grantNumber":"109-2221-E-027-110"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Unique Methods for Determining the Attenuation and Delay in Blind Source Separation Based on the Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique","sourcePdf":"access-lian-3113457-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079534S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540649","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9540664,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Some strategies can be used to improve the parameters of these codes. For example, entanglement can provide a way for quantum error-correcting codes to achieve higher rates than the one obtained by means of the traditional stabilizer formalism. Such codes are called entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting (EAQEC) codes. In this paper, we utilize algebraic geometry codes to construct several families of EAQEC codes derived from the Euclidean and the Hermitian construction. Three families constructed here consist of codes whose quantum Singleton defect is equal to zero, one, or two. We also construct families of EAQEC codes with an encoding rate exceeding the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound. Additionally, asymptotically good towers of linear complementary dual codes are used to obtain asymptotically good families of EAQEC codes consuming maximal entanglement. Furthermore, a simple comparison with the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound demonstrates that, by utilizing the proposed construction, it is possible to generate an asymptotically family of EAQEC codes that exceeds this bound.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Codes From Algebraic Geometry Codes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3113367","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9579483/09540666.pdf","startPage":"7110","endPage":"7120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3113367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9579483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540666/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Codes From Algebraic Geometry Codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9540666/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq), Brazil","grantNumber":"201223/2018-0"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Codes From Algebraic Geometry Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-pereira-3113367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108842S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9579483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9579483","articleId":"9540666","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9540676,"authors":[{"name":"Nemin Shah","affiliation":["Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar, India"],"firstName":"Nemin","lastName":"Shah","orcid":"0000-0003-4774-3680"},{"name":"Yash Vasavada","affiliation":["Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar, India"],"firstName":"Yash","lastName":"Vasavada","orcid":"0000-0001-6001-1500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9540676","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Training","Standards","Schedules","Proposals","Floods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Layered decoding","LDPC codes","min-sum (MS)","neural networks"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose various low-complexity neural layered min-sum (NLMS) algorithms to improve the decoding performance of the fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

This paper introduces a receiver design for an energy harvesting sensor node (SN). The receiver is equipped with multiple radio frequency (RF) inputs. Furthermore, the receiver contains separate circuitries for information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) with dynamic power splitting (PS). The ID and EH circuits are connected to a power splitter that first combines all the RF inputs and then splits the power between the circuitries. Moreover, dynamic PS allows regulating the power split ratio between EH and ID circuitries. Consequently, the output of the EH circuit can be monitored and increased by adjusting the PS ratio. The proposed receiver design increases the harvestable energy by moving the ID into a separate circuitry. A voltage multiplier arranged in a Dickson scheme is used to level up the received voltage. At the transmitter side, the energy signal (ES) is sent through high power unmodulated continuous wave centered at the carrier frequency, while the information signal (IS) is sent via low power subcarriers around the carrier frequency. Such power allocation increases the harvestable power while reducing interference to external wireless networks. Moreover, different system measurements, including harvested energy from the received signal and data rates, are presented, where the split receiver scheme showed a significant improvement compared to the combined scheme in terms of harvestable power.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09540678.pdf","startPage":"129407","endPage":"129416","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Power Splitting Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Split Receiver for Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540678/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Power Splitting Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Split Receiver for Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlLink":"/document/9540678/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","accessionNumber":"21100597","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003093","fundingName":"Ministry of Higher education Malaysia","grantNumber":"FRGS19-055-0663"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Dynamic Power Splitting Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Split Receiver for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"access-ahmed-3113330-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099687S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540678","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9540680,"authors":[{"name":"Bochun Wu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of EMW Information (MoE), Fudan University, Shanghai, China","Informatization Office, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9540680/wu-3113386-small.gif","p":["Bochun Wu (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc., M.Eng., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2007, 2011, and 2021, respectively.","Since 2012, he has been a Lecturer with Fudan University, where he is currently the Networking Technical Leader with the Expert Committee, Informatization Office.

Offloading scheduling is challenging though, especially in the presence of many edge devices with randomly varying link and computing conditions. This paper presents a new online learning-based approach to the offloading scheduling, where multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) learning is designed to exploit the randomly varying conditions and asymptotically minimize the computing delay. We first propose a combinatorial bandit upper confidence bound (CB-UCB) algorithm, where users collectively feed back the observed delays of all edge devices and links. The optimistic bound of the delay is derived to facilitate centralized offloading scheduling for all users. In addition, we put forth a distributed bandit upper confidence bound (DB-UCB) algorithm, where users take random turns to make conflict-free, distributed selections of edge devices. The optimistic confidence bound of each user is developed to allow the user\u2019s selection only based on its own observations and decisions. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic optimality of the proposed algorithms by proving the sublinearity of their regrets, and that the random turns the users take to make decisions do not compromise the asymptotic optimality of the DB-UCB algorithm, as corroborated by numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113386","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09540680.pdf","startPage":"8188","endPage":"8199","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit Learning for Online Management of Edge-Assisted Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit Learning for Online Management of Edge-Assisted Computing","volume":"69","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540680/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071126"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission Grant","grantNumber":"20JC1416400"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit Learning for Online Management of Edge-Assisted Computing","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-3113386-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148083S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9540680","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9540691,"authors":[{"name":"Pratik Shah","affiliation":["Acutus Medical Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9540691/shah-3113391-small.gif","p":["Pratik Shah received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Nirma University, Ahmedabad, India, in 2007, the M.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 2009, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA, in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

We prove the exact recovery using a dual certificate by showing that the sensing matrix satisfies an incoherence property and isotropy property if the sparsity level is kept lower than the reciprocal of the largest element of a matrix created from the sensing matrix. Unlike the CS literature, this unconventional approach does not require a linear relationship between the sparsity and the number of measurements and at the same time, can easily be evaluated. This adaptability captures anisotropic measurements appropriately as with anisotropic measurements, adding more measurements does not really imply that a signal with more nonzero elements will be recovered exactly. As an illustration, we demonstrate the theory\u2019s ability to accurately handle the anisotropic (Green\u2019s function-based sensing matrix) measurements and also its similarity to the existing CS literature for isotropic (Fourier) measurements. Further, we show the usefulness of the theory in comparing different sensing matrices and in generating dielectric images.

A novel mobile blockchain network with the help of a mobile edge computing (MEC) server is presented, where all mobile users participate in the PoW mining process. The traditional Bitcoin network adjusts the target difficulty value to ensure a stable block time. However, for MEC-assisted mobile blockchain networks, the adjusted difficulty value needs to be broadcast to all mobile users, which results in expensive communication costs. To maintain a stable block time of mobile blockchain networks, we formulate the delay-limited computation offloading strategy of the PoW-based mining task as a non-cooperative game that maximizes an individual revenue in the MEC-assisted mobile blockchain network. Specifically, the non-cooperative game problem can be divided into multiple sub-game optimization problems to obtain final solutions for all users. We analyze the sub-game optimization problem and prove the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) of the non-cooperative game. Moreover, we design an alternating iterative algorithm based on the continuous relaxation and greedy rounding (CRGR) to achieve the NE of this game. Given the sub-optimal delay-limited computation offloading results, we also derive the optimal transmit power for an individual user within the maximum mining delay range. From the analytical results, we can see that the proposed CRGR-based alternating iterative algorithm can efficiently attain the sub-optimal delay-limited computation offloading strategies of all mobile users in the polynomial time. The individual transmit power increases accordingly with the delay-limited computation offloading strategies of all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CRGR-based alternating iterative algorithm has fast convergence and good stability.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113390","startPage":"8569","endPage":"8584","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

Adjusting Factors-Based Method","abstract":"High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) recorded by the intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) are the promising biomarkers of epileptogenic zones. Accurate detection of HFOs is the key to pre-operative assessment for epilepsy. Due to the subjective bias caused by manual features and the class imbalance between HFOs and false HFOs, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory detection performance by the existing methods. To solve these problems, we put forward a novel method to accurately detect HFOs based on the stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and the ensemble classifier with sample weight adjusting factors. First, the adjustable threshold of Hilbert envelopes is proposed to isolate the events of interest (EoIs) from background activities. Then, the SDAE network is utilized to automatically extract features of EoIs in the time-frequency domain. Finally, the AdaBoost-based support vector machine ensemble classifier with sample weight adjusting factors is devised to separate HFOs from EoIs by using the extracted features. These adjusting factors are used to solve the class imbalance problem by adjusting sample weights when learning the base classifiers. Our HFO detection method is evaluated by using clinical iEEG data recorded from 20 patients with medically refractory epilepsy. The experimental results show that our detection method outperforms some existing methods in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate. In addition, the HFOs detected by our method are effective for localizing seizure onset zones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540702/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21101620","pubMedId":"34529568","volume":"29","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"HFO Detection in Epilepsy: A Stacked Denoising Autoencoder and Sample Weight Adjusting Factors-Based Method","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61733016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2015CFA010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013314","fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B17040"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"HFO Detection in Epilepsy: A Stacked Denoising Autoencoder and Sample Weight Adjusting Factors-Based Method","sourcePdf":"tnsre-wu-3113293-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093762S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"9363468","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","xplore-issue":"9363468","articleId":"9540702","onlineDate":"16 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9540708,"authors":[{"name":"Uyoata Uyoata","affiliation":["Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Nigeria","University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9540708/uyoat-3112940-small.gif","p":["Uyoata Uyoata (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Federal University of Technology, Yola, in 2009, the M.Sc. degree in personal, mobile, and satellite communication from the University of Bradford, in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree from the Centre of Excellence in Broadband Networks, University of Cape Town, in 2019.

In cellular-based IoT, relays have the potential to reduce base station overload. The energy expended in single-hop long-range communication can be reduced if relays listen to transmissions of end devices and forward these observations to gateways. However, incorporating relays into IoT networks faces some challenges. IoT end devices are designed primarily for uplink communication of small-sized observations toward the network; hence, opportunistically using end devices as relays needs a redesign of both the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol of such end devices and possible addition of new communication interfaces. Additionally, the wake-up time of IoT end devices needs to be synchronized with that of the relays. For cellular-based IoT, the possibility of using infrastructure relays exists, and noncellular IoT networks can leverage the presence of mobile devices for relaying, for example, in remote healthcare. However, the latter presents problems of incentivizing relay participation and managing the mobility of relays. Furthermore, although relays can increase the lifetime of IoT networks, deploying relays implies the need for additional batteries to power them. This can erode the energy efficiency gain that relays offer. Therefore, designing relay-assisted IoT networks that provide acceptable trade-offs is key, and this goes beyond adding an extra transmit RF chain to a relay-enabled IoT end device. There has been increasing research interest in IoT relaying, as demonstrated in the available literature. Works that consider these issues are surveyed in this paper to provide insight into the state of the art, provide design insights for network designers and motivate future research directions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and

Previous generation of SiP coherent imagers suffer from relative optical phase fluctuations between the signal and reference paths, which results in random phase and amplitude fluctuations in the output signal. This limitation negatively impacts the SNR and signal acquisition times. Here we present a coherent imager system that suppresses the optical carrier signal and removes non-idealities from the relative optical path using a photonic in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) receiver via a 90\u2218 hybrid detector. Furthermore, we incorporate row-column read-out and row-column addressing schemes to address the electro-optical interconnect density challenge. Our novel row-column read-out architecture for the sensor array requires only 2N interconnects for N2 sensors. An 8\u00d78 IQ sensor array is presented as a proof-of-concept demonstration with 1.2\u00d710-5 resolution over range accuracy. Free-space FMCW ranging with 250 resolution at 1 distance has been demonstrated using this sensor array.","doi":"10.1109/OJSSCS.2021.3113264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Solid-State Circuits Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Solid-State Circuits Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782712/9530264/09540747.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJSSCS.2021.3113264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9530264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IQ Photonic Receiver for Coherent Imaging with a Scalable Aperture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"IQ Photonic Receiver for Coherent Imaging with a Scalable Aperture","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"IQ Photonic Receiver for Coherent Imaging with a Scalable Aperture","sourcePdf":"ojsscs-3113264-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046553S","isNumber":"9530264","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782712","articleId":"9540747","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":9540756,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah Aljuffri","affiliation":["EEMCS Faculty, Delft University of Technology, Delft, CD, The Netherlands","King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9594522/9540756/aljuf-3111407-small.gif","p":["Abdullah Aljuffri (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in computer engineering from Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 2017, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering.","His research interests are in the areas of application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)/FPGA design, hardware security, and side-channel analysis, with emphasis on power attacks and countermeasures."]},"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Aljuffri","orcid":"0000-0002-2333-4754"},{"name":"Marc Zwalua","affiliation":["EEMCS Faculty, Delft University of Technology, Delft, CD, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9594522/9540756/zwalu-3111407-small.gif","p":["Marc Zwalua received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in microelectronics from Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Several physical leakage sources can be exploited in SCAs, such as power, time, heat, and so on. Heat is one of the side-channels that is not frequently analyzed by attackers in the literature due to the high noise associated with thermal traces. This article investigates the practicality of adapting power-based SCAs [i.e., correlation power analysis (CPA) and deep-learning-based power attacks (DL-based PA)] for thermal attacks and refer to them as correlation thermal attack (CTA) and DL-based thermal attack (DL-based TA). In addition, we introduce a new attack called progressive CTA (PCTA). We evaluate the different thermal SCAs against an unprotected and protected software implementation of Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman (RSA). Our results show the practicality of the three attacks (i.e. CTA, DL-based TA, and PCTA) as a 100% key recovery is realized.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3111407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9594522/09540756.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3111407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594522","startPage":"1930","endPage":"1942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Thermal Side-Channel Attacks on Asymmetric Cryptography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Applying Thermal Side-Channel Attacks on Asymmetric Cryptography","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540756/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540756/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Thermal Side-Channel Attacks on Asymmetric Cryptography","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-aljuffri-3111407-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090188S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9594522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9594522","articleId":"9540756","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9540759,"authors":[{"name":"Yongsheng Cao","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Technology, East China University of Political Science and Law, Shanghai 200042, China; College of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University.

The coordinated networked microgrids (MGs) contain renewable distributed generations (DGs) and nonrenewable DGs, which will be an important component in the future. We formulate an optimization problem based on a transactive energy (TE) framework for the energy schedule of upstream network and networked MGs to minimize the operation cost. The energy management between MGs and upstream network is operated by the distribution system operator (DSO), which is different from the direct control signal and fixed pricing mechanism in the traditional power system. We develop a distributionally robust optimization algorithm with ambiguity set based on Wasserstein distance (DROW) to solve the optimization problem with the uncertainties from real-time electricity price, renewable energy, loads, and electric vehicles. We carry out case studies about the energy schedule of the modified IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 118-bus power system with networked MGs. Numerical results indicate that the TE framework is conducive to schedule the energy of upstream network and networked MGs efficiently with the dynamic pricing scheme and the proposed DROW algorithm can seek a robust energy schedule of DSO and networked MGs with uncertainties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540759/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isEarlyAccess":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Energy Management for Multi-microgrid under A Transactive Energy Framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key interdisciplinary project for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"223201800084"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of the Shanghai Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"15220710600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301118, 61772130 and 71171045"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201906630026"},{"fundingName":"Humanities and Social Science Research Project of Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"20YJC820030"},{"fundingName":"CivilMilitary Integration Project for Shanghai Economic and Information Commission","grantNumber":"JMRH-2018-1042"}]},"earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Energy Management for Multi-microgrid under A Transactive Energy Framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsg-3113573-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038352S","isNumber":"5446437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","articleId":"9540759","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":9540774,"authors":[{"name":"Keerthipriya Sathish","affiliation":["Avionics, Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Keerthipriya","lastName":"Sathish","orcid":"0000-0002-0290-0825"},{"name":"Chinmoy Saha","affiliation":["Avionics, Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Chinmoy","lastName":"Saha","orcid":"0000-0002-2781-7964"},{"name":"Debdeep Sarkar","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, K7K 7B4 Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Debdeep","lastName":"Sarkar","orcid":"0000-0001-7993-6482"},{"name":"Jawad Y.

Meanwhile, there have emerged some deep learning-based text editing algorithms which alter the textual information of an image in an end-to-end fashion. In this work, we present a low-cost document forgery algorithm by the existing deep learning-based technologies to edit practical document images. To achieve this goal, the limitations of existing text editing algorithms towards complicated characters and complex background are addressed by a set of network design strategies. First, the unnecessary confusion in the supervision data is avoided by disentangling the textual and background information in the source images. Second, to capture the structure of some complicated components, the text skeleton is provided as auxiliary information and the continuity in texture is considered explicitly in the loss function. Third, the forgery traces induced by the text editing operation are mitigated by some post-processing operations which consider the distortions from the print-and-scan channel. Quantitative comparisons of the proposed method and the exiting approach have shown the advantages of our design by reducing the about 2/3 reconstruction error measured in MSE, improving reconstruction quality measured in PSNR and in SSIM by 4 dB and 0.21, respectively. Qualitative experiments have confirmed that the reconstruction results of the proposed method are visually better than the existing approach in both complicated characters and complex texture. More importantly, we have demonstrated the performance of the proposed document forgery algorithm under a practical scenario where an attacker is able to alter the textual information in an identity document using only one sample in the target domain. The forged-and-recaptured samples created by the proposed text editing attack and recapturing operation have successfully fooled some existing document authentication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540787/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2021","publicationDate":"2021","pubMedId":"34534085","volume":"30","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-Based Forgery Attack on Document Images","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2019B010139003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"62072313 and U19B2022"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100021171","fundingName":"Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2020A1515010563"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100017622","fundingName":"Shenzhen Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"20200813110043002 and GJHZ20180928155814437"},{"fundingName":"Alibaba Group through Alibaba Innovative Research (AIR) Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning-Based Forgery Attack on Document Images","sourcePdf":"tip-zhao-3112048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11355S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"9263394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","xplore-issue":"9263394","articleId":"9540787","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9540801,"authors":[{"name":"Anindya Bharatee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, 769008 India"],"firstName":"Anindya","lastName":"Bharatee"},{"name":"Pravat K.

The sporadic characteristics of sustainable energy sources along with the random load variations greatly affect the power quality and stability of the system. Hence, it requires storage systems having both high energy and high-power handling capacity to coexist in microgrids. An efficient energy management structure is designed in this paper for a grid-united PV system combined with hybrid storage of supercapacitor and battery. The combined battery and supercapacitor storage system grips the average and transient power changes, which provides a quick control for the DC link voltage, i.e., it stabilizes the system and helps to achieve the PV power smoothing. The average power distribution between the power grid and battery is done by checking the state of charge (SOC) of a battery, and an effective and efficient energy management scheme is proposed. Additionally, the use of a supercapacitor lessens the current stress on the battery system during unexpected disparity in the generated power and load requirement. The performance and efficacy of the proposed energy management approach are justified by simulation studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry

The norms of the controller are optimized using the teaching-learning-based optimization. A dynamic frequency model of two area microgrids interconnected through a tie-line has been employed to inspect the frequency control of microgrids. Generation using numerous renewable resources and storage sources are considered in suitable combination. The dynamics of dc-link along with measurement unit are also considered in each of the microgrids. In addition, the microgrids are designed with demand response program to damp out the oscillations. A comparative analysis of controllers designed using various existing algorithms namely particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing has been presented. The system response attained is compared to that of other forms of controllers in the literature. Varying input conditions are assumed for wind and solar generation units and their respective frequency responses are studied utilizing two of the best performing algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isEarlyAccess":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Frequency Control in Interconnected Microgrids: An H<formula><tex>$_2$</tex></formula>/H<formula><tex>$_{\\infty }$</tex></formula> Control Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"VILLUM FONDEN","grantNumber":"25920"},{"fundingName":"Center for Research on Microgrids"}]},"earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Frequency Control in Interconnected Microgrids: An H<formula><tex>$_2$</tex></formula>/H<formula><tex>$_{\\infty }$</tex></formula> Control Approach","sourcePdf":"jsyst-suman-3108685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039455S","isNumber":"4357939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","articleId":"9540808","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":9540828,"authors":[{"name":"Lusekelo Kibona","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9540828/kibon-3113782-small.gif","p":["Lusekelo Kibona received the B.S. degree from the University of Dar es salaam, in 2007, and the M.S. degree from Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology, in 2014.

The system model which includes new defined total intake power involving the transmit power of amplifiers and the circuit power intake of the analog devices is developed. To analyze the impact of circuit intake power on S.E.E, the S.E.E with and without circuit intake power is investigated and presented after formulating a closed-form expression of S.E.E that incorporates new defined power model. Our investigation reveals that, the impact of circuit intake power is very significant when Base Station (BS) is arrayed with large number of antennas. Using the new S.E.E closed-form formula, derived from our new defined power intake model, the S.E.E is evaluated when the number of BS antennas (M) rises and it is observed that, S.E.E behaves like a concave function. The same results for S.E.E are also observed when transmit power increases. We conclude that, it is easy to get maximum S.E.E using a small number of BS antennas and optimal transmit power, when circuit power intake is included in the power consumption model. When transmit power totally dominates the circuit intake power, the maximum S.E.E is obtained only when all antennas are used (meaning maximum S.E.E is obtained when the number of BS antennas becomes very large). The numerical results reveal the importance of circuit intake power on optimizing S.E.E of massive MIMO under the presence of channel estimation errors.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09540828.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"133820","endPage":"133834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Circuit Intake Power on the Spectral Energy Efficiency of Massive MIMO With Channel Estimation Errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Circuit Intake Power on the Spectral Energy Efficiency of Massive MIMO With Channel Estimation Errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540828/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540828/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1806904"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071192"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003397","fundingName":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Impact of Circuit Intake Power on the Spectral Energy Efficiency of Massive MIMO With Channel Estimation Errors","sourcePdf":"access-kibona-3113782-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098422S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540828","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9540833,"authors":[{"name":"Jinwoo Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.

In our methodology, we first generate a commercial-grade heterogeneous 2.5D IC designs including full signal routing and power delivery. We then perform our PDN co-analysis in frequency and time domains on the entire PDN to evaluate various mechanisms added to our PDN designs. Based on our co-analysis results, we perform the system-level optimization on both interposer and chiplet PDNs with the stable performance of power delivery. Finally, we perform power, performance and area (PPA) analysis and power integrity (PI) on our 2.5D designs and discuss tradeoffs in chiplet and interposer levels due to PDN optimization. Our experiments show 27.17% improvement in the overall IR-drop in the optimized 2.5D IC design by increasing the interposer PDN occupancy by 5.52% and inserting the additional PDN grids in chiplet designs. However, we also observe tradeoffs in terms of PPA and PI. By PDN optimization, the optimized design has 11.6% increase of the total power, while the area of 2.5D design remains the same. Moreover, from the perspective of PI, the tradeoffs are shown by 0.6% reduction of power efficiency, 32.6% higher output ripple, and 31.5% higher initial ringing because of an inductive behavior of interposer PDN in the optimized design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540833/","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Chiplet/Interposer Co-Design for Power Delivery Network Optimization in Heterogeneous 2.5D ICs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"N00014-17-1-2950"}]},"earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chiplet/Interposer Co-Design for Power Delivery Network Optimization in Heterogeneous 2.5D ICs","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-3113664-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033399S","isNumber":"5673025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","articleId":"9540833","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":9540836,"authors":[{"name":"Maksym A.

To ensure full power efficiency, the method is restricted to phase-only weight manipulations. Our framework is based on the discovered connection between dual-polarized beamforming and polyphase Golay sequences. Exploiting this connection, we propose several methods for array expansion from smaller to larger sizes, while preserving the radiation pattern. In addition, to fill the gaps in the feasible array sizes, we introduce the concept of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-complementarity that relaxes the requirement on zero side lobes of the sum aperiodic autocorrelation function of a sequence pair. Furthermore, we develop a modified Great Deluge algorithm (MGDA) that finds \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-complementary pairs of arbitrary length, and hence enables broad beamforming for arbitrarily-sized uniform linear arrays. We also discuss the extension of this approach to two-dimensional uniform rectangular arrays. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach with respect to existing beam-broadening methods.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113755","startPage":"8429","endPage":"8442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09540836.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Cell-Specific Beamforming for Large Antenna Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540836/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Cell-Specific Beamforming for Large Antenna Arrays","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9540836/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Cell-Specific Beamforming for Large Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"tcomm-petersson-3113755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076564S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9540836","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9540838,"authors":[{"name":"Binish Raza","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9540838/raza-3113637-small.gif","p":["Binish Raza received the bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering from Pakistan, in 2012, and the master\u2019s degree from the University of Engineering and Technology Lahore (UET), Lahore, Pakistan, in 2013.

The recent decades have shown a progressive growth in STC, resulting in an increasing number of research studies in the scientific corpora. However, no existing study has systematically analyzed and illustrated the research patterns, latest trends, and evolution in STC. This study aims to explore the knowledge structure and create evolutionary trajectories from STC publications. To achieve this aim, a scientometric analysis is performed that combined a critical literature review (CLR) of STC-related published research in the Web of Science and Scopus databases from 2000 to 2020. The scientometric analysis is conducted through four scientometric techniques: 1) co-word network analysis; 2) co-author network analysis; 3) co-citation analysis; 4) document clustering with timeline analysis. The study outcomes will help understand and visualize STC\u2019s research status quo. CLR is objectively conducted to recognize the latest research topics, themes, and salient features of STC research in software development. A total of 306 bibliographic data are analyzed to generate study-related networks and density visualizations. The results reveal an evolution in the STC field from its conception to the recent developments of STC models and other related factors. This study primarily contributes to the literature by providing a systematic view related to STC research to assist software practitioners in identifying applications and key research areas. Moreover, the combination of scientometric analysis and CLR reveals key researchers, journals and conferences, institutions, prominent contributing countries, and six major research themes, including \u201ccommunity structure\u201d and \u201csocio-technical congruence\u201d as the most prominent ones.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113637","startPage":"129051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09540838.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113637","endPage":"129077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Socio-Technical Congruence as an Emerging Concept in Software Development: A Scientometric Analysis and Critical Literature Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540838/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Socio-Technical Congruence as an Emerging Concept in Software Development: A Scientometric Analysis and Critical Literature Review","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9540838/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2021","publicationDate":"2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Socio-Technical Congruence as an Emerging Concept in Software Development: A Scientometric Analysis and Critical Literature Review","sourcePdf":"access-ahmad-3113637-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1806S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540838","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9540842,"authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth Jordan","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9540842/jorda-3113812-small.gif","p":["Elizabeth Jordan received the B.S. degree (Hons.) in mechanical engineering from the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park, MD, USA, in December 2020, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering.","Her engineering work experience includes six internships and co-ops with GE Aviation and AEDC Wind Tunnel 9.

As shown in this paper, optimization studies in the context of COVID-19 have been used for many aspects of the pandemic. From these studies, it is observed that since COVID-19 is a multifaceted problem, it cannot be studied from a single perspective or framework, and neither can the related optimization models. Four new and different frameworks are proposed that capture the essence of analyzing COVID-19 (or any pandemic for that matter) and the relevant optimization models. These are: (i) microscale vs. macroscale perspective; (ii) early stages vs. later stages perspective; (iii) aspects with direct vs. indirect relationship to COVID-19; and (iv) compartmentalized perspective. To limit the scope of the review, only optimization studies related to the prediction and control of COVID-19 are considered (public health focused), and which utilize formal optimization techniques or machine learning approaches. In this context and to the best of our knowledge, this survey paper is the first in the literature with a focus on the prediction and control related optimization studies. These studies include optimization of screening testing strategies, prediction, prevention and control, resource management, vaccination prioritization, and decision support tools. Upon reviewing the literature, this paper identifies current gaps and major challenges that hinder the closure of these gaps and provides some insights into future research directions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization in the Context of COVID-19 Prediction and Control: A Literature Review","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113812","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09540842.pdf","startPage":"130072","endPage":"130093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540842/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Optimization in the Context of COVID-19 Prediction and Control: A Literature Review","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9540842/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"generous gift from Dr. Alex Mehr (M.S., Ph.D. \u201903), Co-Founder and CEO of Retail ECommerce Ventures, through the \u201cDesign Decision Support Laboratory Research and Education Fund\u201d"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optimization in the Context of COVID-19 Prediction and Control: A Literature Review","sourcePdf":"access-jordan-3113812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.340376S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540842","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9540844,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

It increases the computing power consumption of the cloud\u2019s systems. Consolidation of cloud\u2019s Virtual Machines (VMs) provides a pragmatic approach to reduce the energy consumption of cloud Data Centers (DC). Effective VM consolidation and VM migration without breaching Service Level Agreement (SLA) can be attained by taking proactive decisions based on cloud\u2019s future workload prediction. Effective task scheduling, another major issue of cloud computing also relies on accurate forecasting of resource usage. Cloud workload traces exhibit both periodic and non-periodic patterns with the sudden peak of load. As a result, it is very challenging for the prediction models to precisely forecast future workload. This prompted us to propose a hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based prediction model named BHyPreC. BHyPreC architecture includes Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) on top of the stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Here, BHyPreC is used to predict future CPU usage workload of cloud\u2019s VM. Our proposed model enhances the non-linear data analysis capability of Bi-LSTM, LSTM, and GRU models separately and demonstrates better accuracy compared to other statistical models. The effect of variation of historical window size and training-testing data size on these models is observed. The experimental result shows that our model gives higher accuracy and performs better in comparison to Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM model for both short-term ahead and long-term ahead prediction.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09540844.pdf","startPage":"131476","endPage":"131495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BHyPreC: A Novel Bi-LSTM Based Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network Model to Predict the CPU Workload of Cloud Virtual Machine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"BHyPreC: A Novel Bi-LSTM Based Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network Model to Predict the CPU Workload of Cloud Virtual Machine","htmlLink":"/document/9540844/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"BHyPreC: A Novel Bi-LSTM Based Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network Model to Predict the CPU Workload of Cloud Virtual Machine","sourcePdf":"access-maswood-3113714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163627S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540844","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9540848,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper derives the likelihood distribution of image priors which has been further used to denoise the image. This paper aims to maximize the likelihood estimation of the parameters of interest i.e. prior and posterior estimation. We have proposed a prior-based distribution model which has been applied to additive, multiplicative and mixed noise cases. The various estimation parameters such as statistical variance and mean parameters have been used to evaluate the maximum likelihood of image priors for these noise models. Later, we have used an optimization technique based on the likelihood to reconstruct noise-free images efficiently. This paper uses conditional likelihood and wavelet transformation-based minimization techniques to minimize the noise in the pixels and a final denoised image is recovered. The conditional likelihood of the image has been optimized using pixel-based minimization w.r.t. the wavelet transformation coefficients. The simulation and analytical results have also been presented for the different noise cases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Likelihood Estimation and Wavelet Transformation Based Optimization for Minimization of Noisy Pixels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113857","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09540856.pdf","startPage":"132168","endPage":"132190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Likelihood Estimation and Wavelet Transformation Based Optimization for Minimization of Noisy Pixels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9540856/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003141","fundingName":"Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas, Mexico, through the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CONACYT) Mexico"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Likelihood Estimation and Wavelet Transformation Based Optimization for Minimization of Noisy Pixels","sourcePdf":"access-malik-3113857-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166579S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540856","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9540859,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroya Kato","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, Kohoku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9540859/kato-3113711-small.gif","p":["Hiroya Kato (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) was born in Gunma, Japan, in 1994.

Among various detection schemes, permission pair based ones are promising for practical detection. However, conventional schemes cannot simultaneously meet requirements for practical use in terms of efficiency, intelligibility, and stability of detection performance. Although the latest scheme relies on differences of frequent pairs between benign apps and malware, it cannot meet the stability. This is because recent malware tends to require unnecessary permissions to imitate benign apps, which makes using the frequencies ineffective. To meet all the requirements, in this paper, we propose Android malware detection based on a Composition Ratio (CR) of permission pairs. We define the CR as a ratio of a permission pair to all pairs in an app. We focus on the fact that the CR tends to be small in malware because of unnecessary permissions. To obtain features without using the frequencies, we construct databases about the CR. For each app, we calculate similarity scores based on the databases. Finally, eight scores are fed into machine learning (ML) based classifiers as features. By doing this, stable performance can be achieved. Since our features are just eight-dimensional, the proposed scheme takes less training time and is compatible with other ML based schemes. Furthermore, our features can quantitatively offer clear information that helps human to understand detection results. Our scheme is suitable for practical use because all the requirements can be met. By using real datasets, our results show that our scheme can detect malware with up to 97.3% accuracy.

NDDEs have applications in modeling physical and biological systems. An NDDE model may consist of several parameters, some of which can be determined using available data. Various numerical techniques have been studied to estimate parameters of mathematical models. In this study, parameter estimation is posed as an optimization problem. The use of heuristic algorithms in parameter estimation has gained popularity because of its ease of implementation, requiring only function evaluations. But to our knowledge, heuristic algorithms have never been employed in estimating parameters in NDDE models. In this work, we apply Genetic Algorithm with Multi-Parent Crossover (GA-MPC) to obtain parameter estimates of three NDDE models with a discrete delay. We compare the estimates to those obtained using standard heuristic algorithms. Results show that GA-MPC is capable of consistently identifying model parameters that provide a good fit of the model to the data.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113677","startPage":"131348","endPage":"131364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09540872.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter Estimation in Neutral Delay Differential Equations Using Genetic Algorithm With Multi-Parent Crossover","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540872/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parameter Estimation in Neutral Delay Differential Equations Using Genetic Algorithm With Multi-Parent Crossover","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9540872/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011894","fundingName":"Natural Sciences Research Institute, University of the Philippines Diliman","grantNumber":"MAT-21-1-02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Parameter Estimation in Neutral Delay Differential Equations Using Genetic Algorithm With Multi-Parent Crossover","sourcePdf":"access-mendoza-3113677-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101286S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9540872","onlineDate":"17 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9540881,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"9540881","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540881","abstract":"The wireless communication\u2019s frequency spectrum has been continuously expanding to satisfy ever-increasing bandwidth demands. Although millimeter-wave (mmWave) band communications are already shaping the fifth-generation (5G) wireless mobile communications, terahertz (THz) band communications will be essential to the future sixth generation (6G) and beyond for a number of reasons. In contrast to mmWave communications, THz communications can exploit the available spectrum to achieve a terabits per second data rate without additional spectral efficiency enhancement techniques. Furthermore, due to the shorter wavelengths, THz signals are less susceptible to free-space diffraction and inter-antenna interference and exhibit higher resilience to eavesdropping. THz systems can also support higher link directionality and can be achieved in much smaller footprints. In contrast, compared to visible light communications, THz signals are not as severely affected by alignment issues, ambient light, atmospheric turbulence, scintillation, fog, and temporary spatial variation in light intensity.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2021.3108375","startPage":"1626","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/9540802/09540881.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2021.3108375","endPage":"1627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9540802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scanning the Issue","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Scanning the Issue","volume":"109","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/9540881/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scanning the Issue","sourcePdf":"jproc-scanning-3108375-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033987S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"9540802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","xplore-issue":"9540802","articleId":"9540881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9540882,"authors":[{"name":"Shiwen He","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/9540802/9540882/he-3107494-small.gif","p":["Shiwen He (Member, IEEE) received the M.S. degree in computational mathematics from Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2013.","Since April 2018, he has been a Professor with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China.

Recently, an extensive amount of work on mmWave communication has been carried out by researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry, and various technologies have been developed for mmWave communication systems to fulfill the full potential of mmWave frequency bands. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of the standardization of mmWave communication, the latest progress and outcomes of the research on mmWave communication technologies, and the emerging applications of mmWave communication. In particular, we provide a timely and in-depth summary of the state-of-the-art technology specifications of mmWave communication with an emphasis on the physical (PHY) layer. Then, we elaborate on a number of well-established or promising antenna architectures in mmWave communication systems and investigate the enabling PHY layer transmission technologies.

In particular, recent research has shown DL to be an enabling technology for Cognitive Radio (CR) applications as well as a useful tool for supplementing expertly defined algorithms for spectrum awareness applications such as signal detection, estimation, and classification. A major driver for the usage of RFML is that little, to no, \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n knowledge of the intended spectral environment is required, given that there is an abundance of representative raw Radio Frequency (RF) data to facilitate training and evaluation. However, in addition to this fundamental need for sufficient data, there are other key considerations, such as trust, security, and hardware requirements, that must be taken into account before deploying RFML systems in real-world wireless communication applications that largely go unaddressed in the current literature. This paper examines the prior works related to these major research considerations, with focus on the dependencies between them and factors unique to the RFML space.","doi":"10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3112939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782661/9309127/09540909.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9309127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3112939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","startPage":"2243","endPage":"2264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An RFML Ecosystem: Considerations for the Application of Deep Learning to Spectrum Situational Awareness","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"An RFML Ecosystem: Considerations for the Application of Deep Learning to Spectrum Situational Awareness","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540909/","volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9540909/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21102416","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An RFML Ecosystem: Considerations for the Application of Deep Learning to Spectrum Situational Awareness","sourcePdf":"ojcoms-wong-3112939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.284357S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782661","isNumber":"9309127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782661","xplore-issue":"9309127","articleId":"9540909","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":9540949,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Amin Karimi","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL 60616 USA (e-mail: mkarimi1@hawk.iit.edu)."],"firstName":"Mohammad Amin","lastName":"Karimi"},{"name":"Vahid Alizadehyazdi","affiliation":["James Franck Institute, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA (e-mail: vahid@uchicago.edu)."],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Alizadehyazdi"},{"name":"Heinrich M.

This article describes the robot\u2019s design, object handling capabilities, locomotion, shape formation, and ability to navigate narrow corridors.

However, the representation power of CNNs for speech modeling is limited because of the spatial-agnostic convolution kernels. This letter proposes a novel feature-specific convolution neural network (FSCNet) for real-time speech enhancement. In FSCNet, the encoder and decoder are adopted for forward and inverse feature space transformation, respectively. The denoising module based on the feature-specific convolution (FSC) is employed to enhance the generated deep features. Leveraging the long-term global contexts and considering the importance of each feature channel for speech modeling, the convolution kernels of FSC are dynamically parameterized in each time-frequency location. A function-constrained loss is further proposed to train the FSCNet, ensuring the encoder, denoising modules and decoder can function as expected. Experimental results show that the proposed FSCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art denoising algorithms in terms of five objective evaluation metrics and model size.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3113604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09540980.pdf","startPage":"1958","endPage":"1962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3113604","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FSCNet: Feature-Specific Convolution Neural Network for Real-Time Speech Enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9540980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"FSCNet: Feature-Specific Convolution Neural Network for Real-Time Speech Enhancement","volume":"28","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9540980/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research","grantNumber":"2020YFC2004104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11911540067"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FSCNet: Feature-Specific Convolution Neural Network for Real-Time Speech Enhancement","sourcePdf":"lsp-li-3113604-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074079S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9540980","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9540988,"authors":[{"name":"Haotian Fu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9610147/9540988/fu-3111620-small.gif","p":["Haotian Fu is currently pursuing the B.S. degree with the College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China.

However, hardware circuits that can perform the efficient analog computation to solve them are rarely in the literature. To address such problems, this paper proposes a general method of using a memristor-capacitor (M-C) circuit to solve inhomogeneous linear ODEs and systems of ODEs of any order in initial value problems. The M-C circuit can match the coefficients of the equations sought by adjusting the memristor resistance value according to the coefficient formula proposed in the paper, which has higher programmability. Then, some ODEs and systems of ODEs are given in the paper as examples to evaluate the proposed method. According to the comparison results based on MATLAB software simulation and the simulation based on OrCAD software, the designed M-C circuit has an effective improvement in speed and the accuracy exceeds 99.95% in software simulation.

To overcome the blockage problem, we consider two approaches: multi-connectivity and network densification. The multi-connectivity opens up a new paradigm for user centric communication, where each user autonomously chooses multiple base stations (BSs) to attain high quality services. The network densification allows network operators to deploy many BSs in a limited area, thereby providing qualified communication services to users. In this paper, we study user equipment (UE) association control in user centric mmWave communication environments. When a UE arrives, the network provides the UE with information on the resource status of adjacent BSs, and the UE generates a set of candidate BSs. For access control, we formulate two optimization problems that aim to minimize peak load and sum load, respectively. They are non-convex and combinatorial, so their computational complexity grows exponentially with the problem size. As a solution, we develop an access pricing and peak load limit control scheme. Through numerical experiments, we investigate its impact on the performance of mmWave communication systems. The results show that our proposed scheme successfully provides high quality services to users and allocates the network load fairly over the network.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3113470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3113470","startPage":"12001","endPage":"12012","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/9619988/09541000.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9619988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Association Control for User Centric Millimeter Wave Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Association Control for User Centric Millimeter Wave Communication Systems","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","volume":"70","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9541000/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541000/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2020R1A2C2101815"},{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010449","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2018R1D1A1B07048948"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Association Control for User Centric Millimeter Wave Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-choi-3113470-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074165S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9619988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"9619988","articleId":"9541000","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9541006,"authors":[{"name":"Zaher Zak Kassas","affiliation":["Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, United States, 92697 (e-mail: zkassas@ieee.org)"],"firstName":"Zaher Zak","lastName":"Kassas"},{"name":"Joe Khalife","affiliation":["Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, UC Irvine, 8788 Irvine, California, United States, 92617 (e-mail: khalifej@uci.edu)"],"firstName":"Joe","lastName":"Khalife"},{"name":"Mohammad Neinavaie","affiliation":["Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, United States, (e-mail: mneinava@uci.edu)"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Neinavaie"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"9541006","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541006","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Receivers","Low earth orbit satellites","Tracking loops","Noise measurement","Downlink","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["signals of opportunity","carrier phase positioning","low Earth orbit","Starlink"]}],"abstract":"This letter shows the first carrier phase tracking and positioning results with Starlinks low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite signals.

Using their difference coarrays, subspace-based approaches can be utilized to perform underdetermined and high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. However, the subspace-based approaches depend on the covariance matrix reconstruction in the coarray domain, which are not statistically efficient when the number of sources is more than one and less than the number of sensors. In this paper, to overcome this drawback, we devise an augmented covariance matrix reconstruction algorithm for DOA estimation in the coarray domain. The proposed algorithm recovers the complete augmented covariance matrix by solving a rank-minimization problem. But unlike the conventional schemes, it exploits the estimation error distribution of the incomplete augmented covariance matrix to derive the constraint condition of the rank-minimization problem. Based on the reconstructed augmented covariance matrix, we can enhance the DOA estimation performance for multiple source scenario at high signal-to-noise ratio. Although our algorithm is developed based on the non-consecutive coarray, it is also suitable for the consecutive coarray.

Ground deformation often occurs with improper construction activities. Such deformation can be measured with techniques such as multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR). However, the deformation anomalies, such as the building horizontal tilt can cause the MT-InSAR line-of-sight deformation to tend to zero, the deformed area is likely to be ignored when the individual SAR dataset is applied. In this article, we explore deformation induced by the underground construction of To Kwa Wan (TKW) station in Hong Kong with an improved MT-InSAR method. Multiplatform SAR datasets from TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1A are adopted to retrieve comprehensive deformation of ground buildings for stability investigation. The results are validated through cross-validation between SAR datasets. Both spatial and temporal variations of ground deformation are revealed. Ground buildings suffered significant deformation in vertical and horizontal directions, the maximum deformation is around 30 and 40 mm, respectively. Due to the anomalous deformation, the ground buildings around the station are dumped towards the street center. In view of temporal evolution, the deformation is strongly related to the construction stages. The deformation turned to be stable after the completion of the main framework of the TKW station in December 2016. This article suggests that the deformation obtained from individual SAR datasets may sometimes is not noticeable or reliable in the area with complex underground construction. Such complex phenomena can be revealed by using the multiplatform SAR datasets with MT-InSAR.","topic":"Time series remote sensing for land surface dynamics monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9541035/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting the Deformation Anomalies Induced by Underground Construction Using Multiplatform MT-InSAR: A Case Study in To Kwa Wan Station, Hong Kong","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Chang'an University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFC1512001"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"152232/17E, 152164/18E and 152233/19E"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011650","fundingName":"Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development, Hong Kong Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"1-BBWB"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation","grantNumber":"2021A1515011427"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program","grantNumber":"20200807110745001, KQJSCX20180328093453763 and JCYJ20180305125101282"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41974006"},{"fundingName":"Research Program from the Department of Education of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2018KTSCX196"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Detecting the Deformation Anomalies Induced by Underground Construction Using Multiplatform MT-InSAR: A Case Study in To Kwa Wan Station, Hong Kong","sourcePdf":"jstars-wu-3113672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137467S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","topics":["Time series remote sensing for land surface dynamics monitoring"],"articleId":"9541035","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9541056,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/9619988/9541056/liu-3113339-small.gif","p":["Chang Liu (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

In this paper, the JO ML detection of two quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) signals with an arbitrary relative phase offset is investigated. Exact, analytical symbol error rate (SER) and bit error rate (BER) formulas are derived for two users with no less than 3 dB power difference between them. Closed-form union bounds on the user SER and BER with an arbitrary phase offset and an arbitrary user power ratio are also given as a simpler approach to acquire the asymptotic error rate performance. Furthermore, insights on the potentials and properties of the JO ML detector regarding its error rate behaviors for each user are revealed through comparisons with the successive interference cancellation receiver. The accuracies of the obtained formulas are demonstrated through simulation. The results show the error rates for the two-user QPSK case no longer follow the classic knowledge on the error rate behaviors in the single signal detection. In addition, the performance and dB penalty employing different modulation types are also compared and discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9619988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3113339","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/9619988/09541056.pdf","startPage":"11695","endPage":"11709","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3113339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact SER and BER Analysis on Jointly Optimal Maximum Likelihood Detection of Two QPSK Signals With Phase Offset","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Exact SER and BER Analysis on Jointly Optimal Maximum Likelihood Detection of Two QPSK Signals With Phase Offset","volume":"70","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9541056/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","accessionNumber":"21276905","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541056/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact SER and BER Analysis on Jointly Optimal Maximum Likelihood Detection of Two QPSK Signals With Phase Offset","sourcePdf":"tvt-liu-3113339-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08811S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9619988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"9619988","articleId":"9541056","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9541057,"authors":[{"name":"Abdul Rehman Aslam","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/9643424/9541057/aslam-3113613-small.gif","p":["Abdul Rehman Aslam (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan, in 2008, and the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Lahore, Pakistan, in 2012.

However, most existing MTL networks run on a single end and are not suitable for collaborative intelligence (CI) scenarios. In this work, we propose an MTL network with a deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, which allows operating under CI scenarios. We first propose a feature fusion based MTL network (FFMNet) for joint object detection and semantic segmentation. Compared with other MTL networks, FFMNet gets higher performance with fewer parameters. Then FFMNet is split into two parts, which run on a mobile device and an edge server respectively. The feature generated by the mobile device is transmitted through the wireless channel to the edge server. To reduce the transmission overhead of the intermediate feature, a deep JSCC network is designed. By combining two networks together, the whole model achieves 512\u00d7 compression for the intermediate feature and a performance loss within 2% on both tasks. At last, by training with noise, the FFMNet with JSCC is robust to various channel conditions and outperforms the separate source and channel coding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3113827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09541059.pdf","startPage":"1973","endPage":"1977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3113827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Multi-Task Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541059/","displayDocTitle":"Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Multi-Task Network","volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9541059/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61972115 and 61872116"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Multi-Task Network","sourcePdf":"lsp-fan-3113827-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050545S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9541059","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":9541060,"authors":[{"name":"Haotian Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9591458/9541060/wu-3113873-small.gif","p":["Haotian Wu received the BSc and MSc degrees in computer science from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2015 and 2018, respectively.

Direct queries on the blockchain take much time by searching every block, while indirect queries on a blockchain database greatly degrade the authenticity of query results. To conquer the authenticity problem, we propose a Verifiable Query Layer (VQL) that can be deployed in the cloud to provide both efficient and verifiable data query services for blockchain systems. The middleware layer extracts data from the underlying blockchain system and efficiently reorganizes them in databases. To prevent falsified data from being stored in the middleware, a cryptographic fingerprint is calculated based on each constructed database. The database fingerprint will be first verified by miners and then written into the blockchain. Moreover, public users can verify the entire databases or several databases that interest them in the middleware layer. We implement VQL together with the verification schemes and conduct extensive experiments based on a practical blockchain system. The evaluation results demonstrate that VQL can efficiently support various data query services and guarantee the authenticity of query results for blockchain systems.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3113873","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9591458/09541060.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3113873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591458","startPage":"1393","endPage":"1406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VQL: Efficient and Verifiable Cloud Query Services for Blockchain Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"VQL: Efficient and Verifiable Cloud Query Services for Blockchain Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541060/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","publicationDate":"1 June 2022","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9541060/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"HK RGC GRF","grantNumber":"PolyU 15217321 and PolyU 15216220"},{"fundingName":"HK ITF","grantNumber":"ITS/081/18"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100021171","fundingName":"Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2020A1515111070"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VQL: Efficient and Verifiable Cloud Query Services for Blockchain Systems","sourcePdf":"tpds-xiao-3113873-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103725S","chronDate":"June 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9591458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9591458","articleId":"9541060","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9541076,"authors":[{"name":"Paul M.

Due to this latter constraint, the design problem is an NP-hard quadratic program with discrete variables, and hence, is difficult to solve. In this paper, we tackle this difficulty by reformulating the problem in several steps into an equivalent continuous-domain biconvex form, including equivalent representations for discrete and binary constraints. Our final biconvex reformulation is obtained via an exact penalty approach and can efficiently be solved using a standard cyclic block coordinate descent algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the proposed finite-alphabet precoding design for DACs with different resolutions, where it is shown that employing low-resolution DACs can lead to higher power efficiencies. In particular, we focus on a setup with one-bit DACs and show through simulation results that compared to the existing schemes, the proposed design can achieve SNR gains of up to 2\u00a0dB. We further provide analytic and numerical analyses of complexity and show that our proposed algorithm is computationally efficient as it typically needs only a few tens of iterations to converge.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3113803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09541078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3113803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","startPage":"5595","endPage":"5610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Alphabet Symbol-Level Multiuser Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO Downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Alphabet Symbol-Level Multiuser Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO Downlink","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541078/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9541078/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Luxembourg National Research Fund"},{"fundingName":"CORE Junior Project","grantNumber":"C16/IS/11332341"},{"fundingName":"Enhanced Signal Space opTImization for satellite comMunication Systems","grantNumber":"FNR/INTER/MOBILITY/18/129551588/QOE-WiC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Alphabet Symbol-Level Multiuser Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO Downlink","sourcePdf":"tsp-haqiqatnejad-3113803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124263S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9541078","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9541103,"authors":[{"name":"Harjeevan Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chandigarh University, Mohali, India"],"firstName":"Harjeevan","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085767464"},{"name":"Nitin Mittal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chandigarh University, Mohali, India"],"firstName":"Nitin","lastName":"Mittal","orcid":"0000-0003-0758-2755","id":"37085799181"},{"name":"Rajan Miglani","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, India"],"firstName":"Rajan","lastName":"Miglani","orcid":"0000-0001-5836-6548","id":"37085634479"},{"name":"Harbinder Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chandigarh University, Mohali, India"],"firstName":"Harbinder","lastName":"Singh","id":"37088763215"},{"name":"Gurjot Singh Gaba","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, Ben Guerir, Morocco"],"firstName":"Gurjot Singh","lastName":"Gaba","id":"38241343700"},{"name":"Mustapha Hedabou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, Ben Guerir, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mustapha","lastName":"Hedabou","id":"37085420370"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"9541103","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"IEEE Plagiarism Policy","type":"graphic","fileSize":"","file":"/ielx7/4563994/9536215/9541103/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-3113650.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/9536215/9541103/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-3113650.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","High-speed optical techniques","5G mobile communication","Adaptive optics","Optical signal processing","Bandwidth","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free space optical communication","fifth generation networks","meteorological effects","OFDM","WDM","digital signal processing","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"Free space optical (FSO) communication has established a reputation for itself as a next-generation network capable of delivering high-speed data services.

A novel approach is proposed to effectively deal with the joint effects from fuzzy rules and reaction-diffusion terms for the class of T-S fuzzy fractional-order reaction-diffusion delayed quaternion-valued neural networks (FORDDQVNNs) under consideration. By employing Lyapunov stability theory, Caputo fractional derivative, several algebraic criteria are established to guarantee the FTMLS of T-S fuzzy FORDDQVNNs via designed fuzzy feedback controller. Moreover, the adaptive controller and parameter update laws are designed via adaptive control methods. Compared with existing results in the literature, we also show that our results are less conservative than existing ones with these illustrative T-S fuzzy FORDDQVNNs. A numerical example is presented to verify the analysis results and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed FTMLS conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9541153/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Feedback Controller Design for Finite-Time Mittag-Leffler Synchronization of Fractional-Order Quaternion-Valued Reaction-Diffusion Fuzzy Molecular Modeling of Delayed Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Rajamangala University of Technology Suvarnabhumi"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Adaptive Fuzzy Feedback Controller Design for Finite-Time Mittag-Leffler Synchronization of Fractional-Order Quaternion-Valued Reaction-Diffusion Fuzzy Molecular Modeling of Delayed Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-boonsatit-3113915-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146483S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9541153","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9541155,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Nie","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9541155/nie-3113942-small.gif","p":["Shuai Nie (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in telecommunications engineering from Xidian University in 2012, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from New York University in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2021.

These advantages and the ultra-wide spectrum availability in the Terahertz (THz) band enable profound potentials for inter-satellite links (ISLs) to achieve ultra-high throughput in both near-Earth and deep-space orbits. In this paper, the ISL channels at THz band are characterized and their link capacity is analyzed. First, the propagation channel effects in both Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere and deep space are investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of THz band for ISLs. Second, an orbital perturbation model for satellite formation flying is proposed and analyzed with actual ephemeris information. Finally, a channel model is developed to investigate the diversity in both polarization and frequency domain for THz band inter-small-satellite communications. Our numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the ionospheric plasma does not affect the THz band signal propagation in near-Earth orbits; 2) the beam misalignment loss can be characterized by orbital perturbation factors; and 3) the ISLs in THz band can utilize the diversity techniques to achieve high throughput in both near-Earth and deep-space links.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113942","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09541155.pdf","startPage":"8585","endPage":"8599","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Modeling and Analysis of Inter-Small-Satellite Links in Terahertz Band Space Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Channel Modeling and Analysis of Inter-Small-Satellite Links in Terahertz Band Space Networks","volume":"69","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9541155/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Modeling and Analysis of Inter-Small-Satellite Links in Terahertz Band Space Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-nie-3113942-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123668S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9541155","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9541156,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China","CETC Key Laboratory of Data Link Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9541156/li-3113909-small.gif","p":["Tong Li (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electronic information engineering from Chang\u2019an University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2020, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering.

How to ensure the availability of time slots in high dynamic scenarios and the rationality and robustness of power allocation in massive scenarios remains to be resolved. In this paper, we propose a robust mean field game (MFG) framework to manage time slot resources and power resources. On the one hand, this framework can predict the potential conflicts of time slots and avoid them in time. On the other hand, it can well adapt to the massive scenarios with complex interference, in order to realize power control. The simulation results show that the robust MFG-based resource management scheme can not only reduce the probability of packet collision and packet loss, but also improve communication energy efficiency (EE) with better robustness.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09541156.pdf","startPage":"130649","endPage":"130664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power Control and Scheduling for High-Dynamic Multi-Hop UAV Communication: A Robust Mean Field Game","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541156/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power Control and Scheduling for High-Dynamic Multi-Hop UAV Communication: A Robust Mean Field Game","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9541156/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100015251","fundingName":"China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) Key Laboratory of Data Link Technology","grantNumber":"CLDL-20202314 and CLDL-20182308"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-2128368 and CNS-2107216"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004405","fundingName":"Toyota Motor Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Power Control and Scheduling for High-Dynamic Multi-Hop UAV Communication: A Robust Mean Field Game","sourcePdf":"access-li-3113909-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131238S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9541156","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9541162,"authors":[{"name":"Zulqurnain Sabir","affiliation":["Hazara University, Mansehra, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9541162/sabir-3113986-small.gif","p":["Zulqurnain Sabir received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from Punjab University, Lahore, Pakistan, and the M.Phil. degree in mathematics from Preston University Kohat, Islamabad Campus, Pakistan.

Further, routing and spectrum access are typically treated as separate tasks. Moreover, the optimization objective is usually a cumulative metric along the route, e.g., number of hops or delay. In this paper, we account for the physical-layer signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a wireless network and further show that \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">bottleneck</i>\n objective such as the minimum SINR along the route can also be optimized effectively using reinforcement learning.

The agent is trained according to the physical-layer characteristics of the environment using a novel rewarding scheme based on the Monte Carlo estimation of the future bottleneck SINR. It learns to avoid interference by intelligently making joint routing and spectrum allocation decisions based on the geographical location information of the neighbouring nodes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113948","startPage":"8200","endPage":"8213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09541168.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Routing and Spectrum Access in Physical Layer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541168/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Routing and Spectrum Access in Physical Layer","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9541168/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Routing and Spectrum Access in Physical Layer","sourcePdf":"tcomm-cui-3113948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080467S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9541168","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9541170,"authors":[{"name":"Chryssalenia Koumpouzi","affiliation":["Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Chryssalenia","lastName":"Koumpouzi","orcid":"0000-0001-6882-3781","id":"37086344772"},{"name":"Predrag Spasojevi\u0107","affiliation":["Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA","WINLAB, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Predrag","lastName":"Spasojevi\u0107","id":"37282992100"},{"name":"Fikadu T.

In addition to synchronization issues, and especially in military settings, security from the aspect of detectability is also of crucial importance. Imperfect synchronization can be dealt with by making use of Quasi-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (QS-CDMA), relying on Loosely Synchronous Codes to maintain orthogonality in the presence of limited time delays. Security, in terms of low probability of detection (LPD) from the standpoint of a malicious adversary, can be improved (reduced detection) by employing randomization techniques that disrupt the inherent structure of the transmitted QS-CDMA signals. This is based on the fact that QS-CDMA signals are Cyclostationary, having (almost) periodic Auto-Correlation functions (ACF) due to eminent signal periodicities (such as spreading code repetition). In this paper, we propose techniques to disturb the ACF and equivalently the Spectral Correlation function, and reduce the Degree of Cyclostationarity (DCS), our LPD measure. Specifically, we investigate randomization via 1) random per symbol time dithering and 2) random selection of spreading sequences, as well as a hybrid approach combining time dithering and code randomization. In all proposed techniques knowledge of the randomization pattern is not required at the legitimate receiver. We derive the Spectral Correlation function of the QS-CDMA signal under the proposed randomization schemes and compare it to simulations. We show through analysis and extensive numerical simulations that the proposed technique can reduce the DCS by almost two orders of magnitude. We also show that enhanced LPD can be achieved using the proposed techniques while sacrificing a part of the reduced time synchronization requirement. We further analyze the implications of the friendly receiver not knowing the randomization pattern and present results on the resulting communication performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2021.3114065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/9151439/09541170.pdf","startPage":"4762","endPage":"4771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2021.3114065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9151439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved LPD Characteristics for QS-DS-CDMA Employing Randomization Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541170/","displayDocTitle":"Improved LPD Characteristics for QS-DS-CDMA Employing Randomization Techniques","volume":"16","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9541170/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"U.S. Army Research Laboratory"},{"fundingName":"ARO/ARL","grantNumber":"W911NF-19-1-0082"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved LPD Characteristics for QS-DS-CDMA Employing Randomization Techniques","sourcePdf":"tifs-koumpouzi-3114065-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132195S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"9151439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","xplore-issue":"9151439","articleId":"9541170","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9541171,"authors":[{"name":"David Gamarnik","affiliation":["Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["David Gamarnik received the B.A. degree in mathematics from New York University (NYU) in 1993 and the Ph.D. degree in operations research from MIT in 1998.","Since then, he was a Research Staff Member of IBM T.

Traditionally, the secret data is converted into binary bits and the cover image is manipulated statistically to embed the secret binary bits. Overloading the cover image may lead to distortions and the secret information may become visible. Hence the hiding capacity of the traditional methods are limited. In this paper, a light-weight yet simple deep convolutional autoencoder architecture is proposed to embed a secret image inside a cover image as well as to extract the embedded secret image from the stego image. The proposed method is evaluated using three datasets - COCO, CelebA and ImageNet. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, hiding capacity and imperceptibility results on the test set are used to measure the performance. The proposed method has been evaluated using various images including Lena, airplane, baboon and peppers and compared against other traditional image steganography methods. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method has higher hiding capacity, security and robustness, and imperceptibility performances than other deep learning image steganography methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09541180.pdf","startPage":"135585","endPage":"135593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-End Image Steganography Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"End-to-End Image Steganography Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoders","htmlLink":"/document/9541180/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Qatar National Library"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"End-to-End Image Steganography Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoders","sourcePdf":"access-bouridane-3113953-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141923S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9541180","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9541182,"authors":[{"name":"Ertugrul Basar","affiliation":["Communications Research and Innovation Laboratory (CoreLab), Ko\u00e7 University, Sariyer, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9541182/basar-3113954-small.gif","p":["Ertugrul Basar (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree from Istanbul Technical University in 2013.

This paper aims to fill an important gap in the open literature by providing a physical, accurate, open-source, and widely applicable RIS channel model for mmWave frequencies. Our model is not only applicable in various indoor and outdoor environments but also includes the physical characteristics of wireless propagation in the presence of RISs by considering 5G radio channel conditions. Various deployment scenarios are presented for RISs and useful insights are provided for system designers from the perspective of potential RIS use-cases and their efficient positioning.

Monitoring their safety and automatically identifying and locating third-party damage events are crucial to energy supply. However, most traditional methods lack in-depth consideration of distributed fiber signals and have not been tested on real-world long-distance pipelines, making it difficult to deploy them in operating long-distance pipelines. In this study, we utilize a novel real-time machine-learning method based on phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometer technology to monitor the safety of oil and gas pipelines. Specifically, we build a multifeature-fusion convolutional neural network and LightGBM fusion model based on two novel complementary spatiotemporal features. The method was applied to a large amount of data collected from real-world oil\u2013gas transportation pipelines of the China National Petroleum Corporation. The proposed method could accurately locate and identify third-party damage events in real-time under conditions of strong noise and various types of system hardware, and could effectively handle signal drift in the time and space dimensions. Our methodology has been deployed at real long-distance energy pipeline sites and our work will contribute to energy pipeline safety and energy supply security. Furthermore, the proposed solution could be generalized to other fields, such as industrial inspection, measurement, and monitoring.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09541184.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipeline Safety Early Warning by Multifeature-Fusion CNN and LightGBM Analysis of Signals From Distributed Optical Fiber Sensors","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3092518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3092518","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541184/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Pipeline Safety Early Warning by Multifeature-Fusion CNN and LightGBM Analysis of Signals From Distributed Optical Fiber Sensors","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2021","externalId":"2514213","publicationDate":"2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9541184/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002886","fundingName":"Pipeline Branch of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)","grantNumber":"GDGS-2020-JS-24"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipeline Safety Early Warning by Multifeature-Fusion CNN and LightGBM Analysis of Signals From Distributed Optical Fiber Sensors","sourcePdf":"tim-li-3092518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111128S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9541184","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":9541189,"authors":[{"name":"Bing L\u00fc","affiliation":["College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9541189/lu-3113988-small.gif","p":["Bing L\u00fc received the B.Sc. degree in agronomy, the M.Sc. degree in plant physiology, and the Ph.D. degree in crop genetics and breeding from Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China, in 1996, 1999, and 2007, respectively.

By using the function approximation capability of neural networks, a neural-networks-based gene circuit control method is designed, where the unknown sensor faults are compensated. Comparing with the existing results where regulatory functions meet known SUM logic, the regulatory functions considered in this article are unknown and do not satisfy SUM logic. Furthermore, the fault negative influence on neural network function approximation, which is caused by state sensor faults, has been compensated. In sense of Lyapunov stability theory, the closed-loop system is asymptotically bounded and all the signals in the system converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin. Finally, some simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the design method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9541189/","displayDocTitle":"NNs-Based Adaptive Control for Genetic Regulatory Networks With Sensor Faults","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61873229 and 61473250"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"NNs-Based Adaptive Control for Genetic Regulatory Networks With Sensor Faults","sourcePdf":"access-shen-3113988-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075503S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9541189","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9541191,"authors":[{"name":"Henrique K.

However, during this period, people must take precautions for safety purposes. One of the essential steps towards eliminating or reducing the effect of COVID-19 is maintaining social distancing while in public places. Some people are neglecting the social distancing norms while on the move. Still, no surveillance system exists, which monitors the people\u2019s movement for social distancing and securely & efficiently shares the information with the concerned administration department. There also exists no penalty system which forces the people to ensure social distancing. Motivated from the aforementioned facts, in this paper, we present a blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)-envisioned scheme for monitoring social distancing to combat COVID-19 situations. The proposed scheme uses fast region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN) and you only look once (YOLO) models for the object (i.e., human) detection through the live video feed captured from the static CCTV cameras as well as lens-equipped drones. Further, the efficient euclidean distance calculation is embedded for calculating the distance between two humans. Blockchain technology ensures the secure and trusted exchange of information between the entities at the physical layer and the administration departments. Blockchain wallets are also used to pay the fine when people do not follow social distance norms. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated based on three broad parameters such as (i) human detection and violation identification, (ii) blockchain simulation and analysis, and (iii) network performance comparison. The parameters considered for (i) is confidence score, for (ii) are scalability, hash rate, and simulation interface, and for (iii) are network bandwidth, throughput, packet loss rate, and network latency. By analyzing all the parameters mentioned above, we observe the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09541193.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"129830","endPage":"129840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blockchain and AI-Empowered Social Distancing Scheme to Combat COVID-19 Situations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blockchain and AI-Empowered Social Distancing Scheme to Combat COVID-19 Situations","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9541193/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Blockchain and AI-Empowered Social Distancing Scheme to Combat COVID-19 Situations","sourcePdf":"access-tanwar-3114098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154891S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9541193","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9541195,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Schl\u00fcter","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, SFB 912 HAEC, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9541195/schlu-3113946-small.gif","p":["Martin Schl\u00fcter received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in information systems engineering from Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Vodafone Chair Mobile Communication Systems.

However, since 1-bit quantization is a highly non-linear operation, standard off the shelf receiver algorithms cannot be applied. In this paper we consider an unknown phase rotation and timing offset and a fully digital receiver. To reduce the non-linear behavior introduced by 1-bit quantization, we assume that the receiver applies uniform phase and sample dithering, which can be implemented by sampling at an irrational normalized intermediate frequency and with an irrational oversampling factor, respectively. Based on the least squares objective function we derive a typical digital matched filter receiver with a data- and timing-aided phase estimator and square time recovery based timing estimation. Our main contribution is to show that both estimators are consistent under very general assumptions, e.g., arbitrary colored noise and stationary ergodic transmit symbols. Performance evaluations are done via simulations and are compared against a numerically computable upper bound of the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound. For low signal-to-noise ratio the estimators perform well but for high signal-to-noise ratio they run into an error floor. The performance loss of the phase estimator due to decision-directed operation or estimated timing information is marginal.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09541195.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3113946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Joint Phase and Timing Estimation With 1-Bit Quantization and Oversampling","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9541195/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541195/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) in the Collaborative Research Center \u201cHighly Adaptive Energy-Efficient Computing\u201d, SFB 912, HAEC","grantNumber":"164481002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Phase and Timing Estimation With 1-Bit Quantization and Oversampling","sourcePdf":"tcomm-schluter-3113946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156703S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9541195","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9541201,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, Shenzhen, China","Pazhou Lab, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1112-057X"},{"name":"Zhitang Chen","affiliation":["Noah\u2019s Ark Laboratory, Huawei Technologies Company Ltd., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhitang","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Guochen Liu","affiliation":["Noah\u2019s Ark Laboratory, Huawei Technologies Company Ltd., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Guochen","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Yik-Chung Wu","affiliation":["The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yik-Chung","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-2738-0387"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["University College London, London, U.K"],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","orcid":"0000-0001-7521-0078"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9541201","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polar codes","Codes","Decoding","Neural networks","Optimization","Reliability","Transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nested polar codes","learning to optimize","neural networks","attention mechanism"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Construct Nested Polar Codes: An Attention-Based Set-to-Element Model","abstract":"As capacity-achieving codes under successive cancellation (SC) decoding, nested polar codes have been adopted in 5G enhanced mobile broadband. To optimize the performance of the code construction under practical decoding, e.g. SC list (SCL) decoding, artificial intelligence based methods have been explored in the literature. However, the structure of nested polar codes has not been fully exploited for code construction. To address this issue, this letter transforms the original combinatorial optimization problem for the construction of nested polar codes into a policy optimization problem for sequential decision, and proposes an attention-based set-to-element model, which incorporates the nested structure into the policy design. Based on the proposed architecture for the policy, a gradient based algorithm for code construction and a divide-and-conquer strategy for parallel implementation are further developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed construction outperforms the state-of-the-art nested polar codes for SCL decoding.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3114118","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3114118","startPage":"3898","endPage":"3902","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09541201.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541201/","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Construct Nested Polar Codes: An Attention-Based Set-to-Element Model","volume":"25","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9541201/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62101349"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Construct Nested Polar Codes: An Attention-Based Set-to-Element Model","sourcePdf":"lcomm-li-3114118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058907S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9541201","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9541211,"authors":[{"name":"Nancy M.

In the welding robot laser vision system discussed in this article, traditional structured light and hand\u2013eye calibration methods are complex and time consuming.

To solve the above problems, a calibration optimization method for the welding robot laser vision system based on the generative adversarial network is proposed in this article. By establishing an accurate calibration model, the calibration process is transformed into an optimization problem for the calibration parameters. An efficient and intelligent collection method is adopted to provide accurate, diverse, and sufficient calibration data for the calibration optimization method. The experimental results verify that the proposed method greatly improves the efficiency of calibration data collection. The reference point positioning experiment demonstrates that our method has low uncertainty in point positioning.

The impact of delay constraints may lead to rejection of demands, resulting in low resource utilization of network resources. This is especially severe when dynamic traffic is considered. Therefore, intelligent resource allocation algorithms are required to use the network resources in delay constrained scenario efficiently. Moreover, these algorithms should guarantee quality of service (QoS) between different priority slices during congestion case. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of delay constraint on the performance of an online resource allocation algorithm based on an intelligent efficient squatting and kicking model (SKM), proved in other works to be the most effective up to the present time yet. SKM incorporates kicking and squatting of resources as innovative techniques enabling it to achieve 100% resource utilization and acceptance ratio for higher priority slices in scenarios where the other state of art algorithms not able to reach by far in some scenarios. Simulation results showed that incorporating delay constraints has a significant impact on the performance, resulting in up to 10% and 4% reduction in terms of average resource utilization and acceptance ratios respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2021","volume":"23","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the impact of delay constraints in network services for intelligent network slicing based on SKM model","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Evaluating the impact of delay constraints in network services for intelligent network slicing based on SKM model","sourcePdf":"6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028118S","chronDate":"Aug.  2021","isNumber":"9541326","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","articleId":"9541328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":9541336,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwei Wu","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of IoT Information Technology, School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou"],"firstName":"Zhiwei","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Zilin Yang","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of IoT Information Technology, School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou"],"firstName":"Zilin","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Chao Yang","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of IoT Information Technology, School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Jixu Lin","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of IoT Information Technology, School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou"],"firstName":"Jixu","lastName":"Lin"},{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of IoT Information Technology, School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Xin Chen","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of IoT Information Technology, School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Chen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"9541336","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Servers","Task analysis","Turning","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Roads","Edge computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep reinforcement learning","energy efficiency","mobile edge computing","unmanned aerial vehicle relay"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541336","abstract":"As the general mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme cannot adequately handle the emergency communication requirements in vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular edge computing networks (VECNs) are envisioned as the reliable and cost-efficient paradigm for the mobility and flexibility of UAVs. UAVs can perform as the temporary base stations to provide edge services for road vehicles with heavy traffic. However, it takes a long time and huge energy consumption for the UAV to fly from the stay charging station to the mission areas disorderly. In this paper, we design a pre-dispatch UAV-assisted VECNs system to cope with the demand of vehicles in multiple traffic jams. We propose an optimal UAV flight trajectory algorithm based on the traffic situation awareness. The cloud computing center (CCC) server predicts the real-time traffic conditions, and assigns UAVs to different mission areas periodically. Then, a flight trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize the cost of UAVs, while both the UAV flying and turning energy costs are mainly considered. In addition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning(DRL)-based energy efficiency autonomous deployment strategy, to obtain the optimal hovering position of UAV at each assigned mission area. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can obtain an optimal flight path and deployment of UAV with lower energy consumption.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8697897","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/8697897/09541336.pdf","doi":"10.23919/JCN.2021.000026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCN.2021.000026","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint deployment and trajectory optimization in UAV-assisted vehicular edge computing networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541336/","displayDocTitle":"Joint deployment and trajectory optimization in UAV-assisted vehicular edge computing networks","isOpenAccess":true,"isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint deployment and trajectory optimization in UAV-assisted vehicular edge computing networks","sourcePdf":"1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042133S","isNumber":"8697897","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","articleId":"9541336","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":9541338,"authors":[{"name":"Dung Nguyen Quoc","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Electronic Science and Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China, and with HaTinh University, HaTinh 480000, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Dung Nguyen","lastName":"Quoc"},{"name":"Niansheng Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Engineering, Jimei University, Xiamen 361021, China"],"firstName":"Niansheng","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Donghui Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Electronic Science and Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China"],"firstName":"Donghui","lastName":"Guo"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"9541338","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541338","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerant systems","Fault tolerance","Wireless sensor networks","Routing","Energy consumption","Routing protocols","Network topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering","fault-tolerance","Gaussian network","multi-path routing","wireless sensor network"]}],"doi":"10.23919/JCN.2021.000028","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/8697897/09541338.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCN.2021.000028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8697897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid fault-tolerant routing based on Gaussian network for wireless sensor network","abstract":"In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid fault-tolerant routing to solve fault-tolerant issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based on hierarchical topology. The hierarchical topology is a combination of clustering and the labeling of sensor nodes as Gaussian integers. Accordingly, the network area is divided into small square grids, the cluster head of each grid is represented by a Gaussian integer. These cluster heads are connected together to create a Gaussian network. Through node symmetry, and the shortest distance in the Gaussian network, as well as the advantages of multi-path routing, this paper proposes a hybrid fault-tolerant clustering routing protocol based on Gaussian network for wireless sensor network (FCGW). The purpose of FCGW is to improve fault tolerance, increase data reliability and reduce energy consumption for wireless sensor networks. The experimental results of the proposed scheme show that FCGW protocol has high data reliability. In addition, the FCGW protocol consumes about 48% of the energy in the network, while other protocols consume 70% more energy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isEarlyAccess":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid fault-tolerant routing based on Gaussian network for wireless sensor network","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A hybrid fault-tolerant routing based on Gaussian network for wireless sensor network","sourcePdf":"3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015805S","isNumber":"8697897","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","articleId":"9541338","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":9541339,"authors":[{"name":"Shahzaib Tahir","affiliation":["Department of Information Security, College of Signals, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Shahzaib","lastName":"Tahir"},{"name":"Hasan Tahir","affiliation":["Department of Information Security, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Tahir"},{"name":"Ali Sajjad","affiliation":["British Telecommunications Plc, UK"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Sajjad"},{"name":"Muttukrishnan Rajarajan","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, City, University of London, UK"],"firstName":"Muttukrishnan","lastName":"Rajarajan"},{"name":"Fawad Khan","affiliation":["Department of Information Security, College of Signals, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Fawad","lastName":"Khan"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"9541339","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541339","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Medical services","Data privacy","Security","Blockchains","Privacy","Regulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coronavirus","Hyperledger Fabric","pandemic","searchable encryption"]}],"abstract":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has caused widespread panic and global initiatives are geared towards treatment and limiting its spread. With technological advancements, several mechanisms and mobile applications have been developed that attempt to trace the physical contact made by a person with someone who has been tested COVID-19 positive. While designing these apps, user's privacy has been an afterthought and has resulted in mass violations of privacy of the public and the patients. A total of 32 countries have designed apps and rely on them as a strategy to flatten the pandemic curve. Along with lack of privacy, these methodologies are centralized, where they are fully controlled by the government and the healthcare providers. Owing to these and many other concerns, people are hesitant in the adoption of these technologies. This paper presents a detailed analysis of user tracking apps belonging to 32 countries, thus demonstrating that they collect personal data and are a gross violation of user privacy. This paper presents a novel architecture for the efficient, effective and privacy-preserving contact tracing of COVID-19 patients using blockchain. The proposed architecture preserves the privacy of individuals and their contact history by encrypting all the data specific to an individual using a privacy-preserving Homomorphic encryption scheme and storing it on a permissioned blockchain network. The contacts made with a COVID-19 positive patient are identified by performing search queries directly over the Homomorphic encrypted data stored in the blocks. Therefore, only those contacts that are suspected to be COVID-19 positive may be decrypted by the healthcare professional or government for further contact tracing/diagnosis and COVID-19 testing; thereby leading to enhanced privacy.","doi":"10.23919/JCN.2021.000031","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/8697897/09541339.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCN.2021.000031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8697897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-preserving COVID-19 contact tracing using blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-preserving COVID-19 contact tracing using blockchain","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Privacy-preserving COVID-19 contact tracing using blockchain","sourcePdf":"4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016977S","isNumber":"8697897","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","articleId":"9541339","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":9541341,"authors":[{"name":"Long Ying","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9541341/ying-3114191-small.gif","p":["Long Ying received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in biomedical engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, in 2015.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China.

Employing only traditional application layer password authentication approaches cannot guarantee the security of the communication system. Therefore, it is critical to develop a capable and efficient radio frequency fingerprints based physical layer authentication system. To incorporate the domain knowledge in more capable feature extracting and reduce information loss caused by converting RF baseband I/Q signals, we propose a novel differential complex-valued convolutional neural network based individual recognition approach of communication radiation sources in the paper. The proposed method can fully capture the nonlinearity of the RF baseband I/Q signals while decreasing the unfavorable impact of phase rotation induced by carrier frequency offset, which also significantly reduces the required data length of the collected steady-state data transmission section. The recognition performance evaluation on 20 wireless network card devices with duplicate batch, type, and manufacturer shows that the proposed approach has the best recognition performance compared with two conventional approaches whose recognition accuracies are lower than 95%, achieving the total recognition accuracy of 99.7%. Moreover, compared with constellation based approaches, which require at least 5,000 to 10,000 data points as input parameters, the proposed method can reduce the required data length of the collected steady-state data transmission section effectively, which is easier to implement in practical applications.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09541341.pdf","startPage":"132533","endPage":"132540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114191","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Network-Based Individual Recognition of Communication Radiation Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Differential Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Network-Based Individual Recognition of Communication Radiation Sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541341/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9541341/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61902193 and 62076160"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Differential Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Network-Based Individual Recognition of Communication Radiation Sources","sourcePdf":"access-ying-3114191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102311S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9541341","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9541350,"authors":[{"name":"Anjana A.

An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a 1-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling for a Class of Continuous Markov Processes","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3114142","endPage":"7890","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9622121/09541353.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"7876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3114142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541353","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Markov processes","Process control","Codes","Technological innovation","Quantization (signal)","Distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Causal lossy source coding","sequential estimation","event-triggered sampling","zero-delay coding","rate-distortion theory","control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling for a Class of Continuous Markov Processes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"67","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9541353/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CCF-1751356 and CCF-1956386"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling for a Class of Continuous Markov Processes","sourcePdf":"tit-guo-3114142-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108478S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9622121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9622121","articleId":"9541353","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":9541355,"authors":[{"name":"Or Ordentlich","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Or Ordentlich (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc.

Opinions are shared openly and freely on social media, a process that provides a rich source for trend analyses. These analyses could be accomplished artificially by natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis. Those tasks are implemented initially using machine learning. Due to its accuracy in studying unstructured data, deep learning has been increasingly used as well. The gated recurrent unit (GRU) is a promising approach in textual analysis and exhibits large morphological variations. We propose two neural models, i.e., the stacked gated recurrent unit (SGRU) and stacked bidirectional gated recurrent unit (SBi-GRU), with word embedding to mine Arabic opinions. We also propose a new way of discarding stop words using automatic sentiment refinement (ASR) instead of using manually collected stop words or using low quality available Arabic stop words\u2019 lists. The performance of our proposed models is compared with that of long short-term memory (LSTM), the support vector machine (SVM), and the most recent pretrained Arabic bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (AraBERT). In addition, we compare our models\u2019 performance to that of an ensemble architecture of the abovementioned models to find the best model architecture for Arabic natural language processing (NLP). To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have applied either the unidirectional or bidirectional SGRU for Arabic sentiment classification. Furthermore, no ensemble models have been implemented from these architectures for the Arabic language. The results show that the six-layer SGRU stacking and five-layer SBi-GRU stacking achieve the highest accuracy and that the ensemble method outperforms all other models, with an accuracy exceeding 90%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21176053","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9541361/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sentiment Analysis Using Stacked Gated Recurrent Unit for Arabic Tweets","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002713","fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University through the Graduate Students Research Support Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sentiment Analysis Using Stacked Gated Recurrent Unit for Arabic Tweets","sourcePdf":"access-alhumoud-3114313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098236S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9541361","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9541364,"authors":[{"name":"Benyamin Kheradvar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Computer Engineering, K.

This formulation calculates the iso-disparity strip widths based on the parameters of the stereo camera setup (\n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>\n, height, tilt angle, and baseline of the cameras) used to capture the images. The proposed formulation was then statistically validated using the results achieved in the case of a bank of stereo image pairs with different stereo camera setup parameters. Validation of the proposed formulation was in the presence of the strip width imperfections that appear in reality, and were shown to be in the form of additive Gaussian noise. Using the formulation proposed for iso-disparity strip widths, the paper then introduces a novel approach for ground plane detection based on the concept of iso-disparity strips in disparity map images. To add to the robustness of the proposed procedure against strip width noise, Cumulative Moving Average (CMA) and a dynamic thresholding technique are used to find the width of the strips corresponding to the ground plane. According to experimental results for synthesized and captured datasets, while exhibiting sufficiently low false positive rates (1.38% and 5.83%), the proposed method detects the ground plane with average true positive rates of as high as 80% and 54% in 65 ms and 224 ms, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2021.3114214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/9594098/09541364.pdf","startPage":"24495","endPage":"24504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3114214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Detection of Ground Plane in Stereo Vision Systems Based on Iso-Disparity Strip Pattern","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541364/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Detection of Ground Plane in Stereo Vision Systems Based on Iso-Disparity Strip Pattern","volume":"21","issue":"21","publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9541364/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Detection of Ground Plane in Stereo Vision Systems Based on Iso-Disparity Strip Pattern","sourcePdf":"jsen-mousavinia-3114214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132663S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"9594098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","xplore-issue":"9594098","articleId":"9541364","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9541367,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Yan","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/9594098/9541367/yan-3114206-small.gif","p":["Jun Yan (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2012.

For protecting the source-relay and relay-destination transmission against an eavesdropper, cooperative jamming technique is employed. Particularly, in the first phase of each data transmission cycle, the remaining relays (except the selected relay) are used to transmit artificial noise on the eavesdropper, and cooperate with the selected relay to cancel interference components. In the second phase, trusted nodes that are near the destinations are employed to play a role as the cooperative jammers. For a fair performance comparison, we design a simple transmit power allocation for the transmitter and jammer nodes at the first and second phases.

High energy efficiency of 16 nJ/classification (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology: MNIST) is achieved due to the wired-logic architecture. Each neuron in the neural network consists of combinational circuits only, and all the neurons are implemented on an FPGA. Intermediate data are never stored in memory or registers and are transmitted to the output stage by passing through only neuron cells. The latency and power required for memory access can be minimized, enabling low power and high throughput operation. A critical technical issue is reducing hardware resources because all neurons need to be implemented on an FPGA, where hardware resources are limited. Two core technologies have been developed to minimize the required hardware resources: (1) A neural network with a small number of neurons in which weight values of all synapses are fixed to a common value, and (2) a small neuron cell circuit consisting of an adder and look-up table containing an activation function. By fixing all weight values to a certain common value, processing can be simplified from multiply-accumulate operations to just additions, and the hardware resources required for each neuron are minimized. An experiment with the MNIST dataset using a 28-nm FPGA confirmed power consumption of 0.16 W and latency per inference of 100 ns (16nJ/classification). With the same recognition accuracy, the power efficiency is 45.6 times higher than that of the conventional state-of-the-art binarized DNN accelerator with a digital ASIC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9541384/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 16 nJ/Classification FPGA-Based Wired-Logic DNN Accelerator Using Fixed-Weight Non-Linear Neural Net","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 16 nJ/Classification FPGA-Based Wired-Logic DNN Accelerator Using Fixed-Weight Non-Linear Neural Net","sourcePdf":"jetcas-kosuge-3114179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081808S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9541384","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9541392,"authors":[{"name":"Ken R.

These results shifted focus away from creating code-independent decoders, but recent low-latency communication applications necessitate relatively short codes, providing motivation to reconsider the development of universal decoders. We introduce a scheme for employing binarized symbol soft information within Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding, a universal hard detection decoder. We incorporate codebook-independent quantization of soft information to indicate demodulated symbols to be reliable or unreliable. We introduce two decoding algorithms: one identifies a conditional Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding; the other either reports a conditional ML decoding or an error. For random codebooks, we present error exponents and asymptotic complexity, and show benefits over hard detection. As empirical illustrations, we compare performance with majority logic decoding of Reed-Muller codes, with Berlekamp-Massey decoding of Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes, with CA-SCL decoding of CA-Polar codes, and establish the performance of Random Linear Codes, which require a universal decoder and offer a broader palette of code sizes and rates than traditional codes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09541392.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding With Symbol Reliability Information (SRGRAND)","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9541392/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541392/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding With Symbol Reliability Information (SRGRAND)","sourcePdf":"tcomm-medard-3114315-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14364S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9541392","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9541407,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Substantial wind power penetration is causing the replacement of conventional synchronous generators in several power systems. Variable speed wind machines traditionally do not contribute to frequency regulation without additional control strategy. As a result, a wind dominated power grid may have inadequate inertia and governor responsive reserve. In such situation, a large contingency may yield undesirable Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) and frequency deviation. To overcome this problem, deployment of ESS, namely, Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) can be a worthwhile solution. Since these devices are costly, their appropriate sizing and operational approach are crucial. Therefore, in this paper, analytical expressions are derived to find the minimum ratings of SMES and BESS. To this end, system frequency deviation, ROCOF, inertial response and governor response are taken into account. Also, a coordinated operational strategy is proposed to retain frequency response adequacy and minimize under-frequency load shedding where SMES is triggered when system ROCOF supersedes a certain limit and BESS is activated due to system frequency surpassing a preset threshold. The performance of the proposed strategy is explored in a low inertia network under substantial wind penetration considering several different wind penetration levels. Also, the results are validated against two existing approaches. Simulation results reveal that the proposed methodology considerably enhances the frequency response in various operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09541407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"129933","endPage":"129950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring the Utilization of Energy Storage Systems for Frequency Response Adequacy of a Low Inertia Power Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the Utilization of Energy Storage Systems for Frequency Response Adequacy of a Low Inertia Power Grid","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9541407/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Exploring the Utilization of Energy Storage Systems for Frequency Response Adequacy of a Low Inertia Power Grid","sourcePdf":"access-masood-3114216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135559S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9541407","onlineDate":"20 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9541410,"authors":[{"name":"Wanghua Wu","affiliation":["Samsung Semiconductor, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9625642/9541410/wu-3111134-small.gif","p":["Wanghua Wu (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2004, and the M.Sc.

This paper studies the coordinated optimal dispatch of the electric-thermal coupling system for the regional energy network at the park level. Aiming at economy and environmental protection, a multi-objective chaotic particle swarm algorithm is presented. The initial population and the search process are more traversable by population initialization method based on chaos generation, penalty-based overrun correction method, and chaotic search-based particle movement method, and the particles are not allowed to enter the infeasible domain. To achieve the coordinated optimal dispatch of the deep electric-thermal coupling \"source-load\" system in the park. The simulation results show that compared with other multi-objective optimization algorithms, this algorithm has better convergence performance, and the optimization results are significantly reduced in terms of power consumption, total maintenance cost and carbon dioxide emissions, so it can better solve the co-scheduling problem of the electric-thermal coupling system.","doi":"10.1109/PSGEC51302.2021.9541573","startPage":"194","endPage":"201","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Power System and Green Energy Conference (PSGEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9541542/9541559/09541573.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 Power System and Green Energy Conference (PSGEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSGEC51302.2021.9541573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9541559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Scheduling of Power-Thermal Coupled System in Park Based on Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Chaos","Costs","Sociology","Scheduling","Statistics","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution control","carbon compounds","Internet","particle swarm optimisation","power consumption","power engineering computing","power generation dispatch","power generation economics","power generation scheduling","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated optimal dispatch","electric-thermal coupling system","regional energy network","multiobjective chaotic particle swarm algorithm","population initialization method","chaotic search-based particle movement method","source-load system","multiobjective optimization algorithms","power-thermal coupled system","energy internet development","power substitution","multitime scale characteristics","energy scheduling strategies","heating mode","environmental protection","penalty-based overrun correction method","convergence performance","power consumption","total maintenance cost","carbon dioxide emissions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["integrated energy system","multi-objective optimization","demand side response","chaotic particle swarm optimization","collaborative scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Scheduling of Power-Thermal Coupled System in Park Based on Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9541573/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21136879","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Scheduling of Power-Thermal Coupled System in Park Based on Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"PID2021141869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105464S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9541542","isNumber":"9541559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9541542","xplore-issue":"9541559","articleId":"9541573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9541637,"authors":[{"name":"Egor Sedov","affiliation":["Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, UK","Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Egor","lastName":"Sedov","id":"37087320534"},{"name":"Jaroslaw Prilepsky","affiliation":["Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Jaroslaw","lastName":"Prilepsky","id":"37596677400"},{"name":"Igor Chekhovskoy","affiliation":["Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Chekhovskoy","id":"37086231239"},{"name":"Sergei Turitsyn","affiliation":["Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, UK","Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Sergei","lastName":"Turitsyn","id":"37279002600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1876-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4804-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9541637","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541637","abstract":"Nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) (also known in the mathematical and nonlinear science community as the inverse scattering transform [1] ) has recently attracted a great deal of attention in the context of optical transmission in fiber channels [2] , that can be approximated by the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Within the NFT-based\u00a8 transmission approach, we modulate the parameters of the nonlinear spectrum (NS) and generate the respective information signal in time domain using inverse NFT. Both discrete and continuous parts of NS can be used, here we focus on the continuous spectrum only. Then, the signal is launched into the fiber, and at the receiver we apply direct NFT to the received signal\u2019s to retrieve the information encoded in NS. In this work we demonstrate that the high-accuracy computation of the continuous NS can be performed by using artificial neural networks (NN). The NS of a given localized signal q ( t ) containing no solitonic (discrete) components is represented by the continuous complex-valued function r ( \u03be ) (the reflection coefficient) of the real spectral parameter \u03be , where the latter plays the role of nonlinear frequency. The signals in our work have been specifically pre-selected to ensure that they contain no discrete spectrum. In the time domain, considered (normalized) symbol is given as the sum of independent sub-carriers [3] : $q(t) = \\frac{1}{Q}\\sum\\nolimits_{k = 1}^M {{C_k}} {e^{i{\\omega _k}t}}f(t)$ where M is a number of frequency channels, \u03c9 k is a carrier frequency of the k -th channel, C k corresponds to the digital data in k -th channel, and T defines the symbol interval; f ( t ) is the return-to-zero carrier support waveform. To assess the quality of NN prediction, we use the following formula for the relative error: $\\eta (\\xi ) = \\frac{{\\left\\langle {\\left| {{r_{predicted{\\text{ }}}}(\\xi ) - {r_{actual{\\text{ }}}}(\\xi )} \\right|} \\right\\rangle }}{{\\left\\langle {\\left| {{r_{actual{\\text{ }}}}(\\xi )} \\right|} \\right\\rangle }}$ , where \u3008\u2022\u3009 denotes the mean over the spectral interval, the \"predicted\" and \"actual\" indices refer to the NN-predicted and precomputed values of the reflection coefficient r ( \u03be ), respectively.","doi":"10.1109/CLEO/Europe-EQEC52157.2021.9541637","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum

To fulfil this incessant growth a high network capacity and high data rate is required. This can only be met by the 5 th generation (5G) of mobile systems with millimetre-wave (mmW) frequencies (>28 GHz), where large bands of un-allocated spectrum are available [1] . A promising cost reduction approach for the implementation of 5G is to use the centralized or cloud radio access network (C-RAN) scenario. CRAN consists of a pool of baseband processing units (BBU) connected with remote radio units (RRU) by an optical fiber or mmW wireless link [2] . Further savings can be achieved by employing an analog radio over fiber (ARoF), a transmission method, where the mmW signal is generated at RRU by means of optical heterodyning (OH) [3] . OH is the promising technique used to generate low phase noise mmW signals. Amongst many approaches to OH, the use of optical frequency combs (OFCs) [4] enables a cost-efficient generation of multiple high quality RF signals simultaneously. This stems from the fact that an OFC consists of a number of tones with precise channel spacing and excellent phase correlation between them. However, the division of power of the laser across the multiple tones of the OFC, results in low output power per the individual tone. This issue is worsened by the insertion losses of passive demultiplexers and external modulators. We have recently demonstrated that this challenge can be overcome by employing an active demultiplexer [5] . Such a device can simultaneously filter, amplify and modulate the demultiplexed OFC tone. In this paper, we generate 60 GHz ARoF signals, using an OFC and two active demultiplexers, and transmit it over 40 km of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF), achiving BER below the hard decision (HD-) FEC limit of 3.8e-3.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Frequency Comb and Active Demultiplexer-enabled 60 GHz mmW ARoF Transmission using Directly Modulated 64-QAM UF-OFDM

Singular Value Decomposition Method Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Partial Discharge Denoising","abstract":"Deterioration of insulation materials caused by partial discharge is one of the important reasons for the failure of power equipment. The noise caused by the interference of the external electromagnetic environment seriously affects the accuracy of partial discharge detection. Aiming at the problem of partial discharge noise suppression, this paper proposed a partial discharge signal noise suppression method based on adaptive window singular value decomposition. This method first randomly generated a series of windows with different positions and lengths on the noisy partial discharge signal; Then singular value decomposition method was employed to denoise the signals in each window; Finally, the denoising index was chosen as the fitness function, through the particle swarm algorithm to obtain the optimal solution of the window position and length. The noise signals obtained by simulation and experiment were verified, and the method was compared with adaptive singular value decomposition, wavelet denoising, and other methods. The results showed that this method could achieve a better denoising effect.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541900/","accessionNumber":"21136864","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9541900/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Window Singular Value Decomposition Method Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Partial Discharge Denoising","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Window Singular Value Decomposition Method Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Partial Discharge Denoising","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"PID2021142166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071667S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9541542","isNumber":"9541559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9541542","xplore-issue":"9541559","articleId":"9541900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9541909,"authors":[{"name":"Suwan Wu","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, China"],"firstName":"Suwan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37088974604"},{"name":"Li Jia","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jia","id":"37416946200"},{"name":"Yining Liu","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, China"],"firstName":"Yining","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088975263"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9095-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9096-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9541909","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind energy","Wind speed","Noise reduction","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Wind power generation","Wind farms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power engineering computing","recurrent neural nets","signal denoising","time series","wavelet transforms","wind power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind energy forecasting","wind energy data processing","signal processing","weather conditions","time series","environmentally friendly new energy","wavelet denoising","applied wind power","multivariate LSTM","one-dimensional wind energy data","ultra-short-term wind energy prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multivariate LSTM","wind power prediction","wavelet denoising","time series"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541909","abstract":"Wind energy is a typical representative of environmentally friendly new energy. However, its huge randomness and suddenness have caused many harms and losses to the actual applied wind power. Therefore, predicting wind energy in advance and improving the prediction accuracy have become the top priority. Since the wind energy data is a kind of time series, LSTM model has excellent performance. Most researches are focused on one-dimensional wind energy data. This paper uses a multivariate LSTM model. In addition to weather conditions, the wind energy at the previous moment is included as one of the variables to establish a prediction model. The model built including the wind power at the last moment performed very well. This paper compares it with the prediction model that does not consider the wind power at the previous moment, and verifies its effectiveness.The innovation of this paper is that firstly, wavelet denoising, a signal processing method, is applied to wind energy data processing, and secondly, a multivariate LSTM model is used to forecast wind energy. Considering that wind energy is a time series, the wind energy at the previous moment is also introduced except wind speed and wind direction. Compared with the prediction model that does not include the wind energy at the previous moment, the accuracy is significantly improved.","doi":"10.1109/PSGEC51302.2021.9541909","pdfPath":"/iel7/9541542/9541559/09541909.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"447","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Power System and Green Energy Conference (PSGEC)","publicationTitle":"2021 Power System and Green Energy Conference (PSGEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSGEC51302.2021.9541909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9541559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-short-term wind energy prediction based on wavelet denoising and multivariate LSTM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9541909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-short-term wind energy prediction based on wavelet denoising and multivariate LSTM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","accessionNumber":"21136775","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9541909/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-short-term wind energy prediction based on wavelet denoising and multivariate LSTM","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"PID2021143396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051243S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9541542","isNumber":"9541559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9541542","xplore-issue":"9541559","articleId":"9541909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9541957,"authors":[{"name":"D.

DL's application to photonics is fundamentally different from traditional application domains as the optical response of any structure is precisely calculable. This implies that training dataset generation is entirely within the user's control. Until now, this freedom has seldom been judiciously exploited; researchers have resorted to random sampling for dataset generation. We present a study exploring efficient strategies for dataset generation considering the design of two-dimensional (2D) extended unit-cell [3] all-dielectric metagratings. Each extended unit cell consists of two non-overlapping elliptically-shaped nanoresonators whose positions, axes lengths, and axes orientation are free parameters ( Fig. 1 A ) and for the range of chosen wavelengths and periodicity can lead to nine reflection and nine transmission diffraction orders. The objective is to determine a small subset (by sampling from the set of all feasible geometries) to train a neural network ( Fig. 1 B ) adequately for good global predictability ( Fig 1 C ). Of several explored sampling strategies, the greedy algorithm and clustering (k-mean and k-medoid) algorithms [4] outperformed random sampling. The k-mean and k-medoid strategies outperformed greedy for larger sized subsets ( Fig. 1 D ). Our study will stimulate interest in dataset generation strategies, which are essential to broaden DL's applicability to situations where dataset generation is costly.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9541265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEO/Europe-EQEC52157.2021.9542078","publicationTitle":"2021 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9541543/9541265/09542078.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doi":"10.1109/CLEO/Europe-EQEC52157.2021.9542078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample-efficient dataset generation for Deep-Learning based inverse design of photonic nanostructures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Sample-efficient dataset generation for Deep-Learning based inverse design of photonic nanostructures","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9542078/","publicationDate":"21 June 2021","accessionNumber":"21160924","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542078/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample-efficient dataset generation for Deep-Learning based inverse design of photonic nanostructures","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"jsiv-5-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038362S","chronDate":"21-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9541543","isNumber":"9541265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9541543","xplore-issue":"9541265","articleId":"9542078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9542288,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Fan","affiliation":["State Grid ZheJiang HangZhou XiaoShan Power Supply Company, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Fan","id":"37088974318"},{"name":"Liguo Weng","affiliation":["State Grid ZheJiang HangZhou XiaoShan Power Supply Company, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liguo","lastName":"Weng","id":"37088597984"},{"name":"Bin Yu","affiliation":["State Grid ZheJiang HangZhou XiaoShan Power Supply Company, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37088974735"},{"name":"Xinglong Feng","affiliation":["State Grid ZheJiang HangZhou XiaoShan Power Supply Company, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xinglong","lastName":"Feng","id":"37088594881"},{"name":"Junliang Chen","affiliation":["ZheJiang ZhongXin Power Engineering Construction CO.,LTD, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Junliang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088974607"},{"name":"Ting Shou","affiliation":["State Grid ZheJiang HangZhou XiaoShan Power Supply Company, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Shou","id":"37088973894"},{"name":"Wei Qi","affiliation":["State Grid ZheJiang HangZhou XiaoShan Power Supply Company, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Qi","id":"37088973771"},{"name":"Dongju Wang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dongju","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085527686"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9095-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9096-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9542288","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Interval Judgment of Urban Distribution Grid Based on Edge Computing of Distribution Internet of Things","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Power System and Green Energy Conference (PSGEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9541542/9541559/09542288.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"2021 Power System and Green Energy Conference (PSGEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSGEC51302.2021.9542288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9541559","doi":"10.1109/PSGEC51302.2021.9542288","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Grounding","Switches","Power system stability","Real-time systems","Stability analysis","Topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","Distribution Grid","edge computing","Fault Diagnosis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9542288","abstract":"The emergence of the Internet of Things has promoted the development of the transmission and processing of information in the distribution grid.

Under this background, the edge computing model, which distributes the data computing tasks originally undertaken by the main station of distribution information network center among the host nodes of each edge computing node in the system, is proposed. The urban power distribution network, mainly in the form of switching stations and terminal structures, is suitable for management and organization by adopting edge computing mode. In this paper, a single-phase grounding fault diagnosis method for distribution grid, which is applied on the internal edge computing host of a switching station, is introduced. Whether there is a grounding fault in the management area and where the fault occurs are determined by comparing the difference of zero-sequence electrical quantity of multiple lines with the edge computing node host. The validity of the algorithm is verified by a real field experiment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9542288/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault Interval Judgment of Urban Distribution Grid Based on Edge Computing of Distribution Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Interval Judgment of Urban Distribution Grid Based on Edge Computing of Distribution Internet of Things","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"PID2021141787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065079S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9541542","isNumber":"9541559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9541542","xplore-issue":"9541559","articleId":"9542288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9542317,"authors":[{"name":"Oleg Sidelnikov","affiliation":["Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Oleg","lastName":"Sidelnikov","id":"37086517107"},{"name":"Alexey Redyuk","affiliation":["Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia","Federal Research Center for Information and Computational Technologies, Novosibirsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Redyuk","id":"37085449446"},{"name":"Stylianos Sygletos","affiliation":["Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Stylianos","lastName":"Sygletos","id":"37391407600"},{"name":"Mikhail Fedoruk","affiliation":["Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia","Federal Research Center for Information and Computational Technologies, Novosibirsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Fedoruk","id":"37266738600"},{"name":"Sergei Turitsyn","affiliation":["Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia","Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Sergei","lastName":"Turitsyn","id":"37279002600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1876-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4804-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9542317","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Limiting","Nonlinear distortion","Neural networks","Europe","Optical fiber networks","Wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","nonlinear distortion","optical links","telecommunication computing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear transmission impairments","real-time implementation","deep neural networks","deep convolutional neural network","neural network layers","nonlinear distortion compensation","convolutional neural networks","multiple layers","nonlinearity mitigation","long-haul WDM transmission systems","fiber nonlinearity","optical fiber links","limiting factor","digital backward propagation method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9542317","abstract":"Overcoming fiber nonlinearity is one of the most challenging tasks in optical fiber links and it is a major limiting factor for extending their capacity.

The artificial intelligence models represented by neural network are widely used with the increasing demand of prediction accuracy. However, the potential characteristics of load series cannot be well captured based on single artificial intelligence model. To solve the problem, a CNN-LSTM hybrid model is proposed to further explore characteristics information contained in power load sequence. This model applies convolution layer of CNN to capture the features of power load data and makes power load forecasting using unique cellular structures of LSTM. This hybrid model is verified based on historical power load data acquired from Shanghai and Belgium. The prediction accuracy of CNN-LSTM outperforms other compared forecasting models after the observation of simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542404/","accessionNumber":"21136799","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9542404/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model Based Short-term Power Load Forecasting","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model Based Short-term Power Load Forecasting","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"PID2021143088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064642S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9541542","isNumber":"9541559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9541542","xplore-issue":"9541559","articleId":"9542404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9542526,"authors":[{"name":"Yujing Jia","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Guangxi Electric Power System Optimization and Energy\u2011Saving Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Yujing","lastName":"Jia","id":"37088974141"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Bai","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Guangxi Electric Power System Optimization and Energy\u2011Saving Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Bai","id":"37399921800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9095-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9096-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9542526","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulation","Distribution networks","Voltage","Predictive models","Power grids","Planning","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","convolutional neural network","optimal power flow"]}],"abstract":"The OPF problem for distribution networks is always a challenge in the operation or planning of power systems. The computational efficiency is crucial when solving the OPF problem. This paper develops a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) approach, named ConvOPF, to obtain optimal power flow for the distribution network. Firstly, a CNN is constructed and trained to learn the relationship between the load and the generations. Then, the voltage magnitude and phase angle are computed directly by using an AC power flow solver. This procedure significantly guarantees the power-flow balances and reduces the number of variables that the CNN model needs to predict. Therefore, the proposed ConvOPF can reduce unnecessary iterations and improve computational efficiency significantly. The experimental results of the 33-bus power grid verify the superiority of the proposed ConvOPF approach, which computing time can speed up significantly compared to the conventional iteration-based solvers.","doi":"10.1109/PSGEC51302.2021.9542526","publicationTitle":"2021 Power System and Green Energy Conference (PSGEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Power System and Green Energy Conference (PSGEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9541542/9541559/09542526.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSGEC51302.2021.9542526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9541559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9542526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CNN Approach for Optimal Power Flow Problem for Distribution Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542526/","displayDocTitle":"A CNN Approach for Optimal Power Flow Problem for Distribution Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9542526/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CNN Approach for Optimal Power Flow Problem for Distribution Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"PID2021146096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044005S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9541542","isNumber":"9541559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9541542","xplore-issue":"9541559","articleId":"9542526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9542639,"authors":[{"name":"Mingwei Yang","affiliation":["Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft-und Raumfahrt e.V.

Publications over the past few years prove that FLIER is a capable tool to produce effective photonic devices, such as waveguides [2] , tapers [3] , optical amplifiers and lasers [4] . One of the key features of FLIER technology is the addition of glass modifiers that play the role of refractive index carriers (typically La 2 O 3 or BaO) together with other rather lighter constituents acting as fast diffusing elements (such as Na 2 O or K 2 O). Fs-laser irradiation activates a micrometric area within the glass, inducing a temperature gradient that ultimately causes thermophoretic migration amongst the species composing the glass. This migration results in a refractive index contrast high enough to produce efficient waveguides. In this work, we present the application of FLIER technology upon modified silicate glasses and the in-depth characterization of the waveguiding structures produced.","doi":"10.1109/CLEO/Europe-EQEC52157.2021.9542718","publicationTitle":"2021 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9541543/9541265/09542718.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEO/Europe-EQEC52157.2021.9542718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9541265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Element Migration and Local Refractive Index Control in Silicate Glass by Femtosecond Laser Induced Element Redistribution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9542718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 June 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542718/","displayDocTitle":"Element Migration and Local Refractive Index Control in Silicate Glass by Femtosecond Laser Induced Element Redistribution","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"21 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9542718/","conferenceDate":"21-25 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Element Migration and Local Refractive Index Control in Silicate Glass by Femtosecond Laser Induced Element Redistribution","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"cm-p-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049257S","chronDate":"21-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9541543","isNumber":"9541265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9541543","xplore-issue":"9541265","articleId":"9542718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9542897,"authors":[{"name":"Septimiu Mischie","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics Telecommunications and Information Technologies, Politehnica University, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Septimiu","lastName":"Mischie","id":"37546449500"},{"name":"Gabriel Vasiu","affiliation":["Vitesco Technologies, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Vasiu","id":"37088976604"},{"name":"Robert Pazsitka","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics Telecommunications and Information Technologies, Politehnica University, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Pazsitka","id":"37085458624"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-80-261-0973-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3043-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1805-9597"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1803-7232"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1803-7232"}],"articleNumber":"9542897","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"abstract":"Teaching microcontrollers at university during face to face activities implies using development boards such as those from Texas Instruments or Microchip.

FPGA platforms show to be energy efficient but still slower than a graphics card in terms of performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics","Image processing","Neural networks","Graphics processing units","Life estimation","Tools","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Neural networks","Xilinx FPGA","Vitis AI","DPU"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9542900","doi":"10.23919/AE51540.2021.9542900","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Applied Electronics (AE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Applied Electronics (AE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9542848/9542868/09542900.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9542868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/AE51540.2021.9542900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542900/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Performance of Optimized HSI CNN models on Desktop and Embedded Platforms","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"7 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9542900/","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005280","fundingName":"Technical University of Liberec","grantNumber":"SGS-2019-3017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Performance of Optimized HSI CNN models on Desktop and Embedded Platforms","confLoc":"Pilsen, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"020_002_pid2021117284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076983S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9542848","isNumber":"9542868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9542848","xplore-issue":"9542868","articleId":"9542900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9542926,"authors":[{"name":"Li Xu","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8782712/8816720/9542926/xu-3113889-small.gif","p":["Li Xu (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in automation from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA, in 2016.

Wireless nodes common in IoT applications use sleep timers to synchronize with each other and enable heavy duty cycling of power-hungry communication blocks to reduce average power. 32kHz crystal oscillators remain the most popular choice for sleep timers thanks to their frequency stability, simplicity, and low cost. Because sleep timers must be always on, their power consumption must be low compared to the average power of wireless nodes. Meantime, 32kHz crystal oscillators must operate reliably under process, voltage, and temperature variations and exhibit good long-term stability, which make circuit design challenging considering their ultra-low power operation. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in ultra-low power 32kHz crystal oscillators. Fundamentals of crystal oscillators are introduced and analyzed from the perspective of power and frequency stability. Based on these fundamentals and analyses, existing design techniques of 32kHz crystal oscillators are discussed, highlighting the evolution of architectures in ultra-low power 32kHz crystal oscillators. Finally, research directions related to 32kHz crystal oscillators are introduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9542926/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Low Power 32kHz Crystal Oscillators: Fundamentals and Design Techniques","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Ultra-Low Power 32kHz Crystal Oscillators: Fundamentals and Design Techniques","sourcePdf":"ojsscs-xu-3113889-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082427S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782712","isNumber":"8816720","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782712","xplore-issue":"8816720","articleId":"9542926","onlineDate":"21 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":9542934,"authors":[{"name":"Shiwei Wang","affiliation":["imec, Leuven, Belgium","University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8782712/8816720/9542934/wang-3113887-small.gif","p":["Shiwei Wang (Senior Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree (Outstanding Honor) in electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from the University of Edinburgh, U.K., in 2014.

In this paper, we propose DyGA, a hardware-efficient GCN accelerator, which is featured by strategies of graph partitioning, customized storage policy, traffic-aware dynamic scheduling, and out-of-order execution. Synthesized and evaluated under TSMC 28-nm, the accelerator achieves an average throughput of over 95% of its peak performance with full utilization of hardware on representative graph data sets. Having a high area-efficiency with 0.217 GOPS/K-logic-gates and 8.06 GOPS/KB-PE-buffer, and thus an energy-efficiency of 384GOPS/W, the proposed accelerator outperforms previous state-of-the-art works in the sparse data processing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3112826","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3112826","startPage":"5095","endPage":"5107","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09542949.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9542949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542949/","displayDocTitle":"DyGA: A Hardware-Efficient Accelerator With Traffic-Aware Dynamic Scheduling for Graph Convolutional Networks","volume":"68","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9542949/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61934002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DyGA: A Hardware-Efficient Accelerator With Traffic-Aware Dynamic Scheduling for Graph Convolutional Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsi-han-3112826-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106064S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9542949","onlineDate":"21 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9542953,"authors":[{"name":"Yigi Kwon","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea","SIC Center, LG Electronics, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yigi","lastName":"Kwon","orcid":"0000-0001-6808-3015","id":"37088901568"},{"name":"Taewoong Kim","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taewoong","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0002-9874-1514","id":"37086039556"},{"name":"Nan Sun","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37088802937"},{"name":"Youngcheol Chae","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngcheol","lastName":"Chae","orcid":"0000-0002-1618-169X","id":"37274797400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-9603"}],"articleNumber":"9542953","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9542953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Transistors","Inverters","Power demand","Gain","Frequency measurement","Circuit stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","closed-loop dynamic amplifier","dynamic amplifier","pipelined SAR ADC","residue amplifier","successive approximation register (SAR) ADC"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a two-stage dynamic amplifier that achieves the high dc gain and PVT robustness of the residue amplifier in a pipelined successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC).

To find the best beam alignment, traditional exhaustive search scans all possible beam directions, thus introducing up to seconds of delay for wireless networks to accommodate mobile clients. In this letter, we propose a data-driven beam tracking approach to find the beamforming/combining vectors that achieve the target quality of service based on a series of equivalent dynamic linearization data models with a time-varying pseudo-gradient parameter estimation procedure. Unlike the model-based approach, which requires the prior knowledge about the channel and user mobility in beamforming design, the proposed data-driven approach depends only on the real-time measurement data. Numerical analyses show that the proposed data-driven beam tracking algorithm can achieve reliable tracking performance with much shorter alignment time compared to traditional schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2021.3113911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/9642026/09542965.pdf","startPage":"2747","endPage":"2751","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2021.3113911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Beam Tracking for Mobile Millimeter-Wave Communication Systems Without Channel Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Beam Tracking for Mobile Millimeter-Wave Communication Systems Without Channel Estimation","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9542965/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542965/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2019YFB1803305"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61901276"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China","grantNumber":"2020A1515010673"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for Science and Technology Innovation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"RCBS20200714114919307"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005023","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University","grantNumber":"RCS2021K009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Beam Tracking for Mobile Millimeter-Wave Communication Systems Without Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"lwc-quan-3113911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065784S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"9642026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","xplore-issue":"9642026","articleId":"9542965","onlineDate":"21 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9542966,"authors":[{"name":"Meiji Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, 07102, USA, and also with Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji university, Shanghai, 201804, China."],"firstName":"Meiji","lastName":"Cui"},{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji university, Shanghai, 201804, China."],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Mengchu Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, 07102, USA.

However, traditional evolutionary algorithms are not suitable to deal with high-dimensional expensive problems (HEPs) with high-dimensional search space even if their fitness evaluations are assisted by surrogate models. The recently proposed autoencoder-embedded evolutionary optimization (AEO) framework is highly appropriate to deal with high-dimensional problems. This work aims to incorporate surrogate models into it to further boost its performance, thus resulting in surrogate-assisted autoencoder-embedded evolutionary optimization (SAEO). It proposes a novel model management strategy that can guarantee reasonable amounts of re-evaluations, hence the accuracy of surrogate models can be enhanced via being updated with new evaluated samples. Moreover, to ensure enough data samples before constructing surrogates, a problem-dimensionality-dependent activation condition is developed for incorporating surrogates into the SAEO framework. SAEO is tested on seven commonly used benchmark functions and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms for HEPs. The experimental results show that SAEO can further enhance the performance of AEO on most cases and SAEO performs significantly better than other algorithms. Therefore, SAEO has great potential to deal with HEPs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isEarlyAccess":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Surrogate-assisted Autoencoder-embedded Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm to Solve High-dimensional Expensive Problems","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surrogate-assisted Autoencoder-embedded Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm to Solve High-dimensional Expensive Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-3113923-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044177S","isNumber":"4358751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","articleId":"9542966","onlineDate":"21 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":9542976,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Guo","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9542976/guo-3112672-small.gif","p":["Lei Guo (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China, in 2016.

The method allows the accurate calculation of both the diode power conversion efficiency (PCE) and matching efficiency, while showing the wide adaptability to frequency and input power. To calculate the diode PCE accurately, the junction voltage is built based on modeling the diode junction capacitance and turn-on voltage. Using the accurate diode PCE, the equivalent nonlinear resistance of the diode is calculated, and thus the diode impedance is obtained. This helps to design a matching network with required bandwidths and evaluate the corresponding matching efficiency. The total PCE of the RF power harvester is finally obtained by multiplying the diode PCE and matching efficiency. For verification, dual-band RF power harvesters based on diodes of SMS7630 and HSMS-2850 are developed to cover the two 5G frequency bands for three telecom operators in China (2.515-2.675, 3.4-3.5 & 3.5-3.6 GHz). They are designed to operate in the low power range of \u221225-\u22125 dBm for low power harvesting scenarios. Compared with the simulated results, the calculation discrepancy of less than 3.12% can be achieved in evaluating the total PCEs of the RF power harvesters. Prototypes of the designed RF power harvesters were fabricated and measured for validation. It shows that the proposed analytical method can provide design guidelines for developing a multi-band RF power harvester.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3112672","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3112672","startPage":"5194","endPage":"5205","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09542976.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9542976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542976/","displayDocTitle":"Accurately Modeling Zero-Bias Diode-Based RF Power Harvesters With Wide Adaptability to Frequency and Power","volume":"68","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9542976/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"62001081"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurately Modeling Zero-Bias Diode-Based RF Power Harvesters With Wide Adaptability to Frequency and Power","sourcePdf":"tcsi-guo-3112672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118136S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9542976","onlineDate":"21 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9542983,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of physical layer security in the networks that jointly use both technologies, named MaMIMO-CRN. Specifically, to investigate the vulnerability of this network, we design an optimized attacking scenario to MaMIMO-CRNs by a jammer. For having the most adversary effect on the uplink transmission of the legitimate MaMIMO-CRN, we propose an efficient method for power allocation of the jammer. The legitimate network consists of a training and a data transmission phase, and both of these phases are attacked by the jammer using an optimized power split between them. The resulting power allocation problem is non-convex. We thus propose three different efficient methods for solving this problem, and we show that under some assumptions, a closed-form solution can also be obtained. Our results show the vulnerability of the MaMIMO-CRN to an optimized jammer. It is also shown that increasing the number of antennas at the legitimate network does not improve the security of the network.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782661/9309127/09542983.pdf","startPage":"2219","endPage":"2231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","doi":"10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3114382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3114382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9309127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9542983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attacking Massive MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks by Optimized Jamming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Training","Resource management","Antennas","Uplink","Physical layer security","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","cognitive radio network","physical layer security","jamming","optimization","power allocation","spectral efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9542983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Attacking Massive MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks by Optimized Jamming","volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9542983/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Attacking Massive MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks by Optimized Jamming","sourcePdf":"ojcoms-razavizadeh-3114382-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108135S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782661","isNumber":"9309127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782661","xplore-issue":"9309127","articleId":"9542983","onlineDate":"21 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9543006,"authors":[{"name":"Shweta Dahale","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Shweta","lastName":"Dahale","id":"37086401519"},{"name":"Balasubramaniam Natarajan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Balasubramaniam","lastName":"Natarajan","id":"37278060200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4421-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4420-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4422-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2643-8798"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2643-878X"}],"articleNumber":"9543006","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Simulation","Conferences","Transforms","Minimization","Smart grids","Sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distribution system state estimation","matrix completion","compressive sensing","unobservability"]}],"abstract":"Limited measurement availability at the distribution grid presents challenges for state estimation and situational awareness.

The performance results reveal - (1) the superiority over traditional matrix completion and (2) very low state estimation errors for high compression ratios representing very low observability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Matrix Completion and Compressed Sensing for State Estimation in Low-observable Distribution System","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference - Latin America (ISGT Latin America)","doi":"10.1109/ISGTLatinAmerica52371.2021.9543006","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference - Latin America (ISGT Latin America)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9542989/9542990/09543006.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTLatinAmerica52371.2021.9543006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9542990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Joint Matrix Completion and Compressed Sensing for State Estimation in Low-observable Distribution System","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9543006/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"15 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-EE0008767"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006134","fundingName":"Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011883","fundingName":"Solar Energy Technologies Office"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Matrix Completion and Compressed Sensing for State Estimation in Low-observable Distribution System","confLoc":"Lima, Peru","sourcePdf":"paper_128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083385S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9542989","isNumber":"9542990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9542989","xplore-issue":"9542990","articleId":"9543006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":9543032,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Massaferro","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Institute, Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica, Montevideo, Uruguay"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Massaferro","id":"37086554965"},{"name":"J.

Most solutions focus on detecting suspicious behavior, aiming at identifying fraudulent activities in a data-driven and automated fashion. The direct economic impact associated with these solutions is commonly overlooked. In this work, we focus on the economic impact related to an NTL solution, where the list of customers to be inspected and the inspection routes are optimized. The clients to be examined are selected considering estimates of the fraud probability, the estimated magnitude of the fraud, and the costs associated with a particular inspection route. The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem leverages existing techniques developed in the context of a problem known as \u201cthe salesman problem.\u201d We validate our approach in real-world data obtained after inspecting over 168k (fraudulent and typical) customers in Uruguay, South America.

This is on account of tools suchlike Finite Element Method (FEM) that can perform several unwieldy and iterative computations in a judicious and stepwise approach yielding transformer designs that meet the stringent technical specification of REs. In the present work, the key objective is to carry out the computation of the winding Eddy loss which fosters in mapping the hotspot temperature in the transformer windings. To enable the computation of dispersed winding Eddy loss, FEM based Ansys Maxwell is employed to treat the magnetic flux density calculations at the hub of individual winding conductors. The vector decomposition of the flux density gives winding Eddy loss as a result of axial and radial magnetic flux leakage components.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Stray Losses in Transformers using Finite Element Method Modelling","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica","doi":"10.1109/PowerAfrica52236.2021.9543100","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica","pdfPath":"/iel7/9542849/9543093/09543100.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PowerAfrica52236.2021.9543100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9543093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Stray Losses in Transformers using Finite Element Method Modelling","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9543100/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Stray Losses in Transformers using Finite Element Method Modelling","confLoc":"Nairobi, Kenya","sourcePdf":"paper_013_r2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07425S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9542849","isNumber":"9543093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9542849","xplore-issue":"9543093","articleId":"9543100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9543128,"authors":[{"name":"Jitong Xin","affiliation":["School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University","Institute of Microelectronics, School of Physics Science and Technology, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jitong","lastName":"Xin","id":"37088984568"},{"name":"Meiyi Cha","affiliation":["School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University","Institute of Microelectronics, School of Physics Science and Technology, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Meiyi","lastName":"Cha","id":"37088984992"},{"name":"Luojia Shi","affiliation":["School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University","Institute of Microelectronics, School of Physics Science and Technology, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Luojia","lastName":"Shi","id":"37088984816"},{"name":"Chunyu Long","affiliation":["School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University","Institute of Microelectronics, School of Physics Science and Technology, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chunyu","lastName":"Long","id":"37088985217"},{"name":"Hairong Li","affiliation":["School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University","Institute of Microelectronics, School of Physics Science and Technology, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hairong","lastName":"Li","id":"37088986481"},{"name":"Fangcong Wang","affiliation":["School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University","Institute of Microelectronics, School of Physics Science and Technology, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fangcong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088983090"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University","Key Laboratory for Magnetism and Magnetic Materials of the Ministry of Education, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088698219"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2204-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2203-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2205-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9543128","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Image recognition","Neural networks","Transportation","Object detection","Hardware","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","target detection","YOLOv3-Tiny","verilog"]}],"abstract":"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the convolution of the neural network has been deploying across a range of industries, and has certain applications in national defense security, transportation monitoring and medical research.

Power outages due to climatic factors are inevitable since a major part of a distribution network is made up of overhead lines and exposed to different unfavorable weather conditions. Climatic factors need to be fully considered when designing a power system model in order to achieve a meaningful system reliability improvement. The projection of power system outage requires a model with high accuracy, taking climatic conditions into consideration. Conventional models rely only on fault data and do not consider climatic factors, and so they have very low accuracy. This research proposes a computational intelligence model using historical fault and climatic data sets of Newcastle, South Africa. Three models are developed in this paper: the trend projection (TP) model, and two artificial neural network (ANN) models (Models 1 and 2). The performance of the models are examined using statistical parameters. The results of the ANN models were satisfactory unlike the trend projection model; thereby illustrating the efficacy of the computational methods.","doi":"10.1109/PowerAfrica52236.2021.9543182","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica","pdfPath":"/iel7/9542849/9543093/09543182.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PowerAfrica52236.2021.9543182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9543093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting Electricity Outage in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa using Trend Projection and Artificial Neural Networks Techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Artificial neural networks","Distribution networks","Predictive models","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","power distribution reliability","power engineering computing","power overhead lines","power transmission faults","power transmission reliability","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electricity outage","KwaZulu-natal","South Africa","artificial neural networks techniques","electric power systems","distribution network","climatic conditions","power system model","system reliability improvement","power system outage","fault data","computational intelligence model","ANN models","statistical parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power outage modeling","power outage prediction","trend projection","artificial neural networks","reliability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting Electricity Outage in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa using Trend Projection and Artificial Neural Networks Techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9543182/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21142522","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001332","fundingName":"CSIR","grantNumber":"K9DSEIF.11214.05400.054RC.UNI"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting Electricity Outage in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa using Trend Projection and Artificial Neural Networks Techniques","confLoc":"Nairobi, Kenya","sourcePdf":"paper_026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065731S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9542849","isNumber":"9543093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9542849","xplore-issue":"9543093","articleId":"9543182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9543209,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Guo","affiliation":["Chengdu Sino Microelectronics Tech.

Most of the articles about the immunity of SRAM circuits focus on changing the circuit structure, such as using 7T, 8T, or 10T memory cells, or adding read and write assist circuits. However, such structural changes can significantly increase the area and the chip leakage current.

Smart Plugs, Smart Appliances and other appliance-level monitoring devices allow to continuously monitor the power consumption of individual appliances present in the house. This work is aimed at detecting electrical anomalies in household appliances by analyzing the disaggregated load consumption derived from appliance-level monitoring devices. For this purpose, we implemented an anomaly detection framework which monitors the hourly energy consumption of three common sources of power absorption: the baseline, the fridge and the electrical devices. Here, we focused our analysis on two kinds of anomalies: single-point deviations and anomalous trends. The analysis of single-point deviations allowed us to identify short-term power peaks due either to unexpected electrical faults or sudden variations in end-users routines. The analysis of anomalous trends revealed several cases in which the end-users gradually increased their ordinary power consumption profile towards more energy-intensive practices. In summary, the results of our work showed that the power consumption derived from appliance-level load monitoring can be used to detect several anomalous power consumption in household appliances.","doi":"10.1109/SEST50973.2021.9543232","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Energy Systems and Technologies (SEST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Energy Systems and Technologies (SEST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9542850/9543091/09543232.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEST50973.2021.9543232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9543091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Anomalies in Household Appliances from Disaggregated Load Consumption","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543232/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Anomalies in Household Appliances from Disaggregated Load Consumption","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"6 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9543232/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Anomalies in Household Appliances from Disaggregated Load Consumption","confLoc":"Vaasa, Finland","sourcePdf":"133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049688S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9542850","isNumber":"9543091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9542850","xplore-issue":"9543091","articleId":"9543232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9543237,"authors":[{"name":"Falak Naaz","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Falak","lastName":"Naaz","id":"37088975353"},{"name":"Janamejaya Channegowda","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Janamejaya","lastName":"Channegowda","id":"37085709562"},{"name":"Meenakshi Lakshminarayanan","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Meenakshi","lastName":"Lakshminarayanan","id":"37088976937"},{"name":"Neha Sara John","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Neha Sara","lastName":"John","id":"37088975891"},{"name":"Aniruddh Herle","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Aniruddh","lastName":"Herle","id":"37088506487"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0311-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0310-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3142-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9543237","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature distribution","Pollution","Open Access","NASA","Transportation","Training data","Voltage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generative Adversarial Network","Battery","Energy Storage","Synthetic Data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543237","abstract":"There has been an increased demand for Energy Storage Systems (ESS) as they power most of today's remote devices and are needed to sustain the ongoing transportation electrification revolution to curb pollution levels.

The system we are going to present is based on a combination of CNN and RNN, as research shows that using CNN and RNN combined achieve better results. We are going to use a pre-trained CNN model called Resnext50. Using this, we save the time of training the model from scratch. The proposed system uses Resnext pretrained model for Feature Extraction and these extracted features are used to train the Long short-term memory (LSTM). Using CNN and RNN combined, we capture the inter frames as well as intra frames features which will be used to detect if the video is real or fake.

As such, prior forecasting techniques that use classical modelling and single deep learning models that undertake feature extraction procedures manually were unable to meet the output demands in specific situations with dynamic variability. Therefore, in this study, we propose an efficient novel hybrid solar irradiance forecasting based on three steps. In step I, we employ a powerful variable input selection strategy named as partial mutual information (PMI) to calculate the linear and non-linear correlations of the original solar irradiance data. In step II, unlike the traditional deep learning models designing their architectures manually, we utilize several deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models optimized by a novel modified whale optimization algorithm in order to compute the forecasting results of the solar irradiance datasets. Finally in step III, we deploy a deep Q-learning reinforcement learning strategy for selecting the best subsets of the combined deep optimized CNN models. Through analysing the forecasting results over two USA solar irradiance stations, it can be inferred that the proposed optimized deep RL-ensemble framework (ODERLEN) outperforms other powerful benchmarked algorithms in different time-step horizons.","doi":"10.1109/SEST50973.2021.9543462","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Energy Systems and Technologies (SEST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEST50973.2021.9543462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9543091","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Smart Energy Systems and Technologies (SEST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9542850/9543091/09543462.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Ensemble Reinforcement Learning Strategy for Solar Irradiance Forecasting using Deep Optimized Convolutional Neural Network Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543462/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Ensemble Reinforcement Learning Strategy for Solar Irradiance Forecasting using Deep Optimized Convolutional Neural Network Models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9543462/","accessionNumber":"21142333","publicationDate":"6 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Ensemble Reinforcement Learning Strategy for Solar Irradiance Forecasting using Deep Optimized Convolutional Neural Network Models","confLoc":"Vaasa, Finland","sourcePdf":"148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088502S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9542850","isNumber":"9543091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9542850","xplore-issue":"9543091","articleId":"9543462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9543500,"authors":[{"name":"Yukai Chen","affiliation":["Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control, Minjiang University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yukai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088995843"},{"name":"Linxin Zheng","affiliation":["Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control, Minjiang University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Linxin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37088995200"},{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control, Minjiang University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088995844"},{"name":"Guobao Xiao","affiliation":["Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control, Minjiang University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guobao","lastName":"Xiao","orcid":"0000-0003-2928-8100","id":"37085492113"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9543500","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Data mining","Task analysis","Clustering algorithms","Geometry","Fuses","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature matching","outlier rejection","attention mechanism"]}],"abstract":"Establishing reliable correspondences from a putative correspondence set is a challenging task. Most of state-of-the-art methods utilize the local context and global context to address the task. However, the local and global context often contains large number of outliers, which have a negative impact on capturing scene geometry. In this paper, we propose a Multi-scale Attention Network (called MANet), which introduces the attention mechanism for feature matching, to improve the ability of capturing scene geometry. Specifically, we first fuse the features of low and high levels by an multi-scale strategy network to enhance the representative ability of features. Then, we propose an attentive PointCN block and an attentive pooling layer, to discriminatively capture global context and local context information, respectively. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets that MANet provides a significant improvement in the performance of the two-view geometry and correspondences accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3114120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09543500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3114120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","startPage":"1978","endPage":"1982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MANet: Multi-Scale Attention Network for Correspondence Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MANet: Multi-Scale Attention Network for Correspondence Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9543500/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62072223"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003392","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province","grantNumber":"2020J01131199"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MANet: Multi-Scale Attention Network for Correspondence Learning","sourcePdf":"lsp-xiao-3114120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070258S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9543500","onlineDate":"21 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":9543509,"authors":[{"name":"Wenxin Tai","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wenxin","lastName":"Tai","orcid":"0000-0001-7364-8324","id":"37088595173"},{"name":"Tian Lan","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Lan","orcid":"0000-0001-6381-7657","id":"38242520400"},{"name":"Qianhui Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qianhui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088998337"},{"name":"Qiao Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qiao","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-2573-9544","id":"37087226395"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9543509","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Feature extraction","Speech enhancement","Noise measurement","Decoding","Encoding","Training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech enhancement","information distillation","dynamic aggregation","deformable convolution"]}],"abstract":"Speech enhancement aims to restore clean speech from noisy environments.

However, the design of handcrafted features for complex SER tasks requires significant manual eort, which impedes generalisability and slows the pace of innovation. This has motivated the adoption of representation learning techniques that can automatically learn an intermediate representation of the input signal without any manual feature engineering. Representation learning has led to improved SER performance and enabled rapid innovation. Its effectiveness has further increased with advances in deep learning (DL), which has facilitated \\textit{deep representation learning} where hierarchical representations are automatically learned in a data-driven manner. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on the important topic of deep representation learning for SER. We highlight various techniques, related challenges and identify important future areas of research. Our survey bridges the gap in the literature since existing surveys either focus on SER with hand-engineered features or representation learning in the general setting without focusing on SER.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543566/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isEarlyAccess":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Survey of Deep Representation Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey of Deep Representation Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition","sourcePdf":"taffc-3114365-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04319S","isNumber":"5520654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","articleId":"9543566","onlineDate":"21 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":9543572,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Gramuglia","affiliation":["EDMI, EPFL STI, 111838 Neuchatel, Neuchatel, Switzerland, 2000 (e-mail: francesco.gramuglia@epfl.ch)"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Gramuglia"},{"name":"Pouyan Keshavarzian","affiliation":["STI IMT, EPFL, 27218 Neuchtel, Switzerland, 2002 (e-mail: pouyan.keshavarzian@epfl.ch)"],"firstName":"Pouyan","lastName":"Keshavarzian"},{"name":"Ekin Kizilkan","affiliation":["EPFL STI IMT NE, 69499 Neuchatel, Switzerland, (e-mail: ekin.kizilkan@epfl.ch)"],"firstName":"Ekin","lastName":"Kizilkan"},{"name":"Claudio Bruschini","affiliation":["SCI-STI-EC, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, (e-mail: claudio.bruschini@epfl.ch)"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Bruschini"},{"name":"Shyue Seng Tan","affiliation":["Globalfoundries Inc Singapore, 497151 Singapore, Singapore, (e-mail: jason.tan@globalfoundries.com)"],"firstName":"Shyue Seng","lastName":"Tan"},{"name":"Michelle Tng","affiliation":["Globalfoundries Inc Singapore, 497151 Singapore, Singapore, (e-mail: JINGHUAMICHELLE.TNG@globalfoundries.com)"],"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Tng"},{"name":"Elgin Quek","affiliation":["Globalfoundries Inc Singapore, 497151 Singapore, Singapore, (e-mail: elgin.quek@globalfoundries.com)"],"firstName":"Elgin","lastName":"Quek"},{"name":"Myung-Jae Lee","affiliation":["KIST, 58975 Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, Korea (the Republic of), (e-mail: mj.lee@kist.re.kr)"],"firstName":"Myung-Jae","lastName":"Lee"},{"name":"Edoardo Charbon","affiliation":["IMT, EPFL, Neuchatel, Switzerland, 2000 (e-mail: edoardo.charbon@epfl.ch)"],"firstName":"Edoardo","lastName":"Charbon"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-260X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4542"}],"articleNumber":"9543572","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543572","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Single-photon avalanche diodes","Junctions","Electric breakdown","Implants","Doping","Photonics","Timing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs)","Photon counting","depth-sensing","BCD","time-correlated single-photon counting(TCSPC)","LIDAR","three-dimensional (3-D) ranging","FLIM","QRNG"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2021.3114346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2944/4481213/09543572.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2021.3114346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Engineering Breakdown Probability Profile for PDP and DCR Optimization in a SPAD Fabricated in a Standard 55nm BCD Process","abstract":"CMOS single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) have broken into the mainstream by enabling the adoption of imaging, timing, and security technologies in a variety of applications within the consumer, medical and industrial domains. The continued scaling of technology nodes creates many benefits but also obstacles for SPAD-based systems. Maintaining and/or improving upon the high-sensitivity, low-noise, and timing performance of demonstrated SPADs in custom technologies or well-established CMOS image sensor processes remains a challenge. In this paper, we present SPADs based on DPW/BNW junctions in a standard Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) technology with results comparable to the state-of-the-art in terms of sensitivity and noise in a deep sub-micron process. Technology CAD (TCAD) simulations demonstrate the improved PDP with the simple addition of a single existing implant, which allows for an engineered performance without modifications to the process.

The orientation of the acoustic vector sensor must be measured, e.g., by an attitude sensor, before its application to DOA estimation. However, the measured orientation generally deviates slightly from its actual orientation because of imperfect attitude measurements. This letter investigates how random deviations in the orientation degrade the performance of DOA estimation. We derive a closed-form approximation of the hybrid Cramer-Rao bound for DOA estimation by modeling the deviations as zero-mean Gaussian variables with small variances. A relationship based on a determinant-differential formula is introduced to avoid a complicated brute-force solution, yielding a sufficiently simple expression with quantitative observations. Numerical results illustrate the high accuracy and effectiveness of the closed-form approximation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-Form Hybrid Cramer-Rao Bound for DOA Estimation by an Acoustic Vector Sensor Under Orientation Deviation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3114125","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09543579.pdf","startPage":"2033","endPage":"2037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3114125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543579/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Form Hybrid Cramer-Rao Bound for DOA Estimation by an Acoustic Vector Sensor Under Orientation Deviation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9543579/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"12074315 and 61901383"},{"fundingName":"Young Talent fund of University Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi","grantNumber":"20190405"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3102019HHZY03007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011368","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Acoustics"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"SKLA202005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2020M670246"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Form Hybrid Cramer-Rao Bound for DOA Estimation by an Acoustic Vector Sensor Under Orientation Deviation","sourcePdf":"lsp-duan-3114125-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112063S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9543579","onlineDate":"21 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9543620,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-1616-2197","id":"37088484738"},{"name":"Guijin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guijin","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-2131-3044","id":"37278825900"},{"name":"Guodong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-3057-5465","id":"37088844444"},{"name":"Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089001922"},{"name":"Huazhong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huazhong","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0003-2421-353X","id":"37085412526"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9543620","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Deep learning-based intelligent electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis algorithms heavily rely on large annotated datasets. Unfortunately, in the context of ECG diagnosis, privacy issues and the high cost of data annotations lead to a shortage of ECG datasets which severely limits the performance of the state-of-the-art ECG diagnosis algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-level contrastive learning scheme for ECG signals, namely CLECG, to mine effective information from unlabeled data. During the pre-training, CLECG encourages the representations of different augmented views of the same signal (positive samples) to be similar and increases the distance between representations of augmented views from the different signals (negative samples). The whole pre-training process does not require any form of labeling. Experimental results show that the proposed CLECG strategy outperforms other self-supervised methods and supervised transfer learning strategies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09543620.pdf","startPage":"1993","endPage":"1997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3114119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3114119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CLECG: A Novel Contrastive Learning Framework for Electrocardiogram Arrhythmia Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Training","Crops","Wavelet transforms","Task analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Rhythm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contrastive learning","electrocardiogram","arrhy-thmia classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"CLECG: A Novel Contrastive Learning Framework for Electrocardiogram Arrhythmia Classification","volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9543620/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB1401804"},{"fundingName":"Beijing National Research Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CLECG: A Novel Contrastive Learning Framework for Electrocardiogram Arrhythmia Classification","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-3114119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063923S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9543620","onlineDate":"21 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9543652,"authors":[{"name":"Sabera Hoque","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, University of Tasmania, Newnham, TAS, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9543652/hoque-3114399-small.gif","p":["Sabera Hoque received the bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and engineering from Northern University Bangladesh, in 2007, and the master\u2019s degree in computer science and engineering from United International University, in 2017.

In the 3D object detection process, classifications are centered on the object\u2019s size, position, and direction. And in 6D pose assumptions, networks emphasize 3D translation and rotation vectors. Successful application of these strategies can have a huge impact on various machine learning-based applications, including the autonomous vehicles, the robotics industry, and the augmented reality sector. Although extensive work has been done on 3D object detection with a pose assumption from RGB images, the challenges have not been fully resolved. Our analysis provides a comprehensive review of the proposed contemporary techniques for complete 3D object detection and the recovery of 6D pose assumptions of an object. In this review research paper, we have discussed several proposed sophisticated methods in 3D object detection and 6D pose estimation, including some popular data sets, evaluation matrix, and proposed method challenges. Most importantly, this study makes an effort to offer some possible future directions in 3D object detection and 6D pose estimation. We accept the autonomous vehicle as the sample case for this detailed review. Finally, this review provides a complete overview of the latest in-depth learning-based research studies related to 3D object detection and 6D pose estimation systems and points out a comparison between some popular frameworks. To be more concise, we propose a detailed summary of the state-of-the-art techniques of modern deep learning-based object detection and pose estimation models.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Object detection","Pose estimation","Laser radar","Cameras","Visualization","Automobiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality","computer vision","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","pose estimation","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["6D pose estimation","3D object detection","6D pose assumptions","rotation vectors","machine learning-based applications","autonomous vehicle","pose assumption","review research paper","in-depth learning-based research studies","modern deep learning-based object detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","deep neural network","computer vision","image processing","convolutional neural network","3D object detection","6D pose estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543652.pdf","startPage":"143746","endPage":"143770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comprehensive Review on 3D Object Detection and 6D Pose Estimation With Deep Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Comprehensive Review on 3D Object Detection and 6D Pose Estimation With Deep Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543652/","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9543652/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"21255804","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Comprehensive Review on 3D Object Detection and 6D Pose Estimation With Deep Learning","sourcePdf":"access-hoque-3114399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.385128S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543652","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9543656,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Fang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9543656/fang-3114331-small.gif","p":["Jie Fang received the master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2019.

To date, packing problems have generally been solved by artificial experience and heuristic algorithms. However, these algorithms are not highly efficient and the excellent cases cannot be preserved, which both time and economic costs are high. Inspire by transfer learning and considering the characteristics of 2D irregular packing problems, we propose a sequence transfer-based particle swarm optimization algorithm (ST-PSO) to solve the multi-constraint packing problem. A piece-matching strategy based on an improved shape context algorithm, and a piece-sequencing generation strategy for transferring the packing sequence are developed for particle swarm optimization(PSO) initialization. In the process of PSO, an adaptive adjustment strategy is used with an improved positioning strategy to adjust the packing position of the pieces. The results indicate that this method can robustly, quickly, and efficiently achieve the packing of 2D irregular pieces. Compared with the data prior to transfer, the ST-PSO can inherit and transfer the historical packing sequence in less time and retain or exceed the actual packing data onto the samples. This algorithm could be applied to industrial applications to reduce waste, packing time, and production costs.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114331","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543656.pdf","startPage":"131223","endPage":"131235","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequence Transfer-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Irregular Packing Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Sequence Transfer-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Irregular Packing Problems","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9543656/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51975231"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Foundational Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2019kfyXKJC043"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sequence Transfer-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Irregular Packing Problems","sourcePdf":"access-fang-3114331-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101941S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543656","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9543657,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Unlike conventional microwave resonant sensors which have a resonant amplitude, the Lorentz sensors also have unique signature in its phase spectra which adds a second degrees of freedom in detection and removes ambiguity in the identification of the resonant frequency. We demonstrate two sensing applications in which ultra-high sensitivity is required. In particular, we show that by exploiting the high electric field regions in Lorentz resonators detection of low density gaseous water states (steam) and sub-wavelength sized biomaterials is possible. The material sensing is performed by characterizing the resonant shifts in the frequency range of 1 to 2 GHz. Depending on the gaseous state concentrations, the dielectric constant of the detected steam lies between 1.04 and 1.6 GHz. The Lorentz resonator is shown to distinguish accurately between different sub-wavelength samples derived from different parts of chicken. We anticipate that the proposed sensor can be used in biosensing of cancerous cells and in detecting low-permittivity poisonous gaseous matter such as clear smoke, carbon mono oxide, methane and nitrogen.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Sensitivity","Substrates","Resonators","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Biosensors","Gas detectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lorentz sensors","anomalous dispersion","resonant sensors","steam sensor","water sensor","gas sensor","biosensor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2021.3114625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/9612611/09543657.pdf","startPage":"26014","endPage":"26022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9612611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3114625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ultra-Sensitive Lorentz Microwave Sensor for Detection of Low-Permittivity Gaseous Water States and Sub-Wavelength Biosamples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Ultra-Sensitive Lorentz Microwave Sensor for Detection of Low-Permittivity Gaseous Water States and Sub-Wavelength Biosamples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543657/","volume":"21","issue":"22","publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9543657/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Deputyship for Research and Innovation, Ministry of Education, Saudi Arabia","grantNumber":"107/442"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002403","fundingName":"Taibah University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ultra-Sensitive Lorentz Microwave Sensor for Detection of Low-Permittivity Gaseous Water States and Sub-Wavelength Biosamples","sourcePdf":"jsen-abutarboush-3114625-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086341S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"9612611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","xplore-issue":"9612611","articleId":"9543657","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9543660,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvester Aboagye","affiliation":["Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John\u2019s, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Sylvester","lastName":"Aboagye","orcid":"0000-0001-6849-923X"},{"name":"Telex M.

This is done while considering practical user behaviors such as random receiver orientation and the presence of obstructions in the direct link between the transmitter and the receiver. Specifically, a system model for an IRS-aided VLC system is proposed and a rate maximization problem is considered to determine the optimal orientation of the IRS mirror array to establish robust non-LoS links. A low-complexity iterative solution based on the sine-cosine algorithm is proposed for this non-convex optimization problem.

The various components that compose such an environment, buildings, labs, public spaces, smart lighting, smart parking, or even smart traffic lights, require us to focus on surveillance systems, and recognize which detection activities to establish. In this paper, we perform a comparative assessment in the area of surveillance systems for Smart Campuses. A proposed taxonomy for IoT-enabled Smart Campus unfold five research dimensions: (1) physical infrastructure; (2) enabling technologies; (3) software analytics; (4) system security; and (5) research methodology. By applying this taxonomy and by adopting a weighted scoring model on the surveyed systems, we first present the state-of-the-art, and then we make a comparative assessment and classify the systems. We extract valuable conclusions and inferences from this classification, providing insights and directions towards required services offered by surveillance systems for Smart Campus.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114447","startPage":"131926","endPage":"131954","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543662.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges and Solutions of Surveillance Systems in IoT-Enabled Smart Campus: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Challenges and Solutions of Surveillance Systems in IoT-Enabled Smart Campus: A Survey","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9543662/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21101894","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543662/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Course of Advanced Quantitative Statistical Analyses, Master of Business Administration (MBA), Department of Business Administration, University of West Attica, Athens, Greece"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland 6 Genesis Flagship","grantNumber":"318927"},{"fundingName":"EU Horizon 2020 Projects CUTLER: Coastal Urban developmenT through the LEnses of Resiliency","grantNumber":"770469"},{"fundingName":"IDUNN Cognitive Detection System for Cybersecure Operational Technologies","grantNumber":"101021911"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Challenges and Solutions of Surveillance Systems in IoT-Enabled Smart Campus: A Survey","sourcePdf":"access-anagnostopoulos-3114447-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160821S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543662","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9543663,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Kurowski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gda\u0144sk University of Technology, Gda\u0144sk, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9543663/kurow-3114628-small.gif","p":["Adam Kurowski was born in Gdansk, in 1991.

The deep learning method employed for the research consists of a deep policy gradient algorithm. It is used as a tool for carrying out a sequential optimization process, which seeks to maximize the fitness function based on parameters characterizing the autocorrelation diffusion coefficient of the designed acoustic diffuser. As the autocorrelation acoustic diffusion coefficients are calculated based on the polar response of a diffuser, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation method is used to obtain a set of impulse responses, which are necessary to calculate the polar responses of the optimized Schroeder diffusers. The results obtained from the optimization derived from the deep learning algorithm were compared with the outcomes of a similar algorithm by employing a genetic algorithm and based on random selection of the Schroeder diffuser well-depth pattern. We found that the best result was achieved by the deep policy gradient, as it produced outcomes that, in terms of the provided autocorrelation diffusion coefficient, were statistically better than the properties of the designs supplied by two other baseline approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543663.pdf","startPage":"136004","endPage":"136017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning Algorithm and FDTD-Based Simulation Applied to Schroeder Diffuser Design Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Mathematical models","Optimization","Finite difference methods","Acoustic waves","Time-domain analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Schroeder diffuser optimization","acoustic simulation","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)","reinforcement learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning Algorithm and FDTD-Based Simulation Applied to Schroeder Diffuser Design Optimization","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9543663/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reinforcement Learning Algorithm and FDTD-Based Simulation Applied to Schroeder Diffuser Design Optimization","sourcePdf":"access-kostek-3114628-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108101S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543663","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9543664,"authors":[{"name":"Bowen Fu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9543664/fu-3114496-small.gif","p":["Bowen Fu is currently pursuing the bachelor\u2019s degree with the School of Electronic Information, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China.

Recycling reduces waste but manual pipeline waste sorting involves a harsh working environment at high labor intensity with low sorting efficiency. In our paper, a novel intelligent garbage classification system based on deep learning and an embedded Linux system is proposed. The system is divided into three parts. First, a Raspberry Pi 4B is utilized as the master board for the hardware system. The peripherals of the system consist of a touch panel, sensors, a 2-DOF (degree of freedom) servo, and a camera. Second, a new GNet model for garbage classification based on transfer learning and the improved MobileNetV3 model is proposed. Third, a GUI based on Python and QT is employed to build a human-computer interaction system to facilitate system manipulation and observation. A series of garbage classification experiments on the Huawei Garbage Classification Challenge Cup dataset were conducted. The proposed classification system\u2019s prediction accuracy was 92.62% at 0.63 s efficiency. The experimental results in this paper demonstrate that the proposed intelligent garbage classification system delivers high performance both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9543664/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Intelligent Garbage Classification System Based on Deep Learning and an Embedded Linux System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Opening Research Fund of the National Engineering Laboratory for Surface Transportation Weather Impacts Prevention","grantNumber":"201801"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"61901059"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Novel Intelligent Garbage Classification System Based on Deep Learning and an Embedded Linux System","sourcePdf":"access-fu-3114496-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079206S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543664","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9543666,"authors":[{"name":"Lubna Nadeem","affiliation":["University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9543666/nadee-3114629-small.gif","p":["Lubna Nadeem received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in telecommunication engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Taxila, Pakistan, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Cellular networks of the future necessitate the formulation of efficient resource allocation schemes that readily meet throughput requirements. The idea of combining Device-to-Device (D2D), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), and Network slicing (NS) can improve spectrum utilization with better performance and scalability. This work presents a spectrum efficiency optimization problem in D2D based 5G-Heterogeneous Cellular Network (5G-HCN) with NS. Owing to the shortage of resources, we propose an underlay model where macro-cell users (MUs), small-cell users (SUs), and D2D users (DUs) reuse the resources while considering the effects of interference. The goal is to maximize the average network spectrum efficiency (SE) and throughput without degrading the system performance. The problem at hand is naturally a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem that is intractable. Therefore, we have suggested a distributed resource allocation strategy with an edge computing (DRA-EC) approach to find the sub-optimal solution. In distributed augmented Lagrange method, each edge router located at BS will solve its problem locally, and the consensus algorithm will find the global solution using these local estimates. The central slice controller will cut the customized network slices according to the bandwidth requirements of each user type with optimized spectrum information. The simulation outcomes prove that our proposed method is near the central optimization scheme with low computational complexity. It is much better because it reduces the computational time and system overhead.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","Resource management","5G mobile communication","Interference","Quality of service","Optimization","Edge computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network slicing","5G cellular networks","mobile edge computing","device-to-device","distributed optimization","consensus algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543666","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114629","startPage":"134148","endPage":"134162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543666.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543666/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Resource Allocation Using Distributed Edge Computing in D2D Based 5G-HCN With Network Slicing","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9543666/","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Efficient Resource Allocation Using Distributed Edge Computing in D2D Based 5G-HCN With Network Slicing","sourcePdf":"access-lubna-3114629-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.222468S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543666","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9543667,"authors":[{"name":"Kiril Antevski","affiliation":["University Carlos III of Madrid, Legan\u00e9s, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9543667/antev-3114593-small.gif","p":["Kiril Antevski received the B.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from Saints Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Macedonia, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2016.

Although the benefits brought by the new 5G air interface will be numerous, 5G is more than just an evolution of radio technology. New concepts, such as the application of network softwarization and programmability paradigms to the overall network design, the reduced latency promised by edge computing, or the concept of network slicing \u2013 just to cite some of them \u2013 will open the door to new vertical-specific services, even capable of saving more lives. This article discusses the implementation and validation of an eHealth service specially tailored for the Emergency Services of the Madrid Municipality. This new vertical application makes use of the novel characteristics of 5G, enabling dynamic instantiation of services at the edge, a federation of domains and execution of real on-the-field augmented reality. The article provides an explanation of the design of the use case and its real-life implementation and demonstration in collaboration with the Madrid emergency response team. The major outcome of this work is a real-life proof-of-concept of this system, which can reduce the time required to respond to an emergency in minutes and perform more efficient triage, increasing the chances of saving lives.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543667.pdf","startPage":"131420","endPage":"131429","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 5G-Based eHealth Monitoring and Emergency Response System: Experience and Lessons Learned","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A 5G-Based eHealth Monitoring and Emergency Response System: Experience and Lessons Learned","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9543667/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU H2020 5GROWTH Project","grantNumber":"856709"},{"fundingName":"Madrid Government (Comunidad de Madrid-Spain) through the Multiannual Agreement with University Carlos III of Madrid UC3M in the line of Excellence of University Professors","grantNumber":"EPUC3M21"},{"fundingName":"Regional Program of Research and Technological Innovation (V PRICIT)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A 5G-Based eHealth Monitoring and Emergency Response System: Experience and Lessons Learned","sourcePdf":"access-antevski-3114593-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160365S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543667","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9543670,"authors":[{"name":"Shanglin Zhou","affiliation":["University of Connecticut (UCONN), Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9543670/zhou-3114364-small.gif","p":["Shanglin Zhou (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in statistics from Minzu University of China, Beijing, China, in 2015, and the M.Sc. degree in statistics from the University of Connecticut, Storrs, in 2017, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer science.","Since 2019, she has been a Research Assistant with the University of Connecticut.

Its unprecedented speed and pervasiveness have led many governments to implement a series of countermeasures, such as lock-downs, stopping/restricting travels, and mandating social distancing. To control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is essential to understand the latent dynamics of the disease\u2019s evolution and the effectiveness of the intervention policies. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) capture both randomnesses in spatio-temporal dynamics and uncertainty in observations. In this paper, we apply an overall HMM that, based on multiple nations\u2019 COVID-19 data including the USA, several European countries, and countries that have strict control policies, explore different types of observations, and we use it to infer the severity state on small geographical states or regions in the USA and Italy as test cases. Further, we aggregate the severity level of each region over a fixed time period to visualize the time evolution and propagation across regions. Such an analysis and visualization provide suggestions for interventions and responses in a calibrated manner. Results from HMM modeling are consistent with what is observed in Italy and the USA and these models can serve as visualization and proactive decision support tools to policymakers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543670.pdf","startPage":"134384","endPage":"134401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Hidden Markov Models to Analyze, Group and Visualize Spatio-Temporal COVID-19 Data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","COVID-19","Diseases","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Pandemics","Standards"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SARS-CoV-2","hidden Markov model","pandemic tracking","pandemic prediction","Viterbi decoding","aggregation","visualization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Application of Hidden Markov Models to Analyze, Group and Visualize Spatio-Temporal COVID-19 Data","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9543670/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)","grantNumber":"FA9500-18-1-0463"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"U.S. Office of Naval Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009917","fundingName":"U.S. Naval Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"N00014-18-1-1238, N00014-21-1-2187 and N00173-16-1-G905"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Application of Hidden Markov Models to Analyze, Group and Visualize Spatio-Temporal COVID-19 Data","sourcePdf":"access-zhou-3114364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132009S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543670","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9543688,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Wilson","affiliation":["Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research (FICS), University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9543688/wilso-3114360-small.gif","p":["Ronald Wilson received the B.E. degree in aeronautical engineering from Riga Technical University, Riga, Latvia, in 2015, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, under the supervision of Dr. Damon L.

It is a resource intensive process that will benefit greatly from the extensive integration of data-driven paradigms, especially in the imaging and image analysis phase. Although obvious, this uptake of data-driven approaches into RE-assisted hardware assurance is lagging due to the lack of massive amounts of high-quality labelled data. In this paper, a large-scale synthetic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) dataset, REFICS, is introduced to address this issue. The dataset, the first open-source dataset in the RE community, consists of 800,000 SEM images over two node technologies, 32nm and 90nm, and four cardinal layers of the IC, namely, doping, polysilicon, contact and metal layers. Furthermore, a framework, based on uncertainty and risk, is introduced to compare the efficacy and benefits of existing RE workflows utilizing ad-hoc steps in its execution. These developments are critical in developing RE-assisted hardware assurance into a scalable, automated and fault-tolerant approach. Finally, the work is concluded with the performance analysis of existing machine learning and deep learning approaches for image analysis in RE and hardware assurance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"REFICS: Assimilating Data-Driven Paradigms Into Reverse Engineering and Hardware Assurance on Integrated Circuits","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114360","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543688.pdf","startPage":"131955","endPage":"131976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"REFICS: Assimilating Data-Driven Paradigms Into Reverse Engineering and Hardware Assurance on Integrated Circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9543688/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"REFICS: Assimilating Data-Driven Paradigms Into Reverse Engineering and Hardware Assurance on Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"access-wilson-3114360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208786S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543688","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9543690,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Nevertheless, user clustering (UC) in NOMA is another prevalent issue. To maximize the throughput and fulfill the successive interference cancellation (SIC) constraints, the UC has been formulated as a clustering optimization problem which has been extensively researched in literature. Recently, an artificial neural network-based UC (ANN-UC) scheme has emerged as a viable solution that can optimally cluster users after exhaustive training. However, the ANN model has an extremely slow learning speed, due to the gradient-based back-propagation (BP) algorithm used by the ANN. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel fast-learning extreme learning machine-based UC (ELM-UC) scheme. Unlike the ANN-UC technique, the input weights and the bias for the hidden layer nodes of ELM are randomly generated and tuning of parameters is not required, thereby leading to a faster learning rate. In this work, the ELM architecture is adapted to operate in NOMA environments where the optimal cluster formation can be predicted rapidly based on the users\u2019 channel gains and powers. Performance comparisons with the state-of-the-art UC schemes are investigated via extensive simulations. Remarkably, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ELM-UC technique can achieve near-optimal performance compared to the brute-force search (B-FS) method and outperforms the existing clustering techniques including ANN-UC and dynamic user clustering (DUC).","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543690.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"130884","endPage":"130894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for Fast User Clustering in Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) 5G Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9543690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for Fast User Clustering in Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) 5G Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9543690/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012024","fundingName":"Multimedia University","grantNumber":"MMUI/170084"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for Fast User Clustering in Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) 5G Networks","sourcePdf":"access-tan-3114619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068567S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543690","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9543692,"authors":[{"name":"Vasileios Leon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9543692/leon-3114502-small.gif","p":["Vasileios Leon received the Diploma degree in computer engineering from the University of Patras, Greece.

Towards verification, the current work devises and applies a methodology to thoroughly assess the BRAVE FPGAs and their SW tools. The paper focuses on NG-Large, i.e., the largest FPGA of the 65nm Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) technology of NanoXplore to date. The proposed approach comprises a number of customized steps to systematically evaluate the entire FPGA design flow. Initially, we carefully select and tune a set of high-performance Digital Signal Processing (DSP) & Computer Vision (CV) benchmarks, which were originally developed as Hardware Description Language (HDL) IPs in past projects of the European Space Agency (ESA). Subsequently, we perform exhaustive exploration of the Synthesis, Placement, and Routing stages of the SW tools, as well as testing on actual HW boards. At each step, we generate and analyze a variety of results, while we also compare them to 3rd-party solutions. The results show that NG-Large provides sufficient programmability and performance, e.g., classic CV IPs for feature detection on megapixel images can achieve a throughput of 5\u201310 frames per second, while the on-chip memory utilization is up to 56% better than that of 3rd-party FPGAs. As a highlight, at system-level, we successfully implement and execute an entire HW/SW algorithmic pipeline for Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) involving SpaceWire data transfers with LEON CPU & NG-Large co-processing.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543692.pdf","startPage":"131877","endPage":"131892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114502","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and Testing on the European Space-Grade BRAVE FPGAs: Evaluation of NG-Large Using High-Performance DSP Benchmarks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Development and Testing on the European Space-Grade BRAVE FPGAs: Evaluation of NG-Large Using High-Performance DSP Benchmarks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543692/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9543692/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100018960","fundingName":"National Technical University of Athens via the Project i-CoVo: Implementation of Computer Vision Algorithms on Embedded Architectures","grantNumber":"950032"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000844","fundingName":"European Space Agency via the Activity QUEENS2: Quality Assessment of The New European Large BRAVE FPGA Software Tools","grantNumber":"4000128041/19/NL/AR/va"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Development and Testing on the European Space-Grade BRAVE FPGAs: Evaluation of NG-Large Using High-Performance DSP Benchmarks","sourcePdf":"access-leon-3114502-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168218S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543692","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":9543695,"authors":[{"name":"Minjia Shi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing of Ministry of Education, School of Mathematics Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"p":["Minjia Shi received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Computer Network Systems, Hefei University of Technology, China, in 2010.

Existing Quantum Annealing processing units are readily available via cloud platform access for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. In particular, the novel D-Wave Advantage device has been recently released. Its performance is expected to improve upon the previous state-of-the-art D-Wave 2000Q annealer, due to higher number of qubits and the Pegasus topology. Here, we present a comparative study via an ensemble of Maximum Likelihood (ML) Channel Decoder problems for MIMO scenarios in Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures. The main challenge for exact optimization of ML decoders with ever-increasing demand for higher data rates is the exponential increase of the solution space with problem sizes. Since current 5G solutions mainly use approximate methodologies, Kim \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</i>\n leveraged Quantum Annealing for large MIMO problems with Phase Shift Keying and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation scenarios. Here, we extend their work and analyze experiments for more complex modulations and larger MIMO antenna array sizes. By implementing the extended QUBO formulae on the novel annealer architecture, we uncover the limits of state-of-the-art quantum optimization for the massive MIMO ML decoder. We report on the improvements and discuss the uncovered limiting factors learned from the 64-QAM extension. We include the enhanced evaluation of raw annealer sampling via implementation of post-processing methods in the comparative analysis between D-Wave 2000Q and the D-Wave Advantage system.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114543","startPage":"131658","endPage":"131671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09543699.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Quantum Annealer Performance via the Massive MIMO Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9543699/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Quantum Annealer Performance via the Massive MIMO Problem","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9543699/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hungarian Quantum Technology National Excellence Program"},{"fundingName":"Quantum Information National Laboratory of Hungary"},{"fundingName":"Hungarian Quantum Technology National Excellence Program","grantNumber":"2017-1.2.1-NKP-2017-00001"},{"fundingName":"Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) within the Quantum Information National Laboratory of Hungary","grantNumber":"FK 135220, K124176 and KH129601"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Evaluation of Quantum Annealer Performance via the Massive MIMO Problem","sourcePdf":"access-tabi-3114543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091243S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9543699","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9543702,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Kang","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada","University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Justin Kang (Member, IEEE) received the B.A.Sc. degree in engineering physics from The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2019, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2021.

In this paper, a power-domain NOMA scheme based on high-dimensional modulation superposition and non-ideal channel estimation is proposed. The modulation constellations of NOMA are based on high-dimensional spherical and lattice codes, whose detection performances are better than that of traditional two-dimensional modulation. By analyzing the upper bounds of detection errors in a two-user NOMA system with non-ideal channel estimation, we propose the optimal power allocation strategy which can minimize the transmit power with a given word error probability. Simulation results show that our proposed power allocation strategy can work well with different channel estimation errors.","doi":"10.1109/CCET52649.2021.9544158","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering Technology (CCET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering Technology (CCET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544087/9544108/09544158.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCET52649.2021.9544158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544108","startPage":"318","endPage":"322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Dimensional Modulation Superposition NOMA with Non-ideal Channel Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Dimensional Modulation Superposition NOMA with Non-ideal Channel Estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544158/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544158/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701234"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Dimensional Modulation Superposition NOMA with Non-ideal Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"066_IEEE-CCET21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054776S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544087","isNumber":"9544108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544087","xplore-issue":"9544108","articleId":"9544158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9544164,"authors":[{"name":"Pedram Havaei","affiliation":["Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Havaei","id":"37088984653"},{"name":"Elham Mahmoudzadeh","affiliation":["Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Elham","lastName":"Mahmoudzadeh","id":"37088442079"},{"name":"Maryam Zekri","affiliation":["Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Zekri","id":"37397762800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3365-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3366-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-9527"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"9544164","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"P300 Evoked Related Potential Detection Based on Integration of Modified HOG and Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel method based on the combination of modified histogram of oriented gradients (MHOG) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for P300 evoked related potential (ERP) detection. In this method, HOG is modified for 2-D EEG signal and is fed to CNN as input. Due to the inputs as MHOG, the training features are chosen among a variety of gradients, and the best features are selected for training the CNN structure. This approach (MHOG-CNN) ends in a simpler structure and therefore, the whole performance is acceptable with faster rates and high accuracy. The performance of MHOG-CNN is examined by applying BCI Competition III Dataset. This dataset represents a complete record for P300 ERP with BCI2000 using a paradigm, and it has several noises including power and muscle-based noises. The objective is to predict the correct character in each of the provided character selection epochs. In comparison to other methods, simulation results indicate remarkable abilities of MHOG-CNN structure for P300 ERP detection.

Although state-of-art deep learning methods can outperform several research domains, the lack of sufficiently large data for vein-based biometric recognition can suffer from generalization problems and degrades the model accuracy. Our approach trained Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) with triplet loss for classification as an additional task. Lately, triplet networks are widely applied as it learns the latent space representation between neighbors and performs significantly higher accuracy even for insufficient data size. Moreover, in practical application, the quality of acquired vein images is low due to external factors and affects the recognition accuracy. To overcome this problem, we propose a CNN-based Encoder-Decoder network for vein segmentation to utilize the accuracy performance. Jerman enhancement filter is applied to enhance the vein ROI images for labeling the ground truth mask images for training the Encoder-Decoder network.","doi":"10.1109/ICCEAI52939.2021.00088","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (ICCEAI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (ICCEAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544086/9544110/09544167.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEAI52939.2021.00088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TripletGAN VeinNet: Palm Vein Recognition Based on Generative Adversarial Network and Triplet Loss","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544167/","displayDocTitle":"TripletGAN VeinNet: Palm Vein Recognition Based on Generative Adversarial Network and Triplet Loss","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544167/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TripletGAN VeinNet: Palm Vein Recognition Based on Generative Adversarial Network and Triplet Loss","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"396000a454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065305S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544086","isNumber":"9544110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544086","xplore-issue":"9544110","articleId":"9544167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9544224,"authors":[{"name":"Deniz Najafi","affiliation":["Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Deniz","lastName":"Najafi","id":"37088987418"},{"name":"Behzad Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"37540773000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3365-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3366-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-9527"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"9544224","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Leakage 6T SRAM Cell for In-Memory Computing with High Stability","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544084/9543706/09544224.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9543706","doi":"10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544224","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Microprocessors","Merging","Computer architecture","Voltage","Logic gates","SRAM cells"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["In-Memory-computing","IGFinFET","polymorphic","low-leakage","SRAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544224","abstract":"In this paper, a novel low-leakage six transistor static random access memory (SRAM) is proposed in IGFinFET technology.

Both simulation and measurement results show that an optimal Class F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22121</sup>\n PAis realized from 1.7 to 2.3 GHz with a measured efficiency of 66-83.8% and output power of 37\u201340 dBm. Meanwhile, the PA acts as an optimal Class \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$F$</tex>\n amplifier in the frequency range of 3.2-3.4 GHz with a measured efficiency of 62-76% and output power of 38.7-40 dBm. The implemented P A achieves a measured bandwidth from 1.4-3.4 GHz with >36 dBm output power and >58% drain efficiency. The measurement results show that this PAis among the best reported works.","doi":"10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544239","startPage":"117","endPage":"123","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544084/9543706/09544239.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9543706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design of Highly Efficient Harmonic Tuned Wideband Class F-1/F Power Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2021","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Highly Efficient Harmonic Tuned Wideband Class F-1/F Power Amplifier","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2021","publicationDate":"18 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544239/","accessionNumber":"21203042","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544239/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Highly Efficient Harmonic Tuned Wideband Class F-1/F Power Amplifier","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of","sourcePdf":"027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074783S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544084","isNumber":"9543706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544084","xplore-issue":"9543706","articleId":"9544239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9544258,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Vahid Moravvej","affiliation":["Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Vahid","lastName":"Moravvej","id":"37088877458"},{"name":"Mohammad Javad Maleki Kahaki","affiliation":["University of Kashan, Kashan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Javad Maleki","lastName":"Kahaki","id":"37088922061"},{"name":"Moein Salimi Sartakhti","affiliation":["Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Moein Salimi","lastName":"Sartakhti","id":"37088920503"},{"name":"Abdolreza Mirzaei","affiliation":["Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Abdolreza","lastName":"Mirzaei","id":"37424863700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3365-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3366-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-9527"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"9544258","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method Based on Attention Mechanism using Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory(BLSTM) for Question Answering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544258","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrical engineering","COVID-19","Neural networks","Knowledge discovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Question answering","Natural Language Processing","Attention-Based Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory","Covid-19"]}],"abstract":"Question answering (QA) enables the system to answer questions automatically. In recent years, much research has been done in this area. In most methods, question and answer words are given equal importance, which leads to poor model performance. This paper proposed Attention-Based Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory(BLSTM) to select the answer to the question. In our model, first, word embedding is trained in several different ways. Then, we consider two BLSTM networks for question and answer. The outputs of these two networks and the difference between them are connected and entered into a feed-forward neural network. Finally, this network assigns a score to a question-answer pair. We evaluate our proposed model on the English and Persian datasets about Covid-19. The experiments demonstrate that our model achieves better results than other compared methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544258","publicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544084/9543706/09544258.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9543706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Method Based on Attention Mechanism using Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory(BLSTM) for Question Answering","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544258/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"18 May 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method Based on Attention Mechanism using Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory(BLSTM) for Question Answering","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of","sourcePdf":"090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088593S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544084","isNumber":"9543706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544084","xplore-issue":"9543706","articleId":"9544258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9544265,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Qun Zhou","affiliation":["Yanbian University Yanji, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Li-Qun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37088978467"},{"name":"Jin-Chun Piao","affiliation":["Yanbian University Yanji, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Jin-Chun","lastName":"Piao","id":"37088865186"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3890-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3889-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4613-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544265","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Convolution","Computational modeling","Conferences","Object detection","Radar polarimetry","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","radar imaging","ships","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightweight YOLOv4 Based SAR image ship detection","deep learning technology","significant achievements","real-time detection","lightweight YOLOv4 ship detection method","lightweight network MobileNetv2","depth-wise separable convolution","original YOLOv4 experimental results"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ship detection","YOLOv4","MobileNetv2","Attention","SAR"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544265","abstract":"In recent years, deep learning technology has made significant achievements in SAR image ship detection.

Recently, stochastic computation elements (SC) show the great potential to implement MLP with a low hardware complexity. The conversion between binary numbers and stochastic sequences has dramatic effect on accuracy and speed of an MLP implementation. In this paper, two novel architectures for digital to probability converter (DPC) and probability to digital converter (PDC) are proposed to improve the accuracy and the precision of an MLP implantation. The novel DPC performs the conversion by higher precision than the previous ones. The stochastic sequences converts to their corresponding binary numbers by 100% precision using the proposed PDC. Furthermore, the required number of clocks to generate the binary numbers are lower than the best method (~0.1 by average) and are equal for all of the numbers.","doi":"10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544286","startPage":"94","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9543706","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544084/9543706/09544286.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Cost Implementation of Neural Networks Based on Stochastic Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544286/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low Cost Implementation of Neural Networks Based on Stochastic Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544286/","publicationDate":"18 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Cost Implementation of Neural Networks Based on Stochastic Computing","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of","sourcePdf":"022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076473S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544084","isNumber":"9543706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544084","xplore-issue":"9543706","articleId":"9544286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9544293,"authors":[{"name":"Fazel Ziraksaz","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Enh., Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Fazel","lastName":"Ziraksaz","id":"37086931218"},{"name":"Alireza Hassanzadeh","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Eng., Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Hassanzadeh","id":"37842310200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3365-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3366-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-9527"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"9544293","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Impedance matching","Simulation","Power amplifiers","Voltage","Switches","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","impedance matching","microswitches","microwave amplifiers","microwave switches","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G power amplifier","wideband fifth generation Power Amplifiers","tunable RF-MEMS impedance matching network","IMN structure","wideband fifth generation power amplifiers","RF-MEMS switches","Advance Design System","COMSOL simulation software","frequency 23.4 GHz to 31.9 GHz","S"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tunable Impedance Matching Network (IMN)","RF-MEMS switch","5G"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544293","abstract":"This paper presents a new tunable Impedance Matching Network (IMN) structure in frequency range of 23.4-31.9GHz for wideband fifth generation (5G) Power Amplifiers (PAs) by using RF-MEMS switches.

Each user node can send and receive signals, which has the function of automatic routing (forwarding message) in a decentralized network composed of D2D communication users. A framework model of device-to-device (D2D) communication in MIMO system based on random geometry is proposed. D2D communication is introduced to improve the performance of large-scale multi-input and multi-output cellular systems. Assuming that the maximum rate transmission or zero forced precoding scheme is used for cellular downlink transmission, the rate that can be achieved by cellular users is analyzed and deduced. If users are close to each other, they can share the same internal precoder and have the same spatial covariance matrix. In this case, user cooperation among these users can be realized through D2D link sharing receiver information to improve the efficiency of the communication system. The simulation results are consistent with the theoretical results and our model is validated.","doi":"10.1109/CCET52649.2021.9544321","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering Technology (CCET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering Technology (CCET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544087/9544108/09544321.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCET52649.2021.9544321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"D2D is Used to Improve MIMO System Gain in 5G Power Communication Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544321/","displayDocTitle":"D2D is Used to Improve MIMO System Gain in 5G Power Communication Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544321/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"D2D is Used to Improve MIMO System Gain in 5G Power Communication Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"070_IEEE-CCET21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050002S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544087","isNumber":"9544108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544087","xplore-issue":"9544108","articleId":"9544321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9544351,"authors":[{"name":"Homam Ahmed","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Homam","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37088977943"},{"name":"Zhu Jie","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Jie","id":"37088979740"},{"name":"Muhammad Usman","affiliation":["School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Usman","id":"37088977308"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3890-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3889-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4613-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544351","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","5G mobile communication","Image edge detection","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Object detection","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fire detection","edge computing","internet of things","object detection","neural network accelerator","deep learning","cloud computing","5G communication"]}],"abstract":"The emergence of the 5G network has boosted the advancements in the field of the internet of things (IoT) and edge/cloud computing.

Compiling loops with branch is a challenge to static-scheduling CGRA. Conventional mapping algorithms usually only consider coarse-grained operator placement and coarse-grained data routing. How to route fine-grained data in case of dealing with branches and other control flows is not considered. Existing CGRA architectures also have no components dedicated to fine-grained computing, storage, and routing. This paper proposes 1) a novel hybrid compiler framework including performance evaluation, the generation and optimization of data flow graphs (DFG), mapping optimization and configuration generation, which addresses control flow compilation, 2) a lightweight modification to CGRA architecture to support explicit control-flow routing and Boolean operations. Experimental results show that 1) the hybrid compiler framework can effectively extract features of branches and choose appropriate methods, 2) graph optimization and graph balance effectively reduce the size of the DFG, thereby reducing compilation time and power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/CCET52649.2021.9544384","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering Technology (CCET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544087/9544108/09544384.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCET52649.2021.9544384","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering Technology (CCET)","startPage":"290","endPage":"294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compiling Loops with Branches on Static-Scheduling CGRA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Compiling Loops with Branches on Static-Scheduling CGRA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544384/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544384/","publicationDate":"13 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compiling Loops with Branches on Static-Scheduling CGRA","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"061_IEEE-CCET21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088795S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544087","isNumber":"9544108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544087","xplore-issue":"9544108","articleId":"9544384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":9544387,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Sharifian.M.M","affiliation":["University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Sharifian.M.M","id":"37088996167"},{"name":"Vahid Rashtchi","affiliation":["University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Rashtchi","id":"37567784700"},{"name":"Ali Azarpeyvand","affiliation":["University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Azarpeyvand","id":"37400306000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3365-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3366-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-9527"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"9544387","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Electrical engineering","Time-frequency analysis","Frequency synthesizers","Hardware","Encryption","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryptography","Image Encryption","Chaos Theory","FPGA","High-level Synthesis"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, the use of digital images in data transmission networks and digital devices has increased greatly. Therefore, the security of images in transmission or storage has become very important due to security attacks. For this reason, cryptography is used to protect images from unauthorized access and attacks. In this paper, an image encryption algorithm using chaos theory is proposed in which, besides providing the appropriate level of security, the speed of encryption operations is also considered. The 1D tent map is used for the encryption process. Its security analyses have been performed to verify its efficiency in terms of security. The hardware implementation of the algorithm was performed on FPGA with the help of high-level synthesis (HLS), architectural techniques, time and resource optimization. Based on our experimental results, the hardware designed for image encryption is robust in terms of security and it can achieve an encryption and decryption time of 21.14 milliseconds for an image with a size of \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${256\\times 256}$</tex>\n.","doi":"10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544387","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544084/9543706/09544387.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9543706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544387","publicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","startPage":"165","endPage":"169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of a Chaos Based Image Encryption Using High-Level Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of a Chaos Based Image Encryption Using High-Level Synthesis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544387/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544387/","publicationDate":"18 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of a Chaos Based Image Encryption Using High-Level Synthesis","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of","sourcePdf":"036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051564S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544084","isNumber":"9543706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544084","xplore-issue":"9543706","articleId":"9544387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":9544391,"authors":[{"name":"Cuiqian Yang","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Cuiqian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088981836"},{"name":"Yatong Zhou","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yatong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086131772"},{"name":"Hao He","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"He","id":"37088985619"},{"name":"Jingfei He","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jingfei","lastName":"He","id":"37085765346"},{"name":"Yue Chi","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Chi","id":"37088982665"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3960-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3961-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544391","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544391","abstract":"In recent years, seismic data processing based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) has made great progress. However, most of these methods rely on the feature information on the same scale and cannot make full use of the self-similarity of seismic data. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel Pyramid Attention Residual Neural Network (PARNet) for seismic data denoising. Specifically, the main framework of the network includes the residual block (ResBlock), the residual block with multi-core convolutional layer, the parallel space and channel attention (MSCARB) and the pyramid module(Pyramid Module). Among them, MSACRB can not only extract more abundant features, but also focus on the features of channel and spatial dimension, so as to achieve stronger feature representation. The pyramid module captures multi-scale features through dilated convolution with different expansion rates. At the same time, the global context module can capture the global information of the feature map. The combination of the above two modules can achieve the purpose of capturing multi-scale global context features. This method has been verified on synthetic seismic data and field seismic data. The experiments use PSNR and SSIM as evaluation indicators. A large number of experiments have demonstrated that PARNet has efficient denoising ability and a competitive advantage compared with the latest seismic data denoising methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCEAI52939.2021.00077","startPage":"387","endPage":"390","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (ICCEAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544086/9544110/09544391.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (ICCEAI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEAI52939.2021.00077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pyramid Residual Neural Network with Attention for Seismic Data Denoising","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Noise reduction","Feature extraction","Data processing","Convolutional neural networks","Artificial intelligence","Residual neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pyramid","multi-scale","residual network","attention mechanism","seismic data denoising"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Pyramid Residual Neural Network with Attention for Seismic Data Denoising","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544391/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pyramid Residual Neural Network with Attention for Seismic Data Denoising","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"396000a387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042257S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544086","isNumber":"9544110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544086","xplore-issue":"9544110","articleId":"9544391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9544411,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Guo","id":"37088982509"},{"name":"Zhengyou Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University","Hebei Key Laboratory for Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Information Processing, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291901100"},{"name":"Shanna Zhuang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University","Hebei Key Laboratory for Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Information Processing, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Shanna","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"38232158300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3960-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3961-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544411","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544411","abstract":"With the promotion of information technology, network security issues have received more and more attention.

Conventionally, it is assumed that each AP serves all users. In this work, however, to lessen the computational and hardware costs, instead of serving all users, each AP serves limited number of them. We propose an algorithm for assigning users to each AP. Besides, we assume each AP is connected to a central processing unit (CPU) via limited capacity fronthaul link. To efficiently address the fronthaul capacity constraints, three strategies for sending signals from APs to the CPU are employed; namely: compress-forward-estimate (CFE), estimate-compress-forward (ECF), and estimate-multiply compress-forward (EMCF). We drive the capacity of the aforementioned systems with user management constraint. It is shown that the proposed user management improves the performance of the ECF and EMCF from both sum spectral efficiency (SE) and per user SE aspects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Management in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with Limited Fronthaul Capacity","publicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doi":"10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544413","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544084/9543706/09544413.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE52715.2021.9544413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9543706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2021","displayDocTitle":"User Management in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with Limited Fronthaul Capacity","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544413/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"18 May 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Management in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with Limited Fronthaul Capacity","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of","sourcePdf":"163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046417S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544084","isNumber":"9543706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544084","xplore-issue":"9543706","articleId":"9544413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9544414,"authors":[{"name":"Xuecong Chen","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xuecong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088979290"},{"name":"Jinchao Chen","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jinchao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085813814"},{"name":"Chenglie Du","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chenglie","lastName":"Du","id":"37410884500"},{"name":"Yongqiang Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Army Aviation, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088979934"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3890-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3889-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4613-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544414","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544414","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Greedy algorithms","Costs","Conferences","Simulated annealing","Path planning","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","computational geometry","mobile robots","path planning","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved simulated annealing","ISA","convex polygon region","region coverage path planning","unmanned aerial vehicles","UAVs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coverage path planning","UAV","simulation annealing algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCET52649.2021.9544414","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544087/9544108/09544414.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering Technology (CCET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering Technology (CCET)","startPage":"238","endPage":"242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCET52649.2021.9544414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Region Coverage Path Planning of Multiple Disconnected Convex Polygons Based on Simulated Annealing Algorithm","abstract":"Over the past decades, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in both industrial and military operations around the world.

In the present study, the mechanical parameters of different breast tissue lesions were noninvasively estimated with high precision based on the displacement data by using the powerful neural network method in order to detect the type of tumor in the breast tissue. The displacement data of various breast tissues, as well as the corresponding mechanical properties were acquired to develop and train the neural network models. For simulating breast tissue behavior and extracting the relevant displacement data to train the neural networks, the finite element modeling was applied using Abaqus software. Ogden and Yeoh hyperelastic models which are precise for expressing the hyperelastic behavior of soft tissues, specifically the breast, were used to create the finite element model for tumor-containing breast tissue. With the aim of obtaining a robust neural network model, the displacement data extracted from the finite element model and white noise summated to simulate laboratory conditions while deriving tissue data from finite element model. As indicated by the results, the trained neural network models represent high precision and efficiency in appraising the mechanical parameters of various breast tissues according to the displacement data, which promises its use for carefully diagnosing the type of breast lesion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544420/","accessionNumber":"21203071","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544420/","publicationDate":"18 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Noninvasive Diagnosis of the Type of Breast Tumor through Artificial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noninvasive Diagnosis of the Type of Breast Tumor through Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of","sourcePdf":"180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067408S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544084","isNumber":"9543706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544084","xplore-issue":"9543706","articleId":"9544420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9544445,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Fatan Serj","affiliation":["Rovira i Virgili University, Tarragona, Spain"],"firstName":"Mehdi Fatan","lastName":"Serj","id":"37088981505"},{"name":"Mersad Asgari","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, K.N.

An autoencoder based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network is proposed for anomaly detection of bearing condition monitoring system of the hydropower unit. The input sensor signals contain 7 features, and the anomaly is judged by the residual error between the reconstructed data and the original data. The proposed method is compared with one-class support vector machine method and autoencoder method.

One of these technologies is based on visible light communication (VLC), which has become popular due to its benefits. This technique has shown significant advantages, including cost efficiency, long lifetime and good environmental friendliness. In this paper, we use VLC positioning based on the angle difference of arrival (ADOA) to estimate the position of people or devices in a large scale indoor environment using the least square method. Two different placements for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are considered. Assuming practical limited field of view (FOV) for the user's camera, part of LEDs in the image plane can be observed. Thus, we propose a simple method to find the position of users using the cross-correlation between the reference images and the user image. This approach reduces the search region.

This research work is focusing more on the multiple-inputs multiple-outputs(MIMO) system, and by using this system this research study aims to produce a higher data rate, higher data flowing channels by using multiplexing and diversity. Nowadays, wireless technology is on growing so for the future point of view, it is highly required to improve the current data flowing rate properties on the transceiver side. Here, by using both ends of the nodes, a higher data flowing capacity of the wireless system can be achieved with very negligible losses along with consistent quality performance while transporting the data packets from one door to another and getting a quick response through the channel that is modified by using spatial multiplexing and increasing it higher-level up. This spatial multiplexing help undamaged data packets to arrive at the link target as quickly as possible while transmission and due to this the higher data flowing rate can be achieved with a higher data gaining rate by only using the MIMO system. Based on past communication technologies, this study has have determined that Alamouti STBC and ZF equalizer is the best remedy for the analysis of MIMO system to calculate communication diversity including the helping hands of BPSK modulation technique for achieving a better quality result. The Alamouti STBC and ZF equalization technique is used to calculate the BER result and this would be the linear equalization technique that is used to find the receiver nodes on the transceivers. The most important key point is that, all the operations are performing on MATLAB.","doi":"10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544508","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544088/9544092/09544508.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544092","startPage":"422","endPage":"429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study and Analysis in MIMO Wireless Channel for STBC and Equalization Techniques by Using Matlab","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study and Analysis in MIMO Wireless Channel for STBC and Equalization Techniques by Using Matlab","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544508/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544508/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study and Analysis in MIMO Wireless Channel for STBC and Equalization Techniques by Using Matlab","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088662S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544088","isNumber":"9544092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544088","xplore-issue":"9544092","articleId":"9544508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9544513,"authors":[{"name":"Jebaveerasingh Jebadurai","affiliation":["Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Jebaveerasingh","lastName":"Jebadurai","id":"37088977585"},{"name":"Immanuel Johnraja Jebadurai","affiliation":["Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Immanuel Johnraja","lastName":"Jebadurai","id":"37086465571"},{"name":"Getzi Jeba Leelipushpam Paulraj","affiliation":["Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Getzi Jeba Leelipushpam","lastName":"Paulraj","id":"37086466033"},{"name":"Sushen Vallabh Vangeepuram","affiliation":["Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Sushen Vallabh","lastName":"Vangeepuram","id":"37088977707"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3877-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3876-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4604-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544513","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handwritten Text Recognition and Conversion Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Based Deep Learning Model","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544088/9544092/09544513.pdf","startPage":"1037","endPage":"1042","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544092","doi":"10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544513","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Handwriting recognition","Recurrent neural networks","Text recognition","Databases","Training data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Character Recognition","Deep Learning","CTC loss","LSTM","CNN","RNN","Deep Neural Networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544513","abstract":"Recognition of handwritten documents has been an attractive area of research for the past few years.

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to study the features of similar objects from multiple image samples and to classify them. Since the text is sequential data, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), an extension of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with a longer memory is used. To deal with different placements of the text in the image, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss is employed. The IAM Handwriting Database containing handwriting samples from over 600 writers and images of over 100,000 words is used for training.

For bringing in the most productivity, the decision of planting a suitable crop in a particular location is necessary. But, there is a general problem among farmers and other agricultural activists that they don't opt for better scientifically proven methods for crop recommendation. Thus, our proposed work would help farmers in selecting the right crop based on factors like cost of cultivation, cost of production, yield to increase productivity and get more profit out of this proposed technique.

Energy harvesting for IoT, especially ambient backscatter communication, is a likely solution to support the long-term operation of green IoT networks. In this paper, we study a small cell cooperative ambient backscatter network comprised of a primary transmitter (PTx), a primary receiver (PRx), a passive backscatter device (BD) and an IoT receiver. Next, we investigate the outage performance of these devices when full-duplex users are employed in the backscatter system to improve the system transmission rate. Then, we derive exact and asymptotic outage probability (OP) expressions for both PRx, BD, and IoT receiver. Lastly, the obtained expressions are verified using Monte Carlo simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544541/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544541/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis for a Cognitive Radio Based Ambient Backscatter System in Presence of Full-duplex Users","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis for a Cognitive Radio Based Ambient Backscatter System in Presence of Full-duplex Users","confLoc":"PUNE, India","sourcePdf":"ASIANCON2021Paper0690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077301S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544081","isNumber":"9544090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544081","xplore-issue":"9544090","articleId":"9544541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":9544549,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Li","affiliation":["College of Arts and Humanities, Jiangsu Maritime Institute, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Li","id":"37088980665"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3877-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3876-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4604-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544549","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systematics","Sociology","Estimation","Genetics","Data models","Robustness","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finance","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crossover operation","colleges","precision funding","genetic optimization algorithm","path estimation","robust model","data monitoring model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Monitoring","Genetic Optimization","Data Structure","Realization Path","Precision Funding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544549","abstract":"Genetic optimization algorithm for construction and realization path of the precision funding for colleges with data monitoring model is defined in this paper.

These multilingual texts pose a great challenge to conventional Natural Language Processing systems, which currently rely greatly on monolingual resources and cannot handle the combination of multiple languages. The study of people's attitude, opinions, views and to classify them as positive, negative or neutral is called Sentiment Analysis. It is an extremely powerful tool in today's world since it allows businesses, restaurants, internet providers, airlines, etc to quickly detect dissatisfied customers, categorize issues with urgency and prioritize responses. The proposed system focuses on the sentiment analysis of a Hinglish (Hindi-English) text corpus. This paper discusses various approaches such as the Lexicon-Based, Rule-Based and Machine Learning approaches to study the effectiveness of the approach chosen for classifying the text corpus with their appropriate sentiment labels. The proposed Machine Learning techniques are evaluated using parameters Precision, Recall, F1-score and Accuracy and out of all the approaches used, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) approaches have given the best results with both algorithms giving an F1-score of 0.86 and accuracy of 86%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544088/9544092/09544554.pdf","startPage":"651","endPage":"658","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","doi":"10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sentiment Analysis of Mixed-Case Language using Natural Language Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Sentiment analysis","Machine learning algorithms","Social networking (online)","Machine learning","Forestry","Tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sentiment Analysis","Data Preprocessing","Hinglish","Natural Language Processing","Code-Mixed Text","TF-IDF features","Logistic Regression","Random Forest","SVM","KNN","Machine Learning","Lexicon Based Approach","Rule based approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Sentiment Analysis of Mixed-Case Language using Natural Language Processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544554/","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sentiment Analysis of Mixed-Case Language using Natural Language Processing","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124797S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544088","isNumber":"9544092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544088","xplore-issue":"9544092","articleId":"9544554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9544557,"authors":[{"name":"Sanju","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Imaging & Forensics Sharda University, Greater Noida, U.P., India"],"lastName":"Sanju","id":"37088981981"},{"name":"Ashok Kumar","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Imaging & Forensics Sharda University, Greater Noida, U.P., India"],"firstName":"Ashok","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37088981441"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8402-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-7281-8400-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8401-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8403-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544557","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544557","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["White blood cells","Visualization","Technological innovation","Transfer learning","Tools","Bones","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Networks","Computer-Aided Diagnosis","Deep Learning","Feature Extraction","Transfer Learning"]}],"abstract":"An image processing based computer aided diagnostic tool for Multiple Myeloma cancer diagnosis was developed.

For the task of classifying images containing cancerous cells or not, we obtained a good classification accuracy of 93.58%, which was further improved using Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning with different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks models, namely VGG (Visual Geometry Group), VGG-16, VGG-19, MobileNetV1, and MobileNetV2 that gave an accuracy of 94.00%, 95.50%, 99.90%, and 97% respectively.","publicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544081/9544090/09544557.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9544557","doi":"10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9544557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Multiple Myeloma Cancer Cells Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Multiple Myeloma Cancer Cells Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544557/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544557/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Multiple Myeloma Cancer Cells Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning","confLoc":"PUNE, India","sourcePdf":"ASIANCON2021Paper0555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07641S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544081","isNumber":"9544090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544081","xplore-issue":"9544090","articleId":"9544557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9544558,"authors":[{"name":"Venkata Gopi Mandoori","affiliation":["V R Siddhartha Engineering College, Vijayawada, India"],"firstName":"Venkata Gopi","lastName":"Mandoori","id":"37088980051"},{"name":"Radhesyam Vaddi","affiliation":["V R Siddhartha Engineering College, Vijayawada, India"],"firstName":"Radhesyam","lastName":"Vaddi","id":"37707818800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3877-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3876-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4604-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544558","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dimensionality reduction","Earth","Neural networks","Benchmark testing","Feature extraction","Data mining","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indian Pines","Salinas-A Scene","Pavia University Scene","Kennedy Space Center","Principal Component Analysis","Factor Analysis","Convolutional Neural Networks"]}],"abstract":"HSI (Hyperspectral Image) consists of more spectral bands, used for the classification of various objects on earth.

This paper focuses on deep learning and how it is applied to detect and track the objects. Deep learning works with the algorithms influenced by the layout and functionalities of the brain. The advantage of working with such algorithms is that the performance increases with increase in data which isn't the case for traditional learning algorithms whose performance stabilizes even with increase in the amount data. Real time object tracking has been at the forefront of some of the most sought out research topics in computer vision applications. Regardless of the tremendous progress made in this area, effectiveness and fidelity of accuracy in tracking the objects in real time at a substantial level still remains a grave challenge. Detection and tracking algorithms are specified in terms of extricating the features of images and videos for security and scrutiny applications. Popular algorithms of object detection include You Only Look Once (YOLO), Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), Faster RCNN (F-RCNN). RCNN has better accuracy compared to other algorithms but YOLO surpasses when speed is considered over accuracy. In YOLO, Object detection is implemented as a regression problem and class probabilities are provided for detected images.","doi":"10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544598","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544092","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544088/9544092/09544598.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object Detection and Tracking Using Yolo","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544598/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Object Detection and Tracking Using Yolo","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544598/","accessionNumber":"21160219","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object Detection and Tracking Using Yolo","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053355S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544088","isNumber":"9544092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544088","xplore-issue":"9544092","articleId":"9544598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9544606,"authors":[{"name":"Lian Ding","affiliation":["Chengdu Agricultural College, Wenjiang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Ding","id":"37088977328"},{"name":"Wei Du","affiliation":["Chengdu Agricultural College, Wenjiang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Du","id":"37088977626"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3877-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3876-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4604-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544606","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544606","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Analytical models","Image analysis","Convolution","Computational modeling","Pipelines","Morphology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","deep learning (artificial intelligence)","image processing","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel structure","nonlinear activation function mapping","deep learning","parallel cluster computing","image depth analysis","deep neural model","convolutional layer","convolutional units"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cluster Computing","Deep Learning","Depth Analysis","Image Processing","Data Structure"]}],"abstract":"This research study begins with deep learning and progresses to cluster computing to complete the image depth analysis pipeline.

Nowadays lot of information is being shared over social media and people cannot able to differentiate between which information is fake and which is real. People immediately start sharing the news without confirming its authenticity. This further results in spreading of it. Fake news and rumor are the most popular forms of false and unauthenticated information and should be detected as soon as possible for avoiding their dramatic consequences. In previous research, many fake news detection methods were proposed. In this project the final report is generated by predictions of text classification using SVM, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes and tampered image classification by Error Level Analysis using CNN.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544661","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544088/9544092/09544661.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"272","doi":"10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fake News And Tampered Image Detection In Social Networks Using Machine Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Fake News And Tampered Image Detection In Social Networks Using Machine Learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544661/","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","accessionNumber":"21160285","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544661/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fake News And Tampered Image Detection In Social Networks Using Machine Learning","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052615S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544088","isNumber":"9544092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544088","xplore-issue":"9544092","articleId":"9544661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9544669,"authors":[{"name":"Malathy.

So far, cloud storage has shown to be a feasible method for storing and processing enormous amounts of data. Due to bandwidth limits, cloud computing is projected to fail in the future years to manage the massive amounts of data created by IoT devices. Fog Computing is a more advanced technique that aims to address several flaws in large-scale IoT networks. Fog Computing is anticipated to enable mobile users near high-quality Cloud services. With low latency and high bandwidth, the Fog can supply computing power and storage space.

On the other hand, duplicate requests are often spotted on Stack Overflow and are highlighted by famous users manually. Duplicate automatic question detection lowers the effort and work of famous users. Even though actual approaches bring out textual characteristics to identify double questions automatically, such approaches are restricted as semantic information may be lost. The use of powerful depth to deal with this issue. Learning techniques including Hybrid long-term memory (HLSTM) are used for the detection of repeated stack overflow queries from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, for obtaining vector representations of the words, Word2Vec model is used. Also, the user can apprehend weekly information in full document level and word extent. For the purpose of identifying duplicate stack overflow issues, three techniques are built based on WV-CNNs and WV-HLSTM on Word2Vec, CNNs and HLSTM. The results of the elaboration show that, the WV-CNN and WV-LSTMs have notably upgraded in four basic approaches and in a series of three profound learnings. Furthermore, the test results suggested that there are four methods, basing our methods WV-CNNs and WV-HLSTM, on support of vector equipment, logic reverse control and random forest and severe gradient boost.","doi":"10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544747","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544088/9544092/09544747.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Duplicate Question Detection with Deep Learning Using Word2Vec","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Duplicate Question Detection with Deep Learning Using Word2Vec","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544747/","accessionNumber":"21160171","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544747/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Duplicate Question Detection with Deep Learning Using Word2Vec","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051833S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544088","isNumber":"9544092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544088","xplore-issue":"9544092","articleId":"9544747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9544750,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique has been a promising technology towards the present day requirements of the users. In NOMA, the signals are superimposed with different power levels for each user and then transmitted to the receiver. The receiver performs Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to distinguish and obtain the required signal. Till now, various researches have focused on SIC with perfect characteristics whereas only few research focused on imperfect SIC (ipSIC). While perfect SIC (pSIC) acts an ideal case of no loss of information and external noises, the ipSIC acts as practical scenario of data transmission in real-time environment. In this paper, we aim to obtain the performance metrics of the considered NOMA system in presence of ipSIC and compare to the performance of pSIC of the same user. More importantly, we characterize channels as \u03ba - \u00b5 fading distribution. We derive closed-form expressions of outage probability for two destinations. Meanwhile, we also perform the Monte-Carlo simulations to check the authenticity of obtained mathematical expressions.","doi":"10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9544772","publicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544081/9544090/09544772.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9544772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544090","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Grouping and Imperfect CSI for Downlink NOMA over \u03ba- \u00b5 Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"User Grouping and Imperfect CSI for Downlink NOMA over \u03ba- \u00b5 Fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544772/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544772/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Grouping and Imperfect CSI for Downlink NOMA over \u03ba- \u00b5 Fading","confLoc":"PUNE, India","sourcePdf":"ASIANCON2021Paper0608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063088S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544081","isNumber":"9544090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544081","xplore-issue":"9544090","articleId":"9544772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9544784,"authors":[{"name":"Harsuminder Kaur Gill","affiliation":["Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, India"],"firstName":"Harsuminder Kaur","lastName":"Gill","id":"37088980726"},{"name":"Vivek Kumar Sehgal","affiliation":["Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, India"],"firstName":"Vivek Kumar","lastName":"Sehgal","id":"37683821300"},{"name":"Anil Kumar Verma","affiliation":["Thapar University, Patiala, India"],"firstName":"Anil Kumar","lastName":"Verma","id":"37069945700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8402-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-7281-8400-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8401-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8403-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544784","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Technological innovation","Transfer learning","Predictive models","Physiology","Sensors","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","electrocardiography","ergonomics","medical signal processing","recurrent neural nets","sleep"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal requirement","sleep anyone","most comfortable posture","correct posture","physiological diseases","physical diseases","healthy living style","contextual body sensors","best posture prediction","sleep quality","pressure mat","wrong posture","recommended posture","RNN based framework","context sensitive information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pressure Mats","Neural Networks","Posture Analytics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544784","abstract":"Sleep quality is one of the most important features to predict a healthy living style. It relates to various physical and physiological diseases. Correct or most comfortable posture is responsible for having and predicting the quality of sleep anyone had. However, posture in which a person is sleeping is his/her personal requirement or desire. Correct posture is context sensitive information which needs to be consider when predicting sleep quality of any person. In this paper a RNN based framework is proposed which predicts posture and compare it with recommended posture of a person. If the person is sleeping in wrong posture, it generates an alert to correct the posture. The proposed framework is tested on standard dataset of sleep and pressure mat available at physionet.org. The proposed framework has an accuracy of above 90% in validation dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9544784","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544081/9544090/09544784.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","publicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9544784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sleep Quality and Best Posture Prediction using Contextual Body Sensors using LSTM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Sleep Quality and Best Posture Prediction using Contextual Body Sensors using LSTM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","accessionNumber":"21202965","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544784/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sleep Quality and Best Posture Prediction using Contextual Body Sensors using LSTM","confLoc":"PUNE, India","sourcePdf":"ASIANCON2021Paper0325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060962S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544081","isNumber":"9544090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544081","xplore-issue":"9544090","articleId":"9544784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9544789,"authors":[{"name":"Richa Kumar","affiliation":["CDAC Mohali"],"firstName":"Richa","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37088983046"},{"name":"Gaurav Verma","affiliation":["IIT Roorkee"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Verma","id":"37088984879"},{"name":"Ajit Prajapati","affiliation":["IIT Roorkee"],"firstName":"Ajit","lastName":"Prajapati","id":"37088986248"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8402-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-7281-8400-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8401-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8403-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544789","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Fading channels","Technological innovation","Patch antennas","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Patch antennas","Polarization","Quad antenna"]}],"abstract":"In the design of latest wireless devices more emphasis has been put on the miniaturization of antennas accompanying efficiency.

This paper signifies how chest X-ray images use deep learning techniques which are very useful for analyzing images to detect the virus and spotting high-risk patients for controlling the spread. Further, it shows how the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology of deep learning helps to detect the virus quickly. A CNN is a type of artificial neural network that is used for image pre-processing and consists of many layers that aid in detection. A sequential CNN model is proposed with different kernel sizes, filters, and having different parameters using a dataset of 2159 images. The output shows that a model with an adequate amount of filters, max-pooling layers, dropout layers and dense layers imparts the highest accuracy of 99.53% in detecting the coronavirus.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544088/9544092/09544791.pdf","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1053","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","doi":"10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Frameworks for COVID-19 Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Deep learning","Pandemics","Computational modeling","Tools","Coronaviruses","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep-learning","COVID-19 Detection","Chest X-ray","Convolutional Neural Network","Pre-Processing","Algorithm Implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Frameworks for COVID-19 Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544791/","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Frameworks for COVID-19 Detection","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110795S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544088","isNumber":"9544092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544088","xplore-issue":"9544092","articleId":"9544791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9544795,"authors":[{"name":"M Kavitha","affiliation":["Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation, Greenfields, Vaddeswaram, Guntur"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Kavitha","id":"37088762691"},{"name":"P V V S Srinivas","affiliation":["Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation, Greenfields, Vaddeswaram, Guntur"],"firstName":"P V V S","lastName":"Srinivas","id":"37088980242"},{"name":"P.S.Latha Kalyampudi","affiliation":["BVRIT HYDERABAD College of Engineering for Women Bachupalli, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"],"firstName":"P.S.Latha","lastName":"Kalyampudi","id":"37088979192"},{"name":"Choragudi S.

In this paper, the unsupervised clustering technique K-means, and its variation K-medoids partitioning are applied to detect anomalies. Sensor-embedded wearable devices are allowing smart healthcare services for people even in remote areas. These devices support continuous monitoring of people's health and allow the caregivers to provide better health assistance.

Load forecasting is required to be performed for different of timespan, i.e. short, medium and long term. Some machine learning based approaches were used in recent past to address this problem, however taking in account of the dependencies of load demands on load density, city and industrial plants, local and global policies there is scope of forecasting precision.

The dataset includes three months (May-July 2014) of energy consumption at hourly basis. Short-term as for the next 24 hours and medium-term forecasting for over 9 days are performed with root mean squared error 88.05 and 87.97 MW, respectively.

The traditional methods to evaluate the quality of alcohol, requires special training, costly equipment, and time-consuming procedure. An electronic nose (E- nose) with the integration of machine learning (ML) algorithms can be a reliable solution for fast and easy evaluation of alcohol quality. In this paper, design and functional aspects of E-nose architecture in alcohol industries are discussed with emphasis on the type of sensing technologies and decision-making systems. An intelligent E-nose for assessing alcohol quality is introduced in this paper.

Neural Networks (NN) become very popular and effective to train a model and get accurate result. In this article we used unsupervised NN to select and train model for cover image selection. Chaotic structures and transformation techniques like the integer wavelet transform in Steganography have good result due to minimum data loss. In this paper, we propose a cyclic chaos algorithm that produces Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG), use seeds for embedding purpose. We also used the Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) to minimize data loss and return a high-quality encoded image. Our proposed system can embed colored image. Furthermore, evident and easily understandable as well as executable. We found that our approach outperforms other recent steganography approaches in terms of improved embedding time, reduced complexity, and improved decoded image quality with increased hiding capability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Based Image Steganography Method using Cyclic Chaos and Integer Wavelet Transform","publicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","doi":"10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9544831","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544081/9544090/09544831.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9544831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544090","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Based Image Steganography Method using Cyclic Chaos and Integer Wavelet Transform","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9544831/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Based Image Steganography Method using Cyclic Chaos and Integer Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"PUNE, India","sourcePdf":"ASIANCON2021Paper0303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063652S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544081","isNumber":"9544090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544081","xplore-issue":"9544090","articleId":"9544831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9544840,"authors":[{"name":"Suman Sansanwal","affiliation":["Chandigarh University, Mohali, India"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Sansanwal","id":"37088979708"},{"name":"Nitin Jain","affiliation":["Chandigarh University, Mohali, India"],"firstName":"Nitin","lastName":"Jain","id":"37088978811"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3877-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3876-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4604-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544840","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computers","Cloud computing","Systematics","Computational modeling","Cloud computing security","Taxonomy","Data breach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Threats","Attacks","Security","Models","Vulnerabilities","Virtualization"]}],"abstract":"These days cloud computing plays very major role in the world of computers.

The reverse process, i.e., decoding and decryption logic in Python, is also done. We have implemented On-Off-Keying Non-Return-to-Zero-Inverted Modulation, On-Off-Keying Return-to-Zero Modulation, Pulse Position Modulation, Differential Pulse Interval Modulation and Dual-Header Pulse Interval Modulation schemes coupled with the RSA algorithm. The correctness of our Python codes is verified using a simple proof-of-concept model.

The presence of haze can affect the techniques of preprocessing, segmentation, and classification of outdoor images similar to aerial and Remote Sensing images used in the Land Use/ Land Cover (LU/ LC) change analysis. To remove atmospheric effects, dark channel prior-based and learning-based dehazing techniques have been suggested. Prior-based algorithms have the disadvantage of oversaturating the sky region, resulting in artifacts, and longer execution time. Image dehazing techniques based on image enhancement, image fusion, image reconstruction, image segmentation, and deep learning-based approaches are discussed in this review article. The review also discusses the techniques for obtaining minimum haze removal parameters and assigning appropriate values to dehazing attributes. The effectiveness of various techniques was assessed with metrics that were specific to the datasets. In the end, future research directions for image dehazing are rendered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544917/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Empirical Review on Image Dehazing Techniques for Change Detection of Land Cover","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Empirical Review on Image Dehazing Techniques for Change Detection of Land Cover","confLoc":"PUNE, India","sourcePdf":"ASIANCON2021Paper0290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.190535S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544081","isNumber":"9544090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544081","xplore-issue":"9544090","articleId":"9544917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":9544919,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Lei","affiliation":["Guangzhou City Polytechnic, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Lei","id":"37088978131"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3877-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3876-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4604-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9544919","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544919","abstract":"Multi-objective scheduling model of construction project based on genetic algorithm is studied in this paper.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have managed to achieve the state-of-the-art quality of the segmented image in semantic segmentation tasks. Still, the classification capability of such algorithms is not satisfactory to segment images that contain complex object boundaries and minimal regions. Recently, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) were introduced, which can solve the overfitting of the generator network using the adversarial loss. In this paper, a GAN-based segmentation model is proposed, in which the Conditional GAN (CGAN) model is used as base architecture. Feature reconstruction loss is introduced in this composite model to solve the identification and classification of visually small elements in images. A pre-trained deep convolution neural network is adopted to calculate feature reconstruction loss. The usage of Feature reconstruction loss has demonstrated the high quality of the output labels and improved segmentation masks. The evaluation of the proposed model on the cityscapes dataset has shown the effectiveness of GAN-based architecture in semantic segmentation of multiclass images. The proposed model achieved 83.3% accuracy on the cityscapes test dataset, which is superior to most semantic segmentation state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9544954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9544954","publicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544081/9544090/09544954.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Semantic Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks with a Feature Reconstruction Loss","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544954/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks with a Feature Reconstruction Loss","confLoc":"PUNE, India","sourcePdf":"ASIANCON2021Paper0927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057705S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544081","isNumber":"9544090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544081","xplore-issue":"9544090","articleId":"9544954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9544964,"authors":[{"name":"Adittya Soukarjya Saha","affiliation":["BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Adittya Soukarjya","lastName":"Saha","id":"37088980110"},{"name":"Mahmudul Haque","affiliation":["BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mahmudul","lastName":"Haque","id":"37088978615"},{"name":"Md.

To track the infections, RT-PCR and rapid testing are followed in the current situation which is time-consuming and could be an important time for severe patients. To decrease the amount of time for COVID-19 prediction, Chest X-rays could play an important role in determining the result. So by using Chest X-rays with Artificial Intelligence, the COVID-19 disease can be detected in a lesser amount of time under the guidance of the specialist. For this, the Deep Learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been proved quite successful for image recognition and classification. In this experiment, Covid-19 was detected with the help of ResNet architecture whose accuracy increases while going into deeper layers by using skip connections. ResNet is a pre-trained model on the ImageNet database. During the experiment, ResNet18 architecture was used because it has the least number of layers as compared to other CNN architectures and so, for determining the best accuracy obtained with lesser computations. Methods like k-fold cross-validation, confusion matrices, etc were used in obtaining the accuracy of around 89% for COVID-19 prediction. Hence, CNN could be a useful tool for the prediction of COVID-19 and saving time for both patients and doctors for further treatment.","doi":"10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544991","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544088/9544092/09544991.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9544991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544092","startPage":"545","endPage":"550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of COVID-19 Disease with Chest X-Rays Using Convolutional Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9544991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of COVID-19 Disease with Chest X-Rays Using Convolutional Neural Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9544991/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9544991/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014355","fundingName":"Nirma University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of COVID-19 Disease with Chest X-Rays Using Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"99.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087758S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544088","isNumber":"9544092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544088","xplore-issue":"9544092","articleId":"9544991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9545000,"authors":[{"name":"P Raji","affiliation":["Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore"],"firstName":"P","lastName":"Raji","id":"37088982023"},{"name":"H S Prashantha","affiliation":["Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore"],"firstName":"H S","lastName":"Prashantha","id":"37086281265"},{"name":"Naureen Nazakath Nisar","affiliation":["Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Naureen Nazakath","lastName":"Nisar","id":"37088986145"},{"name":"Sheetal D Sulakhe","affiliation":["Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Sheetal D","lastName":"Sulakhe","id":"37088986138"},{"name":"S Gita","affiliation":["Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Gita","id":"37088983970"},{"name":"M Shivani","affiliation":["Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Shivani","id":"37088985532"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8402-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-7281-8400-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8401-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8403-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9545000","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Deep learning","Training","Visualization","Transfer learning","Sensitivity and specificity","Coronaviruses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["covid","Vgg16","ResNet50","Inceptionv3","Xception","X-ray","CNN"]}],"abstract":"Novel Coronavirus is an infectious disease, whose outbreak has brought human life to a standstill.

It is a disease that can spread from humans to humans through physical contact with the infected droplets or via airborne. It has been scientifically proven that wearing a face mask is the most effective method against the virus. This paper's aim is to develop a face mask detector which could be used to make mitigation, evaluation, prevention, and action plans against COVID-19 pandemic by the authorities. In this study, the face mask detection is developed based on the image classification method called Mobile_NetV2. The pseudo-steps for making the detector model are accumulating data, pre-processing, breakdown of the data, training the model, and implementation of the model. The proposed model is able to detect the people with or without a face mask with an accuracy of 96.85 percent. The experimental results of the model have been performed on real-time applications. The mask detector is also able to detect the face mask on a moving subject with expected accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach for Face Mask Detection using Tensorflow for Covid-19","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","doi":"10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9545019","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544088/9544092/09545019.pdf","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9545019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9545019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach for Face Mask Detection using Tensorflow for Covid-19","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9545019/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach for Face Mask Detection using Tensorflow for Covid-19","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042472S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544088","isNumber":"9544092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544088","xplore-issue":"9544092","articleId":"9545019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9545035,"authors":[{"name":"Vamsi Krishna Varigonda","affiliation":["SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, India"],"firstName":"Vamsi","lastName":"Krishna Varigonda","id":"37088985040"},{"name":"Advait Borole","affiliation":["SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, India"],"firstName":"Advait","lastName":"Borole","id":"37088982615"},{"name":"Ajay Hudge","affiliation":["SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, India"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Hudge","id":"37088984169"},{"name":"Chitransh Yadav","affiliation":["SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, India"],"firstName":"Chitransh","lastName":"Yadav","id":"37088981444"},{"name":"Vinoth Kumar Annamalai","affiliation":["SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, India"],"firstName":"Vinoth","lastName":"Kumar Annamalai","id":"37088987389"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8402-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-7281-8400-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8401-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8403-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9545035","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Limiting","Supply chains","Urban areas","Authentication","Transportation","Unmanned aerial vehicles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Last Mile Delivery","VTOL","Autonomous Vehicles","Supply chain Infrastructure"]}],"abstract":"Access to critical medicines is hindered throughout the world due to inadequate transportation, communication, or supply chain infrastructure. Numerous immunization programs in underdeveloped and developing countries face countless challenges in getting life-saving vaccines to those who need them the most. During the Covid-19 period, the shortcomings of the medical supply chain and delivery system were evident. Unmanned aerial vehicles play a vital role in delivering medical supplies; however, conventional multi-rotors have a limited flight time, which defines the range of the missions, whereas a plane has the capability of conducting long-range missions. Shortcomings of using planes for the operation is the need for a runway, limiting its reach in an urban environment due to the unavailability of space. We are proposing a multi-configuration unmanned aerial vehicle for medical supplies delivery. It is also referred to as Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), which can take off, and land without the need for the runway. Furthermore has extended operational range compared to the multi-rotors given its functional behavior as a plane. We have emulated aerial vehicles' configurations with real-life mission parameters and compared them with our proposed Unmanned aerial vehicles model. The design, fabrication process of the multi-configuration unmanned aerial vehicle for the medical supplies delivery is explained in detail in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9545035","publicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544081/9544090/09545035.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASIANCON51346.2021.9545035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility of Multi-Configuration Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Last Mile Delivery of Medical Supplies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9545035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545035/","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility of Multi-Configuration Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Last Mile Delivery of Medical Supplies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9545035/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility of Multi-Configuration Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Last Mile Delivery of Medical Supplies","confLoc":"PUNE, India","sourcePdf":"ASIANCON2021Paper0116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059563S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544081","isNumber":"9544090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544081","xplore-issue":"9544090","articleId":"9545035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9545041,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Autoencoder is one of the techniques in artificial neural network to analyze and predict a huge volume of data with different many features. This technique has three stages namely the first one is encoding, second one is compression and third one is decoding. Denoising autoencoder is an enhanced technique for image processing to reconstruct the damaged image to original image.

Internet access allows to control doors all over the world by a simple mobile application. The app developed can be used in two modes ADMIN and GUEST mode. The ADMIN mode is protected by pin/password and is encrypted by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The password can be stored in the Key store and it can be changed whenever required. The ADMIN mode has the privilege to authenticate the GUEST mode to access all doors. For GUEST mode authentication, guests have to request the admin by using the app. Firebase is used as a server where the device and the mobile app are connected to it. Firebase is fast and accurate and hence can be accessed quickly. The main advantage of this proposed method is that it is fully operated through Internet so it can locked/unlocked wherever from the world. Comparative analysis is taken for three algorithms i.e., AES, DES and 3-DES and AES algorithm has given the best results in terms of execution time and memory usage and is implemented in the hardware lock. The experimental results give the screen shots of the app in guest and admin mode, firebase data and hardware real time implementation of the smart lock on a door.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Key using AES Algorithm","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","doi":"10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9545058","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544088/9544092/09545058.pdf","startPage":"467","endPage":"473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIRCA51532.2021.9545058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9545058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Smart Key using AES Algorithm","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9545058/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Key using AES Algorithm","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05791S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544088","isNumber":"9544092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544088","xplore-issue":"9544092","articleId":"9545058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9545075,"authors":[{"name":"Shivalee Negi","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Uttarakhand, India"],"firstName":"Shivalee","lastName":"Negi","id":"37088986671"},{"name":"Yatender Singh Kushwaha","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Uttarakhand, India"],"firstName":"Yatender Singh","lastName":"Kushwaha","id":"37088985552"},{"name":"Prakash Dwivedi","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Uttarakhand, India"],"firstName":"Prakash","lastName":"Dwivedi","id":"37086281819"},{"name":"Sourav Bose","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Uttarakhand, India"],"firstName":"Sourav","lastName":"Bose","id":"37086840661"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8402-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-7281-8400-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8401-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8403-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9545075","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Codes","VHDL","Very high speed integrated circuits","Hardware","Software","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Array)","PID(Proportional Integrator Derivative)","FOPID(Fractional Order Proportional Integrator Derivative)","VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language)","PWM(Pulse Width Modulation)"]}],"abstract":"Analog control techniques have been used for a long time to control the dc-dc converter due to their directness and ease of realization.

In multi-bit flipping successive cancellation (MFSC) algorithm, the unreliable bits are respectively corrected according to the single-bit flipping and multi-bit flipping rules. In single flipping successive cancellation list (SFSCL) algorithm, by subtracting a large penalty value from the path metric (PM) value of the unreliable bit, the decoding path corresponding to this bit is more likely to be pruned during path screening, so as to realize bit flipping indirectly.

However, the traditional APF has problems such as the local minima and the target unreachability. These problems can be solved by improving repulsive potential and attractive potential. So, following researches are carried out in this paper. Firstly, a kind of improved repulsive potential is introduced to solve the traditional target unreachable problem due to the goal with obstacles nearby. Then, one improved attractive potential is proposed to solve the common local minima problem in APF method. However, the improved attractive potential may cause a rotation around the target. To solve this problem, attractive potential is improved again. Finally, a series of simulation experiments are carried out and the simulation results show that the proposed method can plan an effective path and has a strong robustness.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSSE52761.2021.9545105","startPage":"136","endPage":"142","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 7th International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering (ICCSSE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSSE52761.2021.9545105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544505","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 7th International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering (ICCSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544085/9544505/09545105.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Research on Target Unreachable Problem of Path Planning Based on Artificial Potential Field for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545105/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Research on Target Unreachable Problem of Path Planning Based on Artificial Potential Field for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9545105/","accessionNumber":"21136589","publicationDate":"30 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2021-Aug. 1 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Research on Target Unreachable Problem of Path Planning Based on Artificial Potential Field for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"July_Qingdao_32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077503S","chronDate":"July 30 2021-Aug. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544085","isNumber":"9544505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544085","xplore-issue":"9544505","articleId":"9545105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9545107,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Liang","affiliation":["Wuhan Second Ship Design and Research Institute, Wuhan, P.R.

This paper develops an adaptive nonlinear transform algorithm for enhancing anti-attack ability of communication system. The nonlinear characteristic which is transparent to authorized consumer, is added to the linear modulated signal. The useful information is hidden in nonlinear distorted signal which seems to be meaningless. For non-cooperative receiver, the obstacle of nonlinearity is produced in receiving and judging process. On the other hand, cooperative receiver can successfully obtain the information by inverse nonlinear transform using private key. A blind identification of adaptive nonlinear control for inverse nonlinear transform is proposed. Experimental results on simulation show that with the proposed technique, the Spurs-Free-Dynamic-Range with 16QAM signal after nonlinear transform is 31dB worse than that of before nonlinear transform. The 16QAM signal can be recovered by inverse transform.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSSE52761.2021.9545107","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 7th International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering (ICCSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9544085/9544505/09545107.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9544505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSSE52761.2021.9545107","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 7th International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering (ICCSSE)","startPage":"6","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse Control of Nonlinear Distortion in Adaptive System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9545107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2021-Aug. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"Inverse Control of Nonlinear Distortion in Adaptive System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545107/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9545107/","publicationDate":"30 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse Control of Nonlinear Distortion in Adaptive System","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"July_Qingdao_08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.172543S","chronDate":"July 30 2021-Aug. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544085","isNumber":"9544505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544085","xplore-issue":"9544505","articleId":"9545107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":9545136,"authors":[{"name":"Kala H S","affiliation":["MVJ College of Engineering, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Kala H","lastName":"S","id":"37088976194"},{"name":"Bindu G B","affiliation":["MVJ College of Engineering, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Bindu G","lastName":"B","id":"37088976323"},{"name":"Harshini M P","affiliation":["MVJ College of Engineering, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Harshini M","lastName":"P","id":"37088976121"},{"name":"Akshay D L","affiliation":["MVJ College of Engineering, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Akshay D","lastName":"L","id":"37088975523"},{"name":"Anusha V","affiliation":["MVJ College of Engineering, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Anusha","lastName":"V","id":"37088975407"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2569-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2570-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9545136","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"abstract":"The country's \"Democracy\" permits citizens to elect their representatives, and we must ensure that the power granted to them is properly employed.

A dynamic model of the DEA is built, which is composed of an asymmetric hysteresis model, a creep model and a linear system. To compensate the hysteresis and creep nonlinearities of the DEA, an inverse compensation feedforward controller (ICFC) is designed based on the creep model and the inverse of the asymmetric hysteresis model. Besides, an extended state observer (ESO) is designed to estimate the unmeasurable state of the DEA, as well as uncertainties including the modeling errors, parameter perturbations and external disturbances. Then, a sliding mode feedback controller (SMFC) is designed cooperating with the ICFC to realize the high precision tracking control of the DEA. The convergence of the ESO and the whole control system are proved through the Lyapunov method. Finally, some experiments are executed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2021-Aug. 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545162/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"30 July 2021","conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9545162/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Tracking Control for Dielectric Elastomer Actuator with Sliding Mode Feedback Controller","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Tracking Control for Dielectric Elastomer Actuator with Sliding Mode Feedback Controller","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"July_Qingdao_41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082036S","chronDate":"July 30 2021-Aug. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9544085","isNumber":"9544505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9544085","xplore-issue":"9544505","articleId":"9545162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":9545167,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Ren","affiliation":["Ontario Tech U, Oshawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ren","id":"37088901411"},{"name":"Xishi Huang","affiliation":["RS Opto Tech Ltd., Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xishi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088974983"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4405-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4404-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4406-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9545167","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Simulation","Transportation","Training data","Reinforcement learning","Systems engineering and theory","Path planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep reinforcement learning","deep learning","potential fields","path planning"]}],"abstract":"Using mobile robots for transportation in a warehouse is becoming more and more common. Compared with human staff, these robots can handle the goods more accurately and more efficiently. Using robots can greatly reduce the operation cost of a warehouse. Optimal path planning for these robots can reduce the transportation time, guarantee the safety of the people in the warehouse, and reduce the goods delivery time and increase daily output. In this paper, we propose an optimal path planning algorithm for the mobile robot using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Potential fields are employed to guide to collect better quality training data to improve data efficiency.

To avert that long latency, the host system using a black-box model has chased the storage performance. On the other hand, other storage systems have required expensive storage hardware or depended on idle timing. This paper proposes an FTL-aware host system extracting the FTL metadata from the storage during runtime to overcome these constraints. Furthermore, this novel host system predicts the garbage collection and directs the storage to lower the long latency in advance. The experiment results show the alleviation of the long latency against the legacy host system.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA52859.2021.00029","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 27th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 27th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9545083/9545265/09545273.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9545265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA52859.2021.00029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FTL-Aware Host System Alleviating Severe Long Latency of NAND Flash-based Storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"An FTL-Aware Host System Alleviating Severe Long Latency of NAND Flash-based Storage","htmlLink":"/document/9545273/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FTL-Aware Host System Alleviating Severe Long Latency of NAND Flash-based Storage","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"418800a189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086691S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9545083","isNumber":"9545265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9545083","xplore-issue":"9545265","articleId":"9545273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9545276,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Binder","affiliation":["CEA, List, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Binder","id":"37087322855"},{"name":"Mihail Asavoae","affiliation":["CEA, List, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"],"firstName":"Mihail","lastName":"Asavoae","id":"37860310700"},{"name":"Belgacem Ben Hedia","affiliation":["CEA, List, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"],"firstName":"Belgacem Ben","lastName":"Hedia","id":"37085795937"},{"name":"Florian Brandner","affiliation":["T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris, LTCI, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Brandner","id":"37545420500"},{"name":"Mathieu Jan","affiliation":["CEA, List, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Jan","id":"37088975394"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4188-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4189-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-1271"}],"articleNumber":"9545276","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Out of order","Program processors","Conferences","Real-time systems","Software","Timing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Formal Methods","Model Checking","Timing Anomalies"]}],"abstract":"Correctness is an important concern during the development of real-time systems. In addition to the functional correctness, the timing behavior is often formally verified in order to ensure that correct results are delivered in-time for all possible execution conditions. The timing behavior of real-time software is thus often validated through a rigorous timing analysis that aims at determining the worst-case execution time.Timing anomalies present a major obstacle during the validation of timing properties on modern computer platforms. Out-of-order execution and concurrent accesses to shared resources may sometimes lead to \u2013 at first sight \u2013 surprising timing behavior.

To further improve cell density, multi-level cell (MLC) STT-RAM has been proposed and widely adopted. However, applying MLC STT-RAM to LLC might suffer from both write disturbance (WD) and read disturbance (RD). WD that needs two-step write operations to write data in MLC STT-RAM cell incurs extra energy consumption and latency overhead. RD means that reading data from a cell will also disturb the original data. In this paper, we propose a read/write disturbance-aware (RWDA) design for MLC STT-RAM-based cache to reduce the overhead caused by the WD and RD. We delay restore operations to mitigate the adverse impacts of disturbances. Instead of the typical LRU replacement policy, we propose a priority-based victim selection policy to meet the very distinct characteristics of MLC STT-RAM. Since accessing soft bits is much more beneficial than accessing hard bits in terms of access latency and energy consumption, we adopt a swapping mechanism to exchange frequently accessed data from hard bits to soft bits. The experimental results showed that the proposed design could averagely achieve 26.6% energy-consumption reduction and 29.5% IPC of system-performance improvement, compared with the conventional design of MLC STT-RAM cache.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA52859.2021.00009","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 27th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 27th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9545083/9545265/09545280.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA52859.2021.00009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9545265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Read/Write Disturbance-Aware Design for MLC STT-RAM-based Cache","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Read/Write Disturbance-Aware Design for MLC STT-RAM-based Cache","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9545280/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545280/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Read/Write Disturbance-Aware Design for MLC STT-RAM-based Cache","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"418800a011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073763S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9545083","isNumber":"9545265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9545083","xplore-issue":"9545265","articleId":"9545280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":9545281,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Belluardo","affiliation":["TeCIP Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Belluardo","id":"37088976243"},{"name":"Andrea Stevanato","affiliation":["TeCIP Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Stevanato","id":"37088909283"},{"name":"Daniel Casini","affiliation":["TeCIP Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy","Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Casini","id":"37086597050"},{"name":"Giorgiomaria Cicero","affiliation":["TeCIP Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgiomaria","lastName":"Cicero","id":"37086374942"},{"name":"Alessandro Biondi","affiliation":["TeCIP Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy","Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Biondi","id":"38062004600"},{"name":"Giorgio Buttazzo","affiliation":["TeCIP Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy","Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Buttazzo","id":"37284746800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4188-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4189-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-1271"}],"articleNumber":"9545281","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"abstract":"This work aims at making Apollo, a popular autonomous driving framework, safer and more secure by designing a multi-domain architecture, where its components are split between a feature-rich domain running Linux and a critical domain running a real-time operating system (RTOS).

In this paper, we first propose a simple yet expressive model which abstracts a parallel task as a single computation unit, and then, present a sufficient condition for timing-anomaly free scheduling of such units. On top of this, we design an algorithm for scheduling a set of periodic parallel tasks, represented as DAG with non-preemptive subtasks, on multicore processors. The algorithm has several desirable properties, including timing-anomaly freedom, high resource utilization, and low memory requirement. Timing-anomaly freedom enables an exact schedulability test for the algorithm, which, as shown in our evaluations, provides a significantly high schedulability ratio compared to those state-of-the-art methods that suffer from timing anomalies.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA52859.2021.00022","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 27th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 27th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9545083/9545265/09545289.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA52859.2021.00022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9545265","startPage":"119","endPage":"128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing-Anomaly Free Dynamic Scheduling of Periodic DAG Tasks with Non-Preemptive Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9545289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Timing-Anomaly Free Dynamic Scheduling of Periodic DAG Tasks with Non-Preemptive Nodes","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545289/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9545289/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing-Anomaly Free Dynamic Scheduling of Periodic DAG Tasks with Non-Preemptive Nodes","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"418800a119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079579S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9545083","isNumber":"9545265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9545083","xplore-issue":"9545265","articleId":"9545289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9545296,"authors":[{"name":"N.S Aswathy","affiliation":["IIT Guwahati, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"N.S","lastName":"Aswathy","id":"37088976945"},{"name":"Hemangee K.

However, PCM comes with its own drawbacks. Although, the performances of DRAM and PCM are comparable for memory reads, PCM is about three times slower in terms of write latency, and suffers from significantly lower write endurance. The high write latency of PCM may be detrimental to delivered QoS and may lead to deadline misses in real-time systems. To circumvent the problem, this paper proposes a novel memory scheduling scheme which employs separate write request buffer in order to prioritize reads over writes. The read requests are scheduled using an urgency based scheduler where urgency depends on allowable response times of tasks. The write requests are serviced when there are no pending reads using a similar urgency based scheduler as used for read requests. Experimental evaluation using standard benchmarks reveal that the proposed scheme is able to achieve better normalized QoS compared to existing scheduling techniques for PCM and comparable access latencies with respect to DRAM.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA52859.2021.00021","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 27th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 27th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9545083/9545265/09545296.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA52859.2021.00021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9545265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9545296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Soft Real-time Memory Request Scheduler for Phase Change Memory Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545296/","displayDocTitle":"A Soft Real-time Memory Request Scheduler for Phase Change Memory Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9545296/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Soft Real-time Memory Request Scheduler for Phase Change Memory Systems","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"418800a109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094543S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9545083","isNumber":"9545265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9545083","xplore-issue":"9545265","articleId":"9545296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9545950,"authors":[{"name":"Tiao Tan","affiliation":["Central South University, Changsha, China 410000"],"firstName":"Tiao","lastName":"Tan","id":"37088975815"},{"name":"Ming Zhao","affiliation":["Central South University, Changsha, China 410000"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37088976330"},{"name":"Yusen Zhu","affiliation":["Hunan University, Changsha, China 410000"],"firstName":"Yusen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37088975556"},{"name":"Zhiwen Zeng","affiliation":["Central South University, Changsha, China 410000"],"firstName":"Zhiwen","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37652029200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4932-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4933-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1545-0678"}],"articleNumber":"9545950","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Costs","Conferences","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Relaxation methods","Delays","Servers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile edge computing","unmanned aerial vehicle","unloading decision","joint optimization problem","USS algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Due to the increase of mobile applications and their users, and the limited coverage of infrastructure, computing resources will inevitably become insufficient. Motivated by this, we consider a UAV-assisted mobile edge computing system with multiple users, an edge server, a remote cloud server, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Unmanned aerial vehicles can provide users with a wide range of communication and certain computing power. It can not only process the tasks received by users but also unload the tasks to the edge server or the cloud server. Our proposed scheme aims to optimize the unloading decision of the tasks among all users and the allocation of computing and communication resources so as to minimize the overall energy consumption and the costs of computing and maximum delay. In order to solve the joint optimization problem, we propose an efficient USS algorithm, which includes UAV location optimization algorithm, semi-qualitative relaxation method, and self-adaptive adjustment method. Our numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the unloading cost of multi-user task compared with other four unloading decisions such as traditional cloud computing which only uses the edge server.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW53096.2021.00011","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9545463/9545911/09545950.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW53096.2021.00011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9545911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Offloading and Resource Allocation of UAV-assisted Mobile Edge Computing with Delay Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9545950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545950/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Offloading and Resource Allocation of UAV-assisted Mobile Edge Computing with Delay Constraints","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9545950/","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004735","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Offloading and Resource Allocation of UAV-assisted Mobile Edge Computing with Delay Constraints","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"493200a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090696S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9545463","isNumber":"9545911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9545463","xplore-issue":"9545911","articleId":"9545950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9545956,"authors":[{"name":"Beibei Zhang","affiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Beibei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088976112"},{"name":"Tian Xiang","affiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37088975338"},{"name":"Hongxuan Zhang","affiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hongxuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088975656"},{"name":"Te Li","affiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Te","lastName":"Li","id":"37088975486"},{"name":"Shiqiang Zhu","affiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shiqiang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37088975713"},{"name":"Jianjun Gu","affiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Gu","id":"37088976820"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4932-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4933-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1545-0678"}],"articleNumber":"9545956","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic DNN Decomposition for Lossless Synergistic Inference","abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) sustain high performance in today\u2019s data processing applications. DNN inference is resource-intensive thus is difficult to fit into a mobile device. To solve this problem, recent advances unleash DNN services using the edge computing paradigm. The existing approaches split a DNN into two parts and deploy the two partitions to computation nodes at two edge computing tiers. Nonetheless, these methods overlook collaborative device-edge-cloud computation resources. Besides, previous algorithms demand the whole DNN re-partitioning to adapt to computation resource changes and network dynamics. Moreover, for resource-demanding convolutional layers, prior works do not give a parallel processing strategy without loss of accuracy at the edge side. To tackle these issues, we propose D\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n, a dynamic DNN decomposition system for synergistic inference without precision loss. The proposed system introduces a heuristic algorithm named horizontal partition algorithm to split a DNN into three parts. The algorithm partially adjust the partitions at run time according to processing time and network conditions. At the edge side, a vertical separation module separates feature maps into tiles that can be independently run on different edge nodes in parallel. Extensive quantitative evaluation of five popular DNNs illustrates that D\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts up to 3.4\u00d7 in end-to-end DNN inference time and reduces backbone network communication overhead up to 3.68\u00d7.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Heuristic algorithms","Conferences","Parallel processing","Dynamic scheduling","Inference algorithms","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed computing","Edge computing","DNN inference acceleration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9545956","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW53096.2021.00010","startPage":"13","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9545463/9545911/09545956.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9545911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW53096.2021.00010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9545956/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic DNN Decomposition for Lossless Synergistic Inference","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9545956/","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic DNN Decomposition for Lossless Synergistic Inference","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"493200a013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100878S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9545463","isNumber":"9545911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9545463","xplore-issue":"9545911","articleId":"9545956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9545992,"authors":[{"name":"Caigen Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Yancheng Teachers University, Yancheng, China"],"firstName":"Caigen","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37276315300"},{"name":"Jianjiang Yu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Yancheng Teachers University, Yancheng, China"],"firstName":"Jianjiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278399100"},{"name":"Jinsen Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinsen","lastName":"Hu","id":"37088976134"},{"name":"Yifan Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Hu","id":"37088976623"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2490-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2491-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9545992","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memory","Recurrent neural networks","Stability criteria","Neurons","Training data","Numerical simulation","Robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-binary associative memory","activation function reconstruction","stability","continuous time neural networks","time delays"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Non-binary Associative Memory based on Continuous Recurrent Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/CAIBDA53561.2021.00024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9545914","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Algorithms (CAIBDA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Algorithms (CAIBDA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9545464/9545914/09545992.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAIBDA53561.2021.00024","startPage":"76","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9545992","abstract":"Neural networks have important applications in associative memory design.

The weights are designed under the networks parameters inequality constraints instead of learning from training data. Meanwhile, the influence of time delay is considered.

The distribution takes a long time to evaluate since rare failure events lie in its long and heavily skewed tail. Moreover, advanced FinFET technologies are becoming increasingly reliant on assist techniques to resolve these rare failures in the tail for improved dynamic performance and stability. In this work, we present various analytical approaches that work well in both super-threshold and subthreshold regions of operation to quickly determine the write-access failure probability. For FinFET based SRAMs, we present a modified sensitivity analysis-based method to evaluate the write-access operation distribution and discuss the evaluation of contention-limited write-access failures. The impact of various write-assist techniques on the performance and stability of FinFET SRAMs is also discussed. All simulations are performed using commercial 65nm bulk planar and 12nm FinFET technologies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Write V<sub>MIN</sub> and Yield Estimation for Nanoscale SRAMs","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3110484","endPage":"5048","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09546040.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"5038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3110484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546040","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FinFETs","Random access memory","Analytical models","Gaussian distribution","Delays","Stability criteria","Circuit stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit-cell","failure probability","noise margin","write-access","SRAM","subthreshold","VMIN","yield"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Write V<sub>MIN</sub> and Yield Estimation for Nanoscale SRAMs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"68","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9546040/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)","grantNumber":"FA8650-18-2-7844"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Write V<sub>MIN</sub> and Yield Estimation for Nanoscale SRAMs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-gupta-3110484-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058973S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9546040","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9546041,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoling Wang","affiliation":["College of Automation and AI, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China","Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9546041/wang-3111870-small.gif","p":["Xiaoling Wang is an Associate Professor at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

Motivated by the interval observer of single-agent systems, a distributed interval observer is designed for MASs communicating through a directed network which contains a directed spanning tree by using only the bounding information on the uncertainties and the output information, to implement the interval-valued state estimation on the absolute state of each agent. It also finds that the robust coordination control is a by-part of the distributed interval observer design of this kind of MASs. Moreover, a time-invariant transformation is used to perfect the distributed interval observer design. Finally, numerical simulations are proposed to verify the theoretical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interval Observer-Based Robust Coordination Control of Multi-Agent Systems Over Directed Networks","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3111870","endPage":"5155","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09546041.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"5145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3111870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546041","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Uncertainty","Output feedback","Noise measurement","Multi-agent systems","Directed graphs","Control systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-agent system","coordination","interval observer","uncertainty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interval Observer-Based Robust Coordination Control of Multi-Agent Systems Over Directed Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546041/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"68","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9546041/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61803209, 61991412 and 61873326"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20180752"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011343","fundingName":"Foundation of Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"Scip202006"},{"fundingName":"Program for HUST Academic Frontier Youth Team","grantNumber":"2018QYTD07"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2019CFA005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interval Observer-Based Robust Coordination Control of Multi-Agent Systems Over Directed Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsi-su-3111870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120193S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9546041","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9546047,"authors":[{"name":"Fereshteh Behbahani","affiliation":["Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Fereshteh Behbahani received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Lorestan University, Khorramabad, Iran.

The proposed ternary hardware at the circuit level shows, on average, 74% improvements regarding power delay-product (PDP) compared to the CNTFET-based counterparts. Our comprehensive simulations indicate that the proposed NC-CNTFET-based hardware shows a 40% improvement in data loss, 2.2 times improvement in performance ratio, and 1.14 times improvement in Pratt\u2019s figure-of-merit, respectively, compared to the related designs.

Tactile sensors arrays will need to exhibit the desired sensing capabilities, show robustness to external influences as well as good approaches for the integration of large amounts of sensors. We present a tactile sensor array technology, based on the fabrication of a flexible interconnection substrate containing directly integrated tactile sensors. This approach has several advantages: interconnection substrate technology is widely available making upscaling of sensor arrays easy to a large amount of sensors and/or large sensing areas, the direct integration of sensors allows for a simple and very compact approach to densely packed sensor arrays and the structured flexible substrate enables integration into complex, three-dimensional bodies. We present sensors with a size of 600 \u03bcm and arrays of up to 12 x 12 individually addressable sensors. The sensors have a wide measurement range; free membrane deformation results in a high sensitivity of 2.6 kPa\u207b\u00b9 respectively 2600 N\u207b\u00b9 for small applied pressures (0-0.6 kPa) whereas deforming polymer studs extend the measurement range for larger applied pressures (5-25 kPa) with a sensitivity of 0.022 kPa\u207b\u00b9 respectively 22 N\u207b\u00b9. A statistical study of six sensor arrays from three wafers showed repeatable performance of the fabricated structures and robustness tests proved the stable sensing conditions over 10'000 cycles.

To enable compute-intensive DL algorithms, commercial-off-the-shelf processors, including FPGAs and system-on-chips, are often employed for their superior performance, energy-efficiency, and affordability compared to traditional radiation-hardened alternatives; however, these processors are highly susceptible to radiation-induced single-event effects (SEEs) that can degrade the dependability of DL applications. Researchers have created a diverse collection of DL models that perform a variety of tasks useful for Earth-observation missions. However, due to characteristic differences between models and accelerators, their tradeoffs can vary in terms of accuracy, area, performance, energy-efficiency, and dependability, which are factors crucial for resource-constrained and mission-critical systems. To select the optimal DL solution that maximizes inference performance, conserves onboard resources, and satisfies mission dependability requirements, a methodology is required to evaluate and compare the tradeoffs between competing options. In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating and analyzing the tradeoffs of FPGA-accelerated DL models, including a hierarchical fault-injection approach to accelerate the characterization of SEE susceptibility of DL solutions in terms of well-established dependability metrics. Furthermore, we identify performance and dependability trends, analyze the impact of SEEs on the inference accuracy, and predict design fault rates for near-Earth orbital environments. To demonstrate the versatility of our methodology, we evaluate and analyze four semantic-segmentation models accelerated on four Xilinx Deep-Learning Processing Unit accelerators.","doi":"10.1109/SCC49971.2021.00022","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Space Computing Conference (SCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Space Computing Conference (SCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9546270/9546271/09546280.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC49971.2021.00022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9546271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology for Evaluating and Analyzing FPGA-Accelerated, Deep-Learning Applications for Onboard Space Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546280/","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology for Evaluating and Analyzing FPGA-Accelerated, Deep-Learning Applications for Onboard Space Processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9546280/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology for Evaluating and Analyzing FPGA-Accelerated, Deep-Learning Applications for Onboard Space Processing","confLoc":"Laurel, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"240000a143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083318S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546270","isNumber":"9546271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546270","xplore-issue":"9546271","articleId":"9546280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9546283,"authors":[{"name":"Angel Yanguas-Gil","affiliation":["Applied Materials Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Angel","lastName":"Yanguas-Gil","id":"37086392375"},{"name":"Jaehoon Koo","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jaehoon","lastName":"Koo","id":"37088976866"},{"name":"Sandeep Madireddy","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Madireddy","id":"37086175339"},{"name":"Prasanna Balaprakash","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Prasanna","lastName":"Balaprakash","id":"38581290700"},{"name":"Jeffrey W.

Serverless computing offers a simplified solution: users deploy models as serverless functions and let the platform handle provisioning and scaling. However, serverless functions have constrained resources in CPU and memory, making them inefficient or infeasible to serve large neural networks-which have become increasingly popular. In this paper, we present Gillis, a serverless-based model serving system that automatically partitions a large model across multiple serverless functions for faster inference and reduced memory footprint per function. Gillis employs two novel model partitioning algorithms that respectively achieve latency-optimal serving and cost-optimal serving with SLO compliance. We have implemented Gillis on three serverless platforms-AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and KNIX-with MXNet as the serving backend. Experimental evaluations against popular models show that Gillis supports serving very large neural networks, reduces the inference latency substantially, and meets various SLOs with a low serving cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546452/","accessionNumber":"21202499","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9546452/","publicationDate":"July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Gillis: Serving Large Neural Networks in Serverless Functions with Automatic Model Partitioning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gillis: Serving Large Neural Networks in Serverless Functions with Automatic Model Partitioning","confLoc":"DC, USA","sourcePdf":"451300a138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134879S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546301","isNumber":"9546401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546301","xplore-issue":"9546401","articleId":"9546452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9546488,"authors":[{"name":"Weida Zhong","affiliation":["State University of New York at Buffalo"],"firstName":"Weida","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37086203140"},{"name":"Qiuling Suo","affiliation":["State University of New York at Buffalo"],"firstName":"Qiuling","lastName":"Suo","id":"37086272339"},{"name":"Xiaowei Jia","affiliation":["University of Pittsburgh"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Jia","id":"37085462661"},{"name":"Aidong Zhang","affiliation":["University of Virginia"],"firstName":"Aidong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37276880200"},{"name":"Lu Su","affiliation":["Purdue University"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Su","id":"37085423252"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4513-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4514-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-8411"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"9546488","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Correlation","Recurrent neural networks","Roads","Urban areas","Distributed databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","data analysis","graph theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile computing","neural nets","recurrent neural nets","road traffic","spatiotemporal phenomena","telecommunication traffic","traffic engineering computing","traffic information systems","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous spatio-temporal Graph convolution network","traffic forecasting","accurate traffic prediction","intelligent traffic management","large-scale road sensing data","connected wireless sensors","sensory data","data acquisition","traffic data","traffic prediction task","state-of-the-art ML-based traffic prediction models","Graph Convolutional Networks","spatial completion","temporal completion","GCN-based methods","static graph","road segment","heterogeneous spatio-temporal prediction framework","incomplete historical data","multiple graphs","recurrent neural networks","temporal correlations","real-world traffic prediction systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic prediction","graph neural network","data imputation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546488","abstract":"Accurate traffic prediction is indispensable for intelligent traffic management. The availability of large-scale road sensing data collected by connected wireless sensors and mobile devices have provided unrealized potential for traffic prediction. However, sensory data is often incomplete due to various factors in the process of data acquisition and transmission. The missingness of traffic data brings a key challenge to the traffic prediction task since the state-of-the-art ML-based traffic prediction models (e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)) often rely on spatial and temporal completion of the data. Moreover, existing GCN-based methods usually build a static graph based on geographical distances and are limited in their ability to capture the time-evolving relationships amongst road segments. In this paper, we develop a heterogeneous spatio-temporal prediction framework for traffic prediction using incomplete historical data. In the framework, we build multiple graphs to explicitly model the dynamic correlations among road segments from both geographical and historical aspects, and employ recurrent neural networks to capture temporal correlations for each road segment. We impute missing values in a recurrent process, which is seamlessly embedded in the prediction framework so they can be jointly trained. The proposed framework is evaluated on a public dataset of static sensors and a private dataset collected by our roving sensor system. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-art methods, and indicate the potential to be deployed into real-world traffic prediction systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00073","startPage":"707","endPage":"717","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9546401","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9546301/9546401/09546488.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network for Traffic Forecasting with Missing Values","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546488/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network for Traffic Forecasting with Missing Values","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9546488/","accessionNumber":"21202442","publicationDate":"July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network for Traffic Forecasting with Missing Values","confLoc":"DC, USA","sourcePdf":"451300a707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123093S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546301","isNumber":"9546401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546301","xplore-issue":"9546401","articleId":"9546488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9546491,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaowu Huang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaowu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37087407585"},{"name":"Fang Dong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086022718"},{"name":"Dian Shen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dian","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085392727"},{"name":"Junxue Zhang","affiliation":["SING Lab, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Junxue","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088982492"},{"name":"Huitian Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Huitian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087407681"},{"name":"Guangxing Cai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guangxing","lastName":"Cai","id":"37087408733"},{"name":"Qiang He","affiliation":["School of Software and Electrical Engineering, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"He","id":"38247595900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4513-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4514-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-8411"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"9546491","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Low Latency Edge Intelligence based on Multi-exit DNNs in the Wild","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546491","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Heuristic algorithms","Computational modeling","Prototypes","Dispatching","Task analysis","Low latency communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge intelligence","Multi-exit setting","Computation offloading","DNN inference"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have witnessed a booming of artificial intelligence Internet of Things applications with stringent demands across high accuracy and low latency. A widely adopted solution is to process such computation-intensive DNNs inference tasks with edge computing. Nevertheless, existing edge-based DNN processing methods still cannot achieve acceptable performance due to the intensive transmission data and unnecessary computation. To address the above limitations, we take the advantage of Multi-exit DNNs (ME-DNNs) that allows the tasks to exit early at different depths of the DNN during inference, based on the input complexity. However, naively deploying ME-DNNs in edge still fails to deliver fast and consistent inference in the wild environment. Specifically, 1) at the model-level, unsuitable exit settings will increase additional computational overhead and will lead to excessive queuing delay; 2) at the computation-level, it is hard to sustain high performance consistently in the dynamic edge computing environment. In this paper, we present a Low Latency Edge Intelligence Scheme based on Multi-Exit DNNs (LEIME) to tackle the aforementioned problem. At the model-level, we propose an exit setting algorithm to automatically build optimal ME-DNNs with lower time complexity; At the computation-level, we present a distributed offloading mechanism to fine-tune the task dispatching at runtime to sustain high performance in the dynamic environment, which has the property of close-to-optimal performance guarantee. Finally, we implement a prototype system and extensively evaluate it through testbed and large-scale simulation experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that LEIME significantly improves applications' performance, achieving 1.1\u201318.7 \u00d7 speedup in different situations.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00075","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9546301/9546401/09546491.pdf","startPage":"729","endPage":"739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9546401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Low Latency Edge Intelligence based on Multi-exit DNNs in the Wild","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9546491/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"July 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018AAA0100500"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872079,61902065,61632008,61702096,61702097,61972085,61906040"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20170689,BK20190345,BK20190335"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Low Latency Edge Intelligence based on Multi-exit DNNs in the Wild","confLoc":"DC, USA","sourcePdf":"451300a729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148296S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546301","isNumber":"9546401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546301","xplore-issue":"9546401","articleId":"9546491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9546493,"authors":[{"name":"Weibin Ma","affiliation":["University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA"],"firstName":"Weibin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086961020"},{"name":"Lena Mashayekhy","affiliation":["University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA"],"firstName":"Lena","lastName":"Mashayekhy","id":"38230590700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4513-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4514-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-8411"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"9546493","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Costs","Visual analytics","Stochastic processes","Clustering algorithms","Object detection","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge computing","mobility","video offloading"]}],"abstract":"By 2022, videos will account for 82% of global Internet traffic.

The video offloading quality and other offloading decisions are adaptively made to jointly optimize the video quality and migration cost under the consideration of uncertain device mobility.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Poster: Adaptive Video Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00121","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9546301/9546401/09546493.pdf","startPage":"1130","endPage":"1131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9546401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Poster: Adaptive Video Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9546493/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Poster: Adaptive Video Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing","confLoc":"DC, USA","sourcePdf":"451300b130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030854S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546301","isNumber":"9546401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546301","xplore-issue":"9546401","articleId":"9546493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9546518,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Hope","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Hope","id":"37088983343"},{"name":"Eiko Yoneki","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Eiko","lastName":"Yoneki","id":"37424231700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4513-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4514-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-8411"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"9546518","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546518","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge engineering","Network topology","Conferences","Reinforcement learning","Computer architecture","Multilayer perceptrons","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning (artificial intelligence)","graph theory","multilayer perceptrons","neural nets","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph neural networks","multilayer perceptron architectures","policy architectures","data-driven routing","intradomain traffic engineering","particular subproblem","historic traffic flows","deep reinforcement learning","GNN-based data-driven routing","link congestion","trained agent generalisation","network topologies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reinforcement learning","Graph neural networks","Data-driven networks"]}],"abstract":"We explore the feasibility of combining Graph Neural Network-based policy architectures with Deep Reinforcement Learning as an approach to problems in systems.

As a case study, we take the idea of data-driven routing in intradomain traffic engineering, whereby the routing of data in a network can be managed taking into account the data itself. The particular subproblem which we examine is minimising link congestion in networks using knowledge of historic traffic flows. We show through experiments that an approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) performs at least as well as previous work using Multilayer Perceptron architectures. GNNs have the added benefit that they allow for the generalisation of trained agents to different network topologies with no extra work. Furthermore, we believe that this technique is applicable to a far wider selection of problems in systems research.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9546401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00056","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9546301/9546401/09546518.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"527","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GDDR: GNN-based Data-Driven Routing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"GDDR: GNN-based Data-Driven Routing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9546518/","publicationDate":"July 2021","accessionNumber":"21202415","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546518/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012338","fundingName":"Alan Turing Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GDDR: GNN-based Data-Driven Routing","confLoc":"DC, USA","sourcePdf":"451300a517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083178S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546301","isNumber":"9546401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546301","xplore-issue":"9546401","articleId":"9546518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9546520,"authors":[{"name":"Zichuan Xu","affiliation":["School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zichuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"38252630100"},{"name":"Dongqi Liu","affiliation":["School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Dongqi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088985778"},{"name":"Weifa Liang","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Weifa","lastName":"Liang","id":"37279572200"},{"name":"Wenzheng Xu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Wenzheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088349690"},{"name":"Haipeng Dai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Haipeng","lastName":"Dai","id":"37071771400"},{"name":"Qiufen Xia","affiliation":["International School of Information Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Qiufen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37085506849"},{"name":"Pan Zhou","affiliation":["The Hubei Engineering Research Center on Big Data Security, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37398057500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4513-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4514-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-8411"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"9546520","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Conferences","Education","Entertainment industry","Medical services","Immersive experience","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile edge computing","augmented reality","reward maximization","online learning","Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546520","abstract":"Augmented Reality (AR) has various practical applications in healthcare, education, and entertainment.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of reward maximization for AR applications with uncertain demands in an MEC network, such that the reward of provisioning services for AR applications is maximized and the responsiveness of AR applications is enhanced, subject to both network resource capacity. We devise an exact solution for the problem if the problem size is small, otherwise we develop an efficient approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the problem. We also devise an online learning algorithm with a bounded regret for the dynamic reward maximization problem without the knowledge of the future arrivals of AR requests, by adopting the technique of Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB). We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through simulations. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing studies by 17 % higher reward.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00105","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9546301/9546401/09546520.pdf","startPage":"1064","endPage":"1074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9546401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Learning Algorithms for Offloading Augmented Reality Requests with Uncertain Demands in MECs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Online Learning Algorithms for Offloading Augmented Reality Requests with Uncertain Demands in MECs","htmlLink":"/document/9546520/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"July 2021","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61802048,61802047"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61972448"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Learning Algorithms for Offloading Augmented Reality Requests with Uncertain Demands in MECs","confLoc":"DC, USA","sourcePdf":"451300b064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097514S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546301","isNumber":"9546401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546301","xplore-issue":"9546401","articleId":"9546520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9546527,"authors":[{"name":"Huizi Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Huizi","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37088983450"},{"name":"Qingyang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qingyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086038780"},{"name":"Qingqi Pei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qingqi","lastName":"Pei","id":"37294380000"},{"name":"Weisong Shi","affiliation":["Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Weisong","lastName":"Shi","id":"37278937600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4513-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4514-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-8411"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"9546527","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546527","abstract":"Edge computing is a promising paradigm that pushes computing, storage, and energy to the networks' edge. It utilizes the data nearby the users to provide real-time, energy-efficient, and reliable services. Neural network inference in edge computing is a powerful tool for various applications. However, edge server will collect more personal sensitive information of users inevitably. It is the most basic requirement for users to ensure their security and privacy while obtaining accurate inference results. Homomorphic encryption (HE) technology is confidential computing that directly performs mathematical computing on encrypted data. But it only can carry out limited addition and multiplication operation with very low efficiency. Intel software guard extension (SGX) can provide a trusted isolation space in the CPU to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of code and data executed. But several defects are hard to overcome due to hardware design limitations when applying SGX in inference services. This paper proposes a hybrid framework utilizing SGX to accelerate the HE-based convolutional neural network (CNN) inference, eliminating the approximation operations in HE to improve inference accuracy in theory. Besides, SGX is also taken as a built-in trusted third party to distribute keys, thereby improving our framework's scalability and flexibility. We have quantified the various CNN operations in the respective cases of HE and SGX to provide the foresight practice. Taking the connected and autonomous vehicles as a case study in edge computing, we implemented this hybrid framework in CNN to verify its feasibility and advantage.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00077","startPage":"751","endPage":"761","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9546301/9546401/09546527.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9546401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Neural Network Inference Framework via Homomorphic Encryption and SGX","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Scalability","Neural networks","Tools","Throughput","Hardware","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","distributed processing","inference mechanisms","network servers","neural nets","software architecture","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-preserving neural network inference framework","homomorphic encryption","SGX","edge computing","edge server","personal sensitive information","accurate inference results","confidential computing","mathematical computing","encrypted data","inference services","inference accuracy","real-time services","energy-efficient services","reliable services","Intel software guard extension","trusted isolation space","CPU","hardware design limitations","HE-based convolutional neural network inference","approximation operations","built-in trusted third party","framework scalability","framework flexibility","autonomous vehicles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge computing","neural network inference","privacy-preserving","Intel SGX","homomorphic encryption"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Neural Network Inference Framework via Homomorphic Encryption and SGX","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9546527/","publicationDate":"July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2021","accessionNumber":"21202426","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YF-B1807500"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"XJS210107,XJS210105,XJS211513,XJS201502"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Preserving Neural Network Inference Framework via Homomorphic Encryption and SGX","confLoc":"DC, USA","sourcePdf":"451300a751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115115S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546301","isNumber":"9546401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546301","xplore-issue":"9546401","articleId":"9546527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9546539,"authors":[{"name":"Roxana Alexandru","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9546539/alexa-3113789-small.gif","p":["Roxana Alexandru (Student Member, IEEE) graduated from Imperial College London, U.K. with the master's degree (first class) in 2016.

We assume a mobile sensor samples the field, uniformly along a piecewise linear trajectory, which is unknown. The problem we address is the estimation of the amplitudes and locations of the diffusion sources, as well as of the trajectory of the sensor. We first propose a method for diffusion source localisation and trajectory mapping (D-SLAM) in 2D, where we assume the activation times of the sources are known and the evolution of the diffusion field over time is negligible. The reconstruction method we propose maps the measurements obtained using the mobile sensor to a sequence of generalised field samples. From these generalised samples, we can then retrieve the locations of the sources as well as the trajectory of the sensor (up to a 2D orthogonal geometric transformation). We then relax these assumptions and show that we can perform D-SLAM also in the case of unknown activation times, from samples of a time-varying field, as well as in 3D spaces. Finally, simulation results on both synthetic and real data further validate the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3113789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09546539.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3113789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","startPage":"5539","endPage":"5554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffusion SLAM: Localizing Diffusion Sources From Samples Taken by Location-Unaware Mobile Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Diffusion SLAM: Localizing Diffusion Sources From Samples Taken by Location-Unaware Mobile Sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9546539/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffusion SLAM: Localizing Diffusion Sources From Samples Taken by Location-Unaware Mobile Sensors","sourcePdf":"tsp-alexandru-3113789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114353S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9546539","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":9546620,"authors":[{"name":"Litao Ma","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Physics, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488902/9644929/9546620/ma-3114426-small.gif","p":["Litao Ma received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2020.

To get rid of structuring the pseudo images as the preprocessing, we propose a new fusion module, PI-fusion module. It can directly fuse points with pixels or grids which refer to the cells in the feature maps extracted from RGB images. Specifically, every point is aligned with a certain pixel/grid based on the pre-calibrated camera-LiDAR external parameters. The features aggregated from the points and pixels/grids are transferred to each other, which achieves the bidirectional fusion of the information. Then, we construct the PI-Net's fusion backbone by plugging the PI-fusion modules between a certain 2D CNN and a point-based network to fuse the features at every scale. The detection and the segmentation head networks further utilize the fused information to complete various tasks. The PI-Net unifies the point-cloud-to-image and image-to-point-cloud fusion into one network and achieves state-of-the-art results on the various tasks, such as the road detection, 3D object detection, and point cloud segmentation tasks on the KITTI benchmark.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"21101602","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9546639/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"PI-Net: An End-to-End Deep Neural Network for Bidirectionally and Directly Fusing Point Clouds With Images","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61973272"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100017691","fundingName":"Guangxi Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"AB20325004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PI-Net: An End-to-End Deep Neural Network for Bidirectionally and Directly Fusing Point Clouds With Images","sourcePdf":"lra-chen-3114429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152484S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"9475905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","xplore-issue":"9475905","articleId":"9546639","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9546643,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuang Miao","affiliation":["Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhuang","lastName":"Miao","orcid":"0000-0003-2289-4589","id":"37545213100"},{"name":"Xun Zhao","affiliation":["Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0002-1767-6520","id":"37087100591"},{"name":"Jiabao Wang","affiliation":["Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jiabao","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-3706-9912","id":"37599834700"},{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1682-0284","id":"37310402700"},{"name":"Hang Li","affiliation":["Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085710964"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9546643","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Transformers","Automobiles","Task analysis","Dogs","Training","Loss measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attention","fine-grained classification","transformer"]}],"abstract":"Transformer-based architecture network has shown excellent performance in the coarse-grained image classification. However, it remains a challenge for the fine-grained image classification task, which needs more significant regional information. As one of the attention mechanisms, transformer pays attention to the most significant region while neglecting other sub-significant regions. To use more regional information, in this letter, we propose a complemental attention multi-feature fusion network (CAMF), which extracts multiple attention features to obtain more effective features. In CAMF, we propose two novel modules: (i) a complemental attention module (CAM) that extracts the most salient attention feature and the complemental attention feature. (ii) a multi-feature fusion module (MFM) that uses different branches to extract multiple regional discriminative features. Furthermore, a new feature similarity loss is proposed to measure the diversity of inter-class features. Experiments were conducted on four public fine-grained classification datasets. Our CAMF achieves 91.2%, 92.8%, 93.3%, 95.3% on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, FGVC-Aircraft, and Stanford Cars. The ablation study verified that CAM and MFM can focus on more local discriminative regions and improve fine-grained classification performance.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3114622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09546643.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3114622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","startPage":"1983","endPage":"1987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complemental Attention Multi-Feature Fusion Network for Fine-Grained Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Complemental Attention Multi-Feature Fusion Network for Fine-Grained Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9546643/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20200581"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61806220"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2020M683754 and 2021T140799"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complemental Attention Multi-Feature Fusion Network for Fine-Grained Classification","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-3114622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083176S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9546643","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":9546648,"authors":[{"name":"Tianjiao Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6745852/9318600/9546648/zeng-3114542-small.gif","p":["Tianjiao Zeng received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Rutgers University.

Most existing reconstruction algorithms are implemented assuming that the forward imaging process is a convolution operation, with a point spread function based on the system model. In reality, there is model mismatch, leading to inferior image reconstruction results. In this paper, we investigate the impact of model mismatch in mask-based lensless imaging and for the first time, illustrate the accumulated artifacts and information loss due to mismatch error in the state-of-the-art approaches, which perform model-based reconstruction and learning-based enhancement in separate stages. To overcome this, we develop a novel physics-informed deep learning architecture that aims at addressing such mismatch error. The proposed hybrid reconstruction network consists of both unrolled model-based optimization to apply system physics and deep learning layers for model correction. Besides a cascaded enhancement network, we introduce a data-driven branch in parallel, making use of both input measurement and all intermediate outputs from the model-based layers to correct the bias and compensate for the information loss due to model mismatch. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model mismatch compensation network, referred to as MMCN, is demonstrated on real lensless images. Experimental results show noticeably better performance for MMCN compared with the alternative methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9546648/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21176441","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Reconstruction With Deep Learning to Handle Model Mismatch in Lensless Imaging","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"17201818, 17200019 and 17201620"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004835","fundingName":"University of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"104005864"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Reconstruction With Deep Learning to Handle Model Mismatch in Lensless Imaging","sourcePdf":"tci-zeng-3114542-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118145S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"9318600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","xplore-issue":"9318600","articleId":"9546648","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9546651,"authors":[{"name":"Ken Mishina","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Ken Mishina (Member, IEEE) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical, electronic, and information engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 2005, 2007, and 2012, respectively.

In recent years, several studies on artificial neural network (ANN)-based equalization and demodulation schemes for eigenvalue-modulated signal have been conducted to enhance the receiver sensitivity. However, in the case of a presence of a carrier frequency offset (CFO) at receiver, the effects of the CFO on ANN receiver of eigenvalue-modulated signal is yet to be reported. In this study, we numerically and experimentally investigated the generalization performances of eigenvalue domain ANN-based demodulator on CFO. Furthermore, we propose to combine an ANN-based demodulator with a CFO compensation method based on IST and a relation between frequency and eigenvalue shifts.

The angular parameters of mixed sources can be classified and estimated by performing DFT on the anti-diagonal elements of covariance matrix and the received signal. Moreover, the estimated angular parameters and covariance are used to construct a sparse reconstruction problem related with range parameters, which can be solved by OMP algorithm. Furthermore, an iteration method is also proposed to compensate the bias of DFT.

We make explicit the resulting tight lower bound on the image set size of differentially \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\delta $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-uniform functions (which is the only currently known non-trivial lower bound on the image set size of such functions). We also significantly improve an upper bound on the nonlinearity of vectorial functions obtained in the same reference and involving their image set size. We study when the resulting bound is sharper than the covering radius bound. We obtain as a by-product a lower bound on the Hamming distance between differentially \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\delta $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-uniform functions and affine functions, which we improve significantly with a second bound. This leads us to study what can be the maximum Hamming distance between vectorial functions and affine functions. We provide an upper bound which is slightly sharper than a bound by Liu, Mesnager and Chen when \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m &lt; n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n, and a second upper bound, which is much stronger in the case (happening in practice) where \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n is near \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n; we study the tightness of this latter bound; this leads to an interesting question on APN functions, which we address (negatively). We finally derive an upper bound on the nonlinearity of vectorial functions by means of their Hamming distance to affine functions and make more precise the bound on the differential uniformity which was the starting point of the paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounds on the Nonlinearity of Differentially Uniform Functions by Means of Their Image Set Size, and on Their Distance to Affine Functions","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3114958","endPage":"8334","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9622121/09546753.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"8325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3114958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546753","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ciphers","Hamming distance","Cryptography","Upper bound","Resistance","Transforms","Hamming weight"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vectorial function","cryptography","substitution box (S-box)","nonlinearity","differential uniformity","Hamming distance to affine functions","error correcting code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bounds on the Nonlinearity of Differentially Uniform Functions by Means of Their Image Set Size, and on Their Distance to Affine Functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"67","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9546753/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100016190","fundingName":"Trond Mohn stiftelse"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounds on the Nonlinearity of Differentially Uniform Functions by Means of Their Image Set Size, and on Their Distance to Affine Functions","sourcePdf":"tit-carlet-3114958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085236S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9622121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9622121","articleId":"9546753","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":9546755,"authors":[{"name":"Affan Affan","affiliation":["University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Affan","lastName":"Affan","orcid":"0000-0002-0666-7696"},{"name":"Shahid Mumtaz","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es Campus Universit\u00e1rio de Santiago, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Shahid","lastName":"Mumtaz","orcid":"0000-0001-6364-6149"},{"name":"Hafiz M.

However, the performance of AirComp is bottlenecked by the worst channel condition among all links between the IoT devices and the access point. In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted AirComp system is proposed to boost the received signal power and thus mitigate the performance bottleneck by reconfiguring the propagation channels. With an objective to minimize the AirComp distortion, we propose a joint design of AirComp transceivers and RIS phase-shifts, which however turns out to be a highly intractable non-convex programming problem. To this end, we develop a novel alternating minimization framework in conjunction with the successive convex approximation technique, which is proved to converge monotonically. To reduce the computational complexity, we transform the subproblem in each alternation as a smooth convex-concave saddle point problem, which is then tackled by proposing a Mirror-Prox method that only involves a sequence of closed-form updates. Simulations show that the computation time of the proposed algorithm can be two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving a similar distortion performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114791","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09546764.pdf","startPage":"8612","endPage":"8626","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Over-the-Air Computation via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Over-the-Air Computation via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface","volume":"69","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9546764/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"62001294"},{"fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation under the RISK project (Risk Aware Data-Driven Demand Response)","grantNumber":"200021175627"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Over-the-Air Computation via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhou-3114791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085282S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9546764","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9546767,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Abin","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Hamidreza Abin is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology.

While numerical methods can be used to solve these equations, a change in the input signals or the parameters of the medium requires one to redo the simulations. This makes it difficult to design modulation schemes and practically impossible to prove the optimality of a given transmission strategy. In this paper, we provide an analytical technique for modeling the non-linearity of chemical reaction equations based on the perturbation method. The perturbation method expresses the solution in terms of an infinite power series. An approximate solution can be found by keeping the leading terms of the power series. The approximate solution is shown to track the true solution if either the simulation time interval or the reaction rate is sufficiently small. Approximate solutions for long time intervals are also discussed. An illustrative example is given. For this example, it is shown that when the reaction rate (or the total time interval) is low, instead of using a continuous release waveform, it is optimal for the transmitters to release molecules at two time instances.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114831","startPage":"8042","endPage":"8054","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09546767.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Model for Molecular Communication Over a Non-Linear Reaction-Diffusion Medium","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546767/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Model for Molecular Communication Over a Non-Linear Reaction-Diffusion Medium","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9546767/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"INSF grant on \u201cNanonetwork Communications.\u201d"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Model for Molecular Communication Over a Non-Linear Reaction-Diffusion Medium","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gohari-3114831-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067198S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9546767","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9546773,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Li","affiliation":["Mogo Auto Intelligence and Telematics Information Technology Company Ltd., Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9546773/nli-3114691-small.gif","p":["Ning Li was born in Neimeng, China.

Accurate and real-time traffic flow prediction is the key and difficult part of the traffic. The complex spatial topological structure and dynamic traffic flow information in urban roads constitute a changeable spatial correlation, and the daily traffic flow cycle and weekly traffic flow cycle constitute a complex time correlation. For the current mainstream model, there are two main limitations: 1. Most of the existing models only focus on time correlation and ignore spatial correlation. 2. Even if the spatial correlation is concerned, the topological relationship between spaces is not fully considered. This paper proposes a new traffic-flow prediction model, which named Principal Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (PST-GCN) model, which uses a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Graph Convolution Network (GCN), and Long Short-Term Memory model (LSTM). Specifically, PCA is used to reduce the dimension of data, GCN is used to learn the network topology of urban roads, LSTM is used to capture the time correlation of traffic flow. By comparing the results of different models, the proposed model is better than the current mainstream models.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114691","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09546773.pdf","startPage":"135423","endPage":"135431","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic Message Channel Prediction Based on Graph Convolutional Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Message Channel Prediction Based on Graph Convolutional Network","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21126786","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9546773/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Traffic Message Channel Prediction Based on Graph Convolutional Network","sourcePdf":"access-li-3114691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.214789S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9546773","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9546779,"authors":[{"name":"Edgar Beck","affiliation":["University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9546779/beck-3114682-small.gif","p":["Edgar Beck (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (with honors) in electrical engineering from the University of Bremen, Germany, in 2014 and 2017, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering with the Department of Communications Engineering (ANT).

The main motivation behind is that the complexity of Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) detection grows exponentially with system dimensions. Instead of using DNNs, essentially being a black-box, we take a slightly different approach and introduce a probabilistic Continuous relaxation of disCrete variables to MAP detection. Enabling close approximation and continuous optimization, we derive an iterative detection algorithm: Concrete MAP Detection (CMD). Furthermore, extending CMD by the idea of deep unfolding into CMDNet, we allow for (online) optimization of a small number of parameters to different working points while limiting complexity. In contrast to recent DNN-based approaches, we select the optimization criterion and output of CMDNet based on information theory and are thus able to learn approximate probabilities of the individual optimal detector. This is crucial for soft decoding in today\u2019s communication systems. Numerical simulation results in MIMO systems reveal CMDNet to feature a promising accuracy complexity trade-off compared to State of the Art. Notably, we demonstrate CMDNet\u2019s soft outputs to be reliable for decoders.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114682","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09546779.pdf","startPage":"8214","endPage":"8227","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMDNet: Learning a Probabilistic Relaxation of Discrete Variables for Soft Detection With Low Complexity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"CMDNet: Learning a Probabilistic Relaxation of Discrete Variables for Soft Detection With Low Complexity","volume":"69","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9546779/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)","grantNumber":"16KIS1028 (MOMENTUM)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"CMDNet: Learning a Probabilistic Relaxation of Discrete Variables for Soft Detection With Low Complexity","sourcePdf":"tcomm-beck-3114682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070198S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9546779","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9546780,"authors":[{"name":"Jingxuan Huang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9546780/huang-3114764-small.gif","p":["Jingxuan Huang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, China, in 2016 and 2021, respectively.

However, low-complexity receivers generally have limited buffer size to store coded symbols that have not been fully decoded yet, as well as limited power budget for feedback transmissions. In this paper, we propose improved transmission schemes for online fountain codes to reduce the buffer occupancy and feedback transmissions. Firstly, we analyze the relationship between buffer occupancy and overhead as well as the relationship between recovery rate and overhead for online fountain codes. Motivated by the analysis, we propose the weighted online fountain codes (WOFC) which can adapt to various buffer sizes by adjusting the weight to control the probability that a coded symbol can be fully processed immediately, and analyze its performance. Then we further propose weighted online fountain codes with low feedback (WOFC-LF), which utilize the proposed analysis to estimate the recovery rate, and reduce feedback transmissions. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the analysis for both OFC and WOFC, and demonstrate the superior performance of WOFC-LF with limited buffer size and feedback transmissions.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114764","startPage":"7960","endPage":"7973","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09546780.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Online Fountain Codes With Limited Buffer Size and Feedback Transmissions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Decoding","Receivers","Encoding","Buffer storage","Complexity theory","Simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Online fountain codes","intermediate performance","erasure channel","feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Online Fountain Codes With Limited Buffer Size and Feedback Transmissions","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9546780/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"No.61871032"},{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1807203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"Ericsson company, and by China Scholarship Council (CSC)"},{"fundingName":"EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Project entitled \u201cHigh-reliability Low-latency Communications with network coding\u201d, and ERA-NET Smart Energy Systems SG+ 2017 Program, \u201cSMART-MLA\u201d with Project number 89029 (and SWEA number 42811-2), and Swedish Strategic Research Foundation project \u201cHigh-reliable Low-latency Industrial Wireless Communications\u201d"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP190101363"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"ARC Linkage Project","grantNumber":"LP170101196"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Online Fountain Codes With Limited Buffer Size and Feedback Transmissions","sourcePdf":"tcomm-fei-3114764-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09315S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9546780","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9546788,"authors":[{"name":"Mingxiong Zhao","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Cyberspace, National Pilot School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Mingxiong","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0001-9499-5456"},{"name":"Huiqi Bao","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Cyberspace, National Pilot School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Huiqi","lastName":"Bao"},{"name":"Li Yin","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Cyberspace, National Pilot School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Yin"},{"name":"Jianping Yao","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Yao","orcid":"0000-0003-2475-1450"},{"name":"Tony Q.

Specifically, the users adopt the partial offloading strategy by partitioning the computation task into several parts. One is executed locally and the others are securely offloaded to multiple MEC servers integrated into the base stations by leveraging the physical layer security to combat the eavesdropping. We jointly optimize power allocation, task partition, subcarrier allocation, and computation resource to maximize the secrecy offloading rate of the users, subject to communication and computation resource constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes outperform the benchmark schemes substantially and emphasize the necessity of conducting computation offloading over multiple MEC servers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Offloading Rate Maximization for Multi-Access Mobile Edge Computing Networks","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3114772","endPage":"3804","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09546788.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","startPage":"3800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3114772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546788","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Task analysis","Security","Resource management","Energy consumption","Radio spectrum management","Quality of service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-access mobile edge computing (MEC)","physical layer security","secrecy offloading rate maximization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Offloading Rate Maximization for Multi-Access Mobile Edge Computing Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9546788/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801418"},{"fundingName":"Open Foundation of Key Laboratory in Software Engineering of Yunnan Province","grantNumber":"2020SE316"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100021171","fundingName":"Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2021A1515011645 and 2021A1515110295"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"202102020332"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Offloading Rate Maximization for Multi-Access Mobile Edge Computing Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-yao-3114772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057928S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9546788","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9546789,"authors":[{"name":"Ba Cao Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Basic Techniques, Telecommunications University, Nha Trang, Vietnam"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9546789/bnguy-3114713-small.gif","p":["Ba Cao Nguyen received the B.S. degree from Telecommunication University, Khanh Hoa, Vietnam, in 2006, the M.S. degree from the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (VNPT), Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from Le Quy Don Technical University, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2020.

Specifically, cooperative communications are applied at two FD terminals in a RISs-assisted bidirectional full-duplex (RIS-FD) system. In this context, we successfully derive the mathematical expressions of the outage probability (OP) and the ergodic capacity (EC) of the RIS-FD system with a direct link between two terminals and multiple reflecting paths created by RISs over the Rayleigh fading channel. Numerical results show that the performance of the considered RIS-FD system depends significantly on the total number of reflecting elements in the RISs. Particularly, when the total number of reflecting elements is small, the OP and EC saturate at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, when the total number of reflecting elements is large enough, OP decreases greatly while EC enhances significantly. In addition, the effect of residual self-interference (SI) caused by FD transmission on OP and EC is remarkable, even the residual SI level is very small. On the other hand, the influence of other system parameters such as the number of RISs (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$N$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n) and the number of reflecting elements (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$L$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n) are also investigated to fully consider the performance of the RIS-FD system. An important observation is that when current techniques cannot completely eliminate SI in FD transmission, the use of multiple RISs with larger \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$L$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n can indirectly reduce the impact of SI and significantly improve the performance of the proposed RIS-FD system.

We consider an IoT status update system with users, energy harvesting sensors, and a cache-enabled edge node. The users receive time-sensitive information about physical quantities, each measured by a sensor. Users demand for the information from the edge node whose cache stores the most recently received measurements from each sensor. To serve a request, the edge node either commands the sensor to send an update or retrieves the aged measurement from the cache. We aim at finding the best actions of the edge node to minimize the average AoI of the served measurements at the users, termed on-demand AoI. We model this problem as a Markov decision process and develop reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms: model-based value iteration and model-free Q-learning. We also propose a Q-learning method for the realistic case where the edge node is informed about the sensors\u2019 battery levels only via the status updates. The case under transmission limitations is also addressed. Furthermore, properties of an optimal policy are characterized. Simulation results show that an optimal policy is a threshold-based policy and that the proposed RL methods significantly reduce the average cost compared to several baselines.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114681","startPage":"8335","endPage":"8351","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09546792.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AoI Minimization in Status Update Control With Energy Harvesting Sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Batteries","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor systems","Monitoring","Minimization","Energy harvesting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things (IoT)","age of information (AoI)","energy harvesting","reinforcement learning (RL)","value iteration algorithm (VIA)","dynamic programming","Q-learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546792/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"AoI Minimization in Status Update Control With Energy Harvesting Sensors","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9546792/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100018948","fundingName":"Infotech Oulu, the Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"323698"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland 6Genesis Flagship","grantNumber":"318927"},{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Grant Agreement","grantNumber":"793402 (COMPRESS NETS)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"319485"},{"fundingName":"HPY Research Foundation and Riitta ja Jorma J.

In RCPSPs, it is very common to consider homogeneous activities, which means all activities require all types of resources. In practice, the activities are often singular because they usually require one single resource to execute an activity. The existing algorithms may be used for solving this variant of RCPSPs with a simple modification. However, they are computationally expensive due to unnecessary resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a customised evolutionary algorithm integrated with three heuristics for the singular activities. The first heuristic is based on the earliest start time with an aim to rectify an infeasible schedule. The second heuristic is based on neighbourhood swapping which is used to find the best possible alternatives. The third heuristic is used to further enhance the quality of the schedule. The performance of the proposed framework has been tested by solving a wide range of benchmark problems and the obtained results revealed that the proposed approach outperformed the existing algorithms. In addition, statistical and parametric testing show the value and characteristics of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546802/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9546802/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm for Singular Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP210102939"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Genetic Algorithm for Singular Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problems","sourcePdf":"access-mahmud-3114702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094866S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9546802","onlineDate":"22 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9546814,"authors":[{"name":"Jinghui Lyu","affiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jinghui","lastName":"Lyu","id":"37088977382"},{"name":"Yude Bai","affiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yude","lastName":"Bai","id":"37087106201"},{"name":"Zhenchang Xing","affiliation":["Research School of Computer Science, Australian National University, Data61 CSIRO, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhenchang","lastName":"Xing","id":"37591593000"},{"name":"Xiaohong Li","affiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohong","lastName":"Li","id":"37088962497"},{"name":"Weimin Ge","affiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Weimin","lastName":"Ge","id":"37087105017"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4163-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4164-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9546814","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Neural networks","Predictive models","Software","Robustness","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vulnerability Exploitability Prediction","Vulnerability description","Deep Learning","Mining Software Repositories"]}],"abstract":"The continuous discovery of software vulnerabilities have brought great challenges to the cyber security, which will lead to severe systematical or individual losses after being exploited. But the harshly increasing of software vulnerabilities overwhelms the time consuming vulnerability analysis. Security experts must pay more attention to the ones which have the highest priority to be repaired. In general, both severity and exploitability determine the severity of a software vulnerability. Compared with the severity evaluated by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS score), the exploitability is still lack of a well-accepted standard. Furthermore, based on the perspective of attack and defense, we found that the exploitability of vulnerabilities is more attractive to hackers so that system or individual is severely affected by the exploitability rather than the severity. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based approach to predict the exploitability of the vulnerability by using the correlated textual description and characteristics. Specifically, our approach takes character-level Convolutional Neural Network (charCNN) to fetch more fine-grained character-level features from the vulnerability description instead of the word-level features considered by the previous literatures. And we highlight the importance of vulnerability characteristics such as Confidentiality Impact, Integrity Impact, Attack Vector etc. during the determination of vulnerability exploitability. Extensive experiments are set to prove the effectiveness of the given charCNN approach through the comparison on both different levels of features and different neural network models. Our approach achieves the best F1 values 93.1% (at least 2.2% more than the baselines). And we also investigate the efficiency of charCNN trained by historical vulnerability when predicting the exploitability of the newly published vulnerabilities. Finally, we further explore the robustness of the proposed model by changing the scale of training sets. For the prediction of vulnerability exploitability, we recommend to adopt 40.0% to 50.0% vulnerabilities to train a robust charCNN model.","publicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering (TASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering (TASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9546803/9546729/09546814.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Character-Level Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting Exploitability of Vulnerability","doi":"10.1109/TASE52547.2021.00014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9546729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE52547.2021.00014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Character-Level Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting Exploitability of Vulnerability","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9546814/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Character-Level Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting Exploitability of Vulnerability","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"416300a119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078971S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546803","isNumber":"9546729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546803","xplore-issue":"9546729","articleId":"9546814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9546824,"authors":[{"name":"Qunhao Sha","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Qunhao","lastName":"Sha"},{"name":"Qizhe Yang","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Qizhe","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Guoqiang Li","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Guoqiang","lastName":"Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4163-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4164-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9546824","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546824","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scalability","Instruction sets","Software algorithms","Model checking","Open data","Software engineering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Knowledge graph","liveness","parallel implementation"]}],"abstract":"Knowledge graphs are used extensively in various fields. Labor-intensive and time-consuming error detection for large-scale knowledge graphs significantly increases the need for efficient model checking algorithms in large-scale graphs. Since conventional algorithms are inefficient on such graphs, we propose a new liveness algorithm of knowledge graphs, under a specific given set of labels. By trimming and marking the graphs alternately, a weakly connected components algorithm is then designed to separate graphs into several disjoint sets and a bidirectional forward-backward algorithm computes strongly connected components in each set in parallel. We have implemented our algorithm on a real medical knowledge graph and several open data sets. The evaluation shows that our algorithm achieves up to 11.2x speedup over conventional algorithm with 16 threads.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE52547.2021.00016","doi":"10.1109/TASE52547.2021.00016","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering (TASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9546803/9546729/09546824.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"110","publicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering (TASE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9546729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel Implementation of Liveness on Knowledge Graphs under Label Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Parallel Implementation of Liveness on Knowledge Graphs under Label Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9546824/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel Implementation of Liveness on Knowledge Graphs under Label Constraints","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"416300a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075719S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546803","isNumber":"9546729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546803","xplore-issue":"9546729","articleId":"9546824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":9546834,"authors":[{"name":"Jiro Hirokawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9171629/9562119/9546834/hirok-3106871-small.gif","p":["Jiro Hirokawa (Fellow, IEEE) was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1965.

It also describes the associated numerical design method, supported by several design examples. The concept is further validated with a full-wave model of a generic 5 \u00d7 5 switching matrix designed at 76 GHz. The proposed matrices are obtained by cascading units consisting of a two-way coupler and a phase shifter in a parallel configuration, providing theoretically lossless operation as a direct consequence of the orthogonal BFN topology and equalized path lengths, expected to benefit the frequency bandwidth. The design method is general, also including the configurations equivalent to Butler matrices when the number of beams is a power of two. The obtained planar matrix designs combine some benefits of the well-known Butler and Nolen matrices, namely the parallel topology and the arbitrary number of beams. The minimum number of cascaded units required by the proposed topology, also corresponding to the number of layers, is found to be \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n, where \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n is the number of beams, which is less than the number of cascaded units for the corresponding \u201cparallel\u201d Nolen matrix, for \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n larger than three, thus providing a reduction in the number of layers of up to 38% for an 8-beam matrix. This reduction is close to the theoretical upper boundary of 50%, reached for large values of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n. This significant reduction is expected to have a positive impact on RF performance, and in particular insertion losses, as well as amplitude and phase dispersion over the operating band. Interestingly, the proposed switching matrix configuration reduces to a standard Butler matrix when the number of beams is equal to 4, and demonstrates a reduction in the number of layers of 20% over the corresponding planar Butler matrix for a design with 8 beams. The proposed matrix configuration is a promising solution for the design of low-cost single-layer beam-switching matrices.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Microwaves","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Microwaves","pdfPath":"/iel7/9171629/9562119/09546834.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JMW.2021.3106871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMW.2021.3106871","startPage":"975","endPage":"988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized One-Dimensional Parallel Switching Matrices With an Arbitrary Number of Beams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Fall  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546834/","displayDocTitle":"Generalized One-Dimensional Parallel Switching Matrices With an Arbitrary Number of Beams","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9546834/","volume":"1","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"Fall 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Generalized One-Dimensional Parallel Switching Matrices With an Arbitrary Number of Beams","sourcePdf":"jmw-hirokawa-3106871-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150639S","chronDate":"Fall  2021","xplore-pub-id":"9171629","isNumber":"9562119","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9171629","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9562119","articleId":"9546834","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":9546835,"authors":[{"name":"Madhan Thirumoorthi","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Madhan","lastName":"Thirumoorthi","orcid":"0000-0002-6414-5714"},{"name":"Marko Jovanovic","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Jovanovic"},{"name":"Mitra Mirhassani","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Mitra","lastName":"Mirhassani","orcid":"0000-0001-8512-6427"},{"name":"Mohammed Khalid","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Khalid","orcid":"0000-0003-3903-8789"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"9546835","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Physical unclonable function","Logic gates","Security","Hardware","Support vector machines","Picture archiving and communication systems","Inverters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaos function","physical unclonable functions (PUF)","probably approximately correct (PAC)"]}],"abstract":"A physical unclonable function (PUF) is a promising lightweight circuit that provides security and authentication capability for electronic devices with low computational resources.

But considering the dynamic UEs, nonuniform distribution of task requests and the limitation of the dynamic of the fixed deployment of the edge severs, we investigate a Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)-assisted edge computing system in this paper, where each UAV is equipped with server to assist local edge servers. Utilizing the mobility of UAVs provides flexible edge computing services. In this model, tasks are executed on the local edge server first. When the computing resources of the local edge server cannot meet the computational requirements of the task, the system will dispatch the UAVs. Task will be offloaded to UAV for execution. Considering that the endurance of UAVs is a tough problem under the current technical level. Our aim is to minimize the energy consumption of UAVs under the premise of satisfying the UEs demands as much as possible to achieve a higher resource utilization rate.

Multi-Graph Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Network for Metro Passenger Flow Prediction","abstract":"Short-term passenger flow forecasting is significantly important in the urban rail transit system. However, there are many factors that affect passenger flows, and traditional statistical prediction methods are unable to model these complex factors comprehensively. Emerging deep learning models have become effective methods to overcome this problem. In this study, we propose a new deep learning model MGSTCN (Multi-Graph Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Network) to predict short-term passenger flows for all stations in an urban subway network. Specifically, MGSTCN is composed of three modules with the same structure, which models the temporal dependencies of passenger flows in three different time scales, i.e., recent, daily and weekly periods respectively. Each module contains three main components: a multi-graph convolutional layer, a feature fusion layer, and a recurrent neural network. In addition, we construct three topological graphs based on the subway network, station attributes, and passenger flow trends, to extract spatial features from different perspectives through graph convolutional networks. Besides, we also employ some external factors such as weather conditions and holidays to enhance the forecasting accuracy of our proposed model. We conduct experiments based on two real-world passenger flow datasets in Shanghai and Hangzhou, respectively. The results show that our proposed model has superior performance compared to the baselines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546907/","accessionNumber":"21159766","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9546907/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MGSTCN: A Multi-Graph Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Network for Metro Passenger Flow Prediction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009002","fundingName":"Shanghai University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MGSTCN: A Multi-Graph Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Network for Metro Passenger Flow Prediction","confLoc":"Deqing, China","sourcePdf":"425200a164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.153338S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9546842","isNumber":"9546845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9546842","xplore-issue":"9546845","articleId":"9546907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9546916,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"9546916","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9546916","abstract":"Presents the table of contents for this issue of the publication.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2021.3108304","startPage":"C1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/9546915/09546916.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2021.3108304","endPage":"C4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9546915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Table of contents","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546916/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Table of contents","volume":"68","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Table of contents","sourcePdf":"68tcsii10-contents-3108304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018274S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","isNumber":"9546915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","articleId":"9546916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9546918,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"9546918","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"abstract":"These instructions give guidelines for preparing papers for this publication.

It consists of a transmitter (TX), based on a multiplier chain, and a receiver (RX), based on a two-step IQ down-conversion. Those chips share an external, 17.5 GHz, reference to secure frequency synchronization between them. To increase the overall system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the TX is modulated with a low-frequency sine-wave signal, while a two-way LO power combining is implemented for the RX first mixer. Those techniques result in a measured TX effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 10 dBm and RX noise figure (NF) of 27 dB, leading to the overall SNR of 52 dB (at a distance of 25 cm and a resolution bandwidth (RBW) of 100 kHz).

The prime aim of this review paper is to discuss the key concept of a passive chipless RFID sensor and its classification according to fundamental sensing parameters. The fundamental sensing parameter refers to the intrinsic characteristics of a sensor that is sensitive to an environmental parameter to be sensed. The widely used intrinsic parameters are effective permittivity, effective electrical length, and electromagnetic coupling. The categorization of frequency-coded passive chipless RFID sensors based on fundamental sensing parameters facilitates the future researcher to better understand the operating principle of the diverse RFID sensors. The improved understanding helps in the advanced design and implementation of RFID sensors. In addition, the key performance measures and recent areas of applications are discussed.

The RL aims to overcome the difficulty coming from solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, and it is performed via iterating both critic and actor each other, where the critic is for improving the control performance and the actor is for executing the control behavior. In mathematics, a QUAV system is composed of two connected subsystems that are, respectively, modeled by the translational and rotational dynamic equations, which are coupled via a rotation matrix; hence, the optimized tracking scheme is composed of two interconnected individual controls corresponding to the position and attitude, respectively. To achieve the two optimized position and attitude controls, the RL is constructed on the basis of the neural network (NN) approximation of the HJB equation's solution by utilizing NN's outstanding function approximation ability. Particularly, the position control is accomplished by introducing an intermediate control because the translational dynamic is an underactuated system. Since the proposed RL algorithm is significantly simple in comparison with the published methods, the optimized QUAV control can be easily executed in practical applications. Finally, the results are demonstrated by a Lyapunov stability analysis and a numerical simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9546986/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isEarlyAccess":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Backstepping Tracking Control Using Reinforcement Learning for Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62073045, 62103060, 62173356 and 61603169"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2018MF015 and ZR2019PF021"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Project of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"2019GSF109105"}]},"earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Backstepping Tracking Control Using Reinforcement Learning for Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wen-3112688-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019299S","isNumber":"6376248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","articleId":"9546986","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":9547002,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed B.

On this basis, learning based classification methods, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN), are used to classify the different channel types. To further reduce the computational complexity, we leverage data extraction and data truncation.

Since developing memory controllers for different applications is time-consuming, this paper introduces a modular and programmable memory controller that can be configured for different target applications on available hardware resources. The proposed memory controller efficiently supports cache-line accesses along with bulk memory transfers. The user can configure the controller depending on the available logic resources on the FPGA, memory access pattern, and external memory specifications. The modular design supports various memory access optimization techniques including, request scheduling, internal caching, and direct memory access. These techniques contribute to reducing the overall latency while maintaining high sustained bandwidth. We implement the system on a state-of-the-art FPGA and evaluate its performance using two widely studied domains: graph analytics and deep learning workloads. We show improved overall memory access time up to 58% on CNN and GCN workloads compared with commercial memory controller IPs.","doi":"10.1109/HOTI52880.2021.00020","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects (HOTI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects (HOTI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9547004/9547005/09547044.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOTI52880.2021.00020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9547005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programmable FPGA-based Memory Controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547044/","displayDocTitle":"Programmable FPGA-based Memory Controller","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9547044/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100014121","fundingName":"Xilinx"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programmable FPGA-based Memory Controller","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"324800a043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075546S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9547004","isNumber":"9547005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9547004","xplore-issue":"9547005","articleId":"9547044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9547047,"authors":[{"name":"Arpan Jain","affiliation":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA"],"firstName":"Arpan","lastName":"Jain","id":"37087084894"},{"name":"Nawras Alnaasan","affiliation":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA"],"firstName":"Nawras","lastName":"Alnaasan","id":"37088979267"},{"name":"Aamir Shafi","affiliation":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA"],"firstName":"Aamir","lastName":"Shafi","id":"37299751600"},{"name":"Hari Subramoni","affiliation":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA"],"firstName":"Hari","lastName":"Subramoni","id":"37393051700"},{"name":"Dhabaleswar K Panda","affiliation":["The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA"],"firstName":"Dhabaleswar K","lastName":"Panda","id":"37275239100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3248-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3249-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5569"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1550-4794"}],"articleNumber":"9547047","dbTime":"47 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Adaptation models","Program processors","Machine learning algorithms","Data analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNN Training","DPU","CPU","Offloading","PyTorch","ARM","Horovod","MPI"]}],"abstract":"The Deep Learning (DL) training process consists of multiple phases \u2014 data augmentation, training, and validation of the trained model. Traditionally, these phases are executed either on the CPUs or GPUs in a serial fashion due to lack of additional computing resources to offload independent phases of DL training. Recently, Mellanox/NVIDIA has introduced the BlueField-2 DPUs which combine the advanced capabilities of traditional ASIC based network adapters with an array of ARM processors. In this paper, we characterize and explore how one can take advantage of the additional ARM cores on the BlueField-2 DPUs to intelligently accelerate different phases of DL training. We propose multiple novel designs to efficiently offload the phases of DL training to the DPUs. We evaluate our proposed designs using multiple DL models on state-of-the-art HPC clusters. Our experimental results show that the proposed designs are able to deliver up to 15% improvement in overall DL training time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the use of DPUs to accelerate DL training.","doi":"10.1109/HOTI52880.2021.00017","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects (HOTI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects (HOTI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9547004/9547005/09547047.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOTI52880.2021.00017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9547005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating CPU-based Distributed DNN Training on Modern HPC Clusters using BlueField-2 DPUs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547047/","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating CPU-based Distributed DNN Training on Modern HPC Clusters using BlueField-2 DPUs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9547047/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"#1818253,#1854828,#1931537,#2007991,#2018627"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating CPU-based Distributed DNN Training on Modern HPC Clusters using BlueField-2 DPUs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"324800a017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084204S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9547004","isNumber":"9547005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9547004","xplore-issue":"9547005","articleId":"9547047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9547081,"authors":[{"name":"Guanhua Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Beijing, P.

For this reason, analyses based on capacity and robustness are not fully representative, and different aspects such as energy consumption, interference management, or latency must be taken into account. Specifically, energy consumption and efficiency are of special relevance in future wireless communications due to the requirements of the receivers. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques have shown significant system capacity and reliability gains compared to Time Domain Multiple Access (TDMA). However, its energy impact in broadcast/unicast convergence networks has not been studied. This work analyzes the impact of using jointly 5G and NOMA from the transmitter and the receiver point of view. On the one hand, it is proposed to use the gain provided by NOMA to reduce the transmitted power while offering the same services as in TDMA. The receiver analysis considers different use cases: fixed receivers of individualized quality improvement services, mobile video receivers, and IoT devices. The evaluation metrics are energy efficiency and consumption. The results indicate that NOMA provides gains from the transmitter point of view and reduces the energy consumption of sporadic content downloads. On the contrary, TDMA is a better candidate from the receiver enerav efficiency point of view.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB53066.2021.9547115","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9547051/9547014/09547115.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB53066.2021.9547115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9547014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in 5G from the Energy Efficiency Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547115/","displayDocTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in 5G from the Energy Efficiency Perspective","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"4 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547115/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in 5G from the Energy Efficiency Perspective","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"paper_110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075647S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9547051","isNumber":"9547014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9547051","xplore-issue":"9547014","articleId":"9547115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9547118,"authors":[{"name":"Yanqi Huang","affiliation":["DRIVE EA1859, Univ.

In order to improve the position accuracy, the aim of this study is to investigate the method of the 5G NR subcarrier selection. A certain number of PRSs are obtained from the signal source of 192 subcarriers, and the minimum positioning error(PE) is calculated by using particle swarm optimization(PSO) algorithm. Then the relationship between the PRS with the minimum PE and the position of the subcarrier is analyzed which achieved the subcarrier extraction. The experimental results show that the average PE of this scheme is below 6 cm, and the minimum PE can reach 0.05 cm. This approach is confirmed the feasibility of high accuracy in 5G indoor VLP application and has the potential to be extended to larger and more complex 5G-PPP scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB53066.2021.9547118","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting

(MBMS)-dedicated cell, multipath aliasing is an inevitable challenge for CAS reception in long delay spread channels. Meanwhile, traditional Channel Estimation (CHE) algorithms may not work well in such scenarios. For overcoming this problem, an Aliasing-Elimination CHE (AE-CHE) algorithm was proposed. This novel algorithm utilizes the pre-decoded Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) to generate a full-symbol length multipath distribution. By using the multipath distribution, aliasing errors could be eliminated effectively. However, previous researches are mainly based on ideal factors such as perfect PBCH decoding, static channel without Doppler spread, which does not match the actual situation in practical receivers. This paper studies the effects of actual PBCH decoding ability and Doppler spread of time-variant channels on the performance of the AE-CHE algorithm. Analysis and simulation results show that the AE-CHE algorithm could also outperform the traditional algorithms even in the presence of non-ideal factors.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB53066.2021.9547134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9547014","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel7/9547051/9547014/09547134.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB53066.2021.9547134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Aliasing-Elimination for CAS Channel Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital multimedia broadcasting","Multicast algorithms","Simulation","Channel hot electron injection","Channel estimation","Receivers","Decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MBMS-dedicated cell","CAS","PBCH","channel estimation","multipath aliasing","long delay spread channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"On the Aliasing-Elimination for CAS Channel Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547134/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9547134/","publicationDate":"4 Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007219","fundingName":"Shanghai Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"19ZR1426600"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Aliasing-Elimination for CAS Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"paper_45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052984S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9547051","isNumber":"9547014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9547051","xplore-issue":"9547014","articleId":"9547134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9547145,"authors":[{"name":"Hoiyoon Jung","affiliation":["Media Broadcasting Research Section, ETRI, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hoiyoon","lastName":"Jung","id":"37086426738"},{"name":"Sung-Ik Park","affiliation":["Media Broadcasting Research Section, ETRI, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Ik","lastName":"Park","id":"37280893600"},{"name":"Bo-mi Lim","affiliation":["Media Broadcasting Research Section, ETRI, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bo-mi","lastName":"Lim","id":"37085627213"},{"name":"Haechan Kwon","affiliation":["Media Broadcasting Research Section, ETRI, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Haechan","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37088808565"},{"name":"Namho Hur","affiliation":["Media Broadcasting Research Section, ETRI, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Namho","lastName":"Hur","id":"37285758900"},{"name":"Sungho Jeon","affiliation":["Korea Broadcasting System (KBS), Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37292893500"},{"name":"Hyeongseok Kim","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Major of Maritime AI Convergence, Korea Maritime and Ocean University (KMOU), Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeongseok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086166309"},{"name":"Jeongchang Kim","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Major of Maritime AI Convergence, Korea Maritime and Ocean University (KMOU), Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeongchang","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293495200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4908-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4909-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2155-5044"}],"articleNumber":"9547145","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System performance","Laboratories","Broadcasting","Broadband communication","Reliability","Multimedia communication","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ATSC 3.0","MIMO","XPD"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an impact of cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) for the ATSC 3.0 MIMO system.

Though traditional hybrid precoding with fixed architectures has reached its limits, the flexibility of hybrid precoding has not been fully exploited, which gives insight to improve the performance further. In this paper, we adopt a novel architecture called dynamic-subarray, where the connection between radio-frequency (RF) chains and antennas can be dynamically changed by switches. We propose a low-complexity scheme to design the hybrid precoder with dynamic subarrays.

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed CNN model has been accelerated based on Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs) policy. The proposed CLR-CNN model achieved a high accuracy to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical text-based CAPTCHAs of 99.87% and 99.66%, respectively.

Traditional methods are more likely to cause lower recognition accuracy with higher computational complexity in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Feature redundancy especially for handcrafted features is one of the shortcomings of deep-learning-based methods. In this article, a novel end-to-end sequence-based network that consists of a shallow convolutional neural network, a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network strengthening with a self-attention mechanism, and a dense neural network is constructed to recognize eight kinds of intrapulse modulations of radar signals. The autocorrelation functions of received radar signals are first calculated as autocorrelation features. Then, these features are employed as inputs of the proposed network which owns significant sequence processing advantages and adaptive selection ability of features. Finally, the proposed network outputs prediction modulations directly. The simulation results verify the robustness and effectiveness of autocorrelation features. And the proposed network achieves about 61.25% accuracy at \u221220 dB and more than 95% accuracy at \u221210 dB. Compared with four state-of-the-art networks, the proposed network has better recognition performance especially at low SNRs with much lower computational complexity. Results on measured signals also demonstrate that the proposed network outperforms these four networks.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2021.3112199","startPage":"5160","endPage":"5172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2021.3112199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9601323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/9601323/09547203.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Attention Bi-LSTM Networks for Radar Signal Modulation Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547203/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Self-Attention Bi-LSTM Networks for Radar Signal Modulation Recognition","volume":"69","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9547203/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501098"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project","grantNumber":"2015M570778"},{"fundingName":"High Resolution Earth Observation Youth Foundation","grantNumber":"GFZX04061502"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Attention Bi-LSTM Networks for Radar Signal Modulation Recognition","sourcePdf":"tmtt-qu-3112199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085355S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"9601323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","xplore-issue":"9601323","articleId":"9547203","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9547204,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Nur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics, Adiyaman University, 02040 Adiyaman, Turkey (e-mail: anur@adiyaman.edu.tr)"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Nur","orcid":"0000-0001-5469-419X"},{"name":"Asim Kaygusuz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc University, 44000 Malatya, Turkey."],"firstName":"Asim","lastName":"Kaygusuz"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2694-1783"}],"articleNumber":"9547204","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547204","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admittance","Voltage","Power systems","Mathematical models","Hybrid power systems","Generators","Reactive power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gauss-Seidel method","load flow analysis","Newton-Raphson method","power distribution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICJECE.2021.3097447","endPage":"8","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9349829/9429861/09547204.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICJECE.2021.3097447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9429861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Flow Analysis With Newton-Raphson and Gauss-Seidel Methods in a Hybrid AC/DC System Analyse du flux de charge avec les m\u00e9thodes Newton-Raphson et Gauss-Seidel dans un syst\u00e8me AC/DC hybride","abstract":"In this study, a dc system was added to the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system (RDS) test system using voltage-source converters (VSCs), and a hybrid ac/dc system was designed. For this designed system, a load flow analysis was made under the MATLAB platform. The Gauss-Seidel and Newton-Raphson methods, which are widely used in load flow analysis, are used. Comparisons of these methods were made according to the number of iterations, total line losses, and active and reactive powers generated and consumed in terms of different tolerance values. In the results obtained from the load flow analysis studies, the powers produced by the generator are calculated as close to each other according to the load demands for both methods. However, it was seen that the least iteration number and the least power loss were obtained by the Newton-Raphson method. According to the results obtained as a result of applying the power flow algorithm used in the hybrid ac/dc system, it has been proven that this algorithm is successfully applied to the solution of a power system problem. In addition, the results show that the designed system is accurate and reliable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547204/","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Load Flow Analysis With Newton-Raphson and Gauss-Seidel Methods in a Hybrid AC/DC System Analyse du flux de charge avec les m\u00e9thodes Newton-Raphson et Gauss-Seidel dans un syst\u00e8me AC/DC hybride","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Flow Analysis With Newton-Raphson and Gauss-Seidel Methods in a Hybrid AC/DC System Analyse du flux de charge avec les m\u00e9thodes Newton-Raphson et Gauss-Seidel dans un syst\u00e8me AC/DC hybride","sourcePdf":"icjece-nur-3097447-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030543S","isNumber":"9429861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9349829","articleId":"9547204","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":9547205,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos A.

By taking advantage of the FD-SOI substrate characteristics, the forward-body-biasing (FBB) technique is applied in order to improve switch conductances. In addition, a sizing exploration of standard N-type and flipped-well P-type devices operating as switches is advanced, in order to provide optimum balance between their conductances. Extensive simulation results validate the proper operation of the charge pump at a minimum input voltage of 150 mV, and show a maximum efficiency peak of 63.3% at an input voltage of 350 mV and load a current of 500 nA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"68","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547205/","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Stage Charge Pump With Forward Body Biasing in 28 nm UTBB FD-SOI CMOS","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004586","fundingName":"Brazilian Research Funding Agencies CNPq and FAPERJ"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"PIBIC/CEFET-RJ Fellowship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Stage Charge Pump With Forward Body Biasing in 28 nm UTBB FD-SOI CMOS","sourcePdf":"tcsi-pinheirojunior-3112993-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107382S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9610147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9610147","articleId":"9547205","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9547206,"authors":[{"name":"Jiannan Huang","affiliation":["University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Qualcomm Inc, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9583614/9547206/huang-3112635-small.gif","p":["Jiannan Huang (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from both the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, with outstanding achievement, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2016, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) from the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, CA, USA, in 2018 and 2021, respectively.","In 2021, he joined Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, as a Senior Design Engineer, developing high-performance analog-to- digital converters.

Simulation results confirm that the proposed protocol can cope well with both Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) environments and has a great impact on improving the packet delivery ratio, and the delay, while attaining acceptable overhead and hops count among all vehicles.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09547221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"131260","endPage":"131272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Greedy Hybrid Bio-Inspired Routing Protocol to Improve IoV","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Greedy Hybrid Bio-Inspired Routing Protocol to Improve IoV","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547221/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Advanced Greedy Hybrid Bio-Inspired Routing Protocol to Improve IoV","sourcePdf":"access-attia-3114646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102347S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9547221","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9547257,"authors":[{"name":"Shiwen He","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shiwen","lastName":"He","orcid":"0000-0003-0549-4970"},{"name":"Jun Yuan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yuan"},{"name":"Zhenyu An","affiliation":["Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"An","orcid":"0000-0002-8672-2009"},{"name":"Yunshan Yi","affiliation":["Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yunshan","lastName":"Yi"},{"name":"Yongming Huang","affiliation":["Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yongming","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0003-3616-4616"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9547257","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Ultra-reliability and low latency communication has long been an important but challenging task in the fifth and sixth generation wireless communication systems. Scheduling as many users as possible to serve on the limited time-frequency resource is one of a crucial topic, subjecting to the maximum allowable transmission power and the minimum rate requirement of each user. We address it by proposing a mixed integer programming model, with the goal of maximizing the set cardinality of users instead of maximizing the system sum rate or energy efficiency. Mathematical transformations and successive convex approximation are combined to solve the complex optimization problem. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves a considerable performance compared with exhaustive search method, but with lower computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing the Set Cardinality of Users Scheduled for Ultra-Dense uRLLC Networks","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3115125","endPage":"3955","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09547257.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","startPage":"3952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3115125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547257","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Ultra reliable low latency communication","Array signal processing","Downlink","Uncertainty","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultra-reliability low latency communications","user scheduling","beamforming","non-convex optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing the Set Cardinality of Users Scheduled for Ultra-Dense uRLLC Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9547257/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62171474 and 61720106003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004735","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province","grantNumber":"2020JJ4745"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing the Set Cardinality of Users Scheduled for Ultra-Dense uRLLC Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-an-3115125-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085021S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9547257","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9547268,"authors":[{"name":"Jinrui Gan","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence on Electric Power System State Grid Corporation Joint Laboratory (GEIRI), Global Energy Interconnection Research Institute Company Ltd., Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9547268/gan-3115141-small.gif","p":["Jinrui Gan received the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2019.

However, accurate identification of possible failures of the monitoring equipment remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel deep architecture to improve the assessment of abnormalities by considering a novel mutual-guided convolutional attention network (MGCAN) and a multi-region scheme. More specifically, the MGCAN exploits various adequate, low-level information to generate spatial and structural flows. Accordingly, it further extends attention mechanisms to model both inter-flow correlations and inter-channel relationships in the network design. The multi-region scheme features a spatial pyramid random-crop strategy and a region-fusion strategy to handle locally non-uniform characteristics among categories. In this way, the whole architecture provides an end-to-end and adaptive learning procedure relevant to quality perception that focuses on learning important features and mining discriminative regions. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority to prior methods for judging abnormalities. The proposed method can be easily extended to an entire surveillance system.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09547268.pdf","startPage":"132233","endPage":"132240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MGCAN: A Novel Method for Visual Power Monitoring Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547268/","displayDocTitle":"MGCAN: A Novel Method for Visual Power Monitoring Systems","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9547268/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010880","fundingName":"State Grid Corporation of China Headquarters Project Which is \u2018Research on Small Sample Training Method Based on Deep Neural Network and its Application in Power System\u2019","grantNumber":"5400-202158333A-0-0-00"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"MGCAN: A Novel Method for Visual Power Monitoring Systems","sourcePdf":"access-gan-3115141-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087983S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9547268","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9547273,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Zeng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9547273/zeng-3115115-small.gif","p":["Cheng Zeng (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2019.

This paper considers a USV-enabled maritime wireless network, where a USV is employed to assist the communication between the terrestrial base station and ships. Considering the maritime environment characteristics and earth curvature, we establish the systematic USV kinetics and information transmission models. To guarantee fairness, we aim to maximize the minimum expected throughput overall ships by jointly optimizing the trajectory and communication resource allocation, subject to the constraints of the USV kinetics, safe sailing, breakpoint distances, line-of-sight links, resource allocation, and information-causality. Due to the complexity of the maritime two-ray signal propagation model, we propose a channel approximation method to find an upper bound of the throughput for the original problem. By the problem decomposition, two sub-problems are derived and solved iteratively using successive convex approximation and interior-point methods. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that USV can significantly improve transmission performance in maritime wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3115115","startPage":"8100","endPage":"8115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3115115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09547273.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Optimization of Trajectory and Communication Resource Allocation for Unmanned Surface Vehicle Enabled Maritime Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547273/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimization of Trajectory and Communication Resource Allocation for Unmanned Surface Vehicle Enabled Maritime Wireless Networks","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9547273/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1807803"},{"fundingName":"Key International Cooperation Research Project","grantNumber":"61720106003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimization of Trajectory and Communication Resource Allocation for Unmanned Surface Vehicle Enabled Maritime Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zeng-3115115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126187S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9547273","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9547274,"authors":[{"name":"Marwa Zamzam","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Technology, German University in Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9547274/zamza-3115157-small.gif","p":["Marwa Zamzam (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in networking engineering from the Faculty of Information Engineering and Technology, German University in Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt, in 2016 and 2018, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Networks, Faculty of Information Engineering and Technology.

Highly accurate localization techniques impose high latency and high energy consumption on the underlying application system. Thus, for such indoor location-based application, offloading the computation of the localization process to a remote server with high resource capability has been recently introduced as an avenue to address such a challenge. In this paper, a computation offloading problem is formulated to find the optimal decision with regard to the operation of the localization process. This decision includes: a) Where to compute the localization task, either locally on the end device or on the edge server or on the cloud server, b) Which localization technique should be used, and finally, c) Which transmission technology is recommended to be chosen in combination with the localization technique. All these decisions are constrained by the device, and the servers resource capabilities load. They are also constrained by the fact that the localization algorithm has to satisfy a certain application QoS requirement. Within such context, three algorithms are proposed for task offload decision making. First, the Indoor Localization Latency Optimal Offloading algorithm, which finds the optimal offloading decision that minimizes the total latency of the system and is considered a benchmark for the other algorithms. Second, Indoor Localization Latency Centralized Offloading algorithm that finds a sub optimal solution with lower complexity. Third, Indoor Localization Latency Game-Theoretic Offloading decentralized algorithm that converges after finite improvement steps and achieves Nash equilibrium. Altogether, the paper finds the optimum localization strategy for all users with the minimum latency under mobile edge computing environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Minimized Latency Collaborative Computation Offloading Game Under Mobile Edge Computing for Indoor Localization","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115157","startPage":"133861","endPage":"133874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09547274.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Minimized Latency Collaborative Computation Offloading Game Under Mobile Edge Computing for Indoor Localization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9547274/","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Minimized Latency Collaborative Computation Offloading Game Under Mobile Edge Computing for Indoor Localization","sourcePdf":"access-zamzam-3115157-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134994S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9547274","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9547278,"authors":[{"name":"Merlijn Sebrechts","affiliation":["IDLab, Ghent University - imec, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9547278/sebre-3115438-small.gif","p":["Merlijn Sebrechts received the M.Sc. degree in information engineering technology from Ghent University, in July 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with imec, IDLab, Department of Information Technology (INTEC).

In such an environment, multiple companies work together with government on applications and data streams spanning several management domains. Deploying these applications, each of which consists of several connected services, and maintaining an overview of application topologies remains difficult. Even though cloud modelling languages have been proposed to solve similar issues, they are not well fit for such a heterogeneous environment because they often require an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach. Moreover, cloud modelling languages add an additional abstraction layer that rarely supports all features of the underlying platform and make it harder to reuse existing knowledge and tools. This research defines \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">service relationships</i>\n as the key element to modelling applications as topologies of services. We use this definition to pinpoint what is lacking in the state of the art Kubernetes orchestration tools and provide a blueprint for how relationship support can be added to any orchestrator. We present \u201corcon\u201d, a proof of concept orchestrator that extends the Kubernetes API to allow managing relationships between services by adding metadata to service definitions. Our evaluation shows this orchestrator enables lifecycle synchronization and configuration change propagation with an overhead of only 0.44 seconds per service.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

One of its main problems is how to efficiently obtain rich information (geometric structure) and identify useful features from higher dimensions. A light field camera, due to its special microlens array structure, can completely record the angular-spatial information of scenes, which is attractive and has great potential to improve the performance of semantic segmentation tasks. Inspired by this, we propose an end-to-end semantic segmentation network that can process light field macropixel images robustly and extract their features. In addition, this network can flexibly and efficiently load the different popular deep learning backbones. Furthermore, we propose an efficient angular model, which, to learn the angular features between the different viewpoints of the macropixel image, improves the nonlinearity of angular-spatial features and enhances multichannel semantic correlations. To evaluate the network, we construct a new real scene light field dataset comprising 800 high-quality samples. The quantitative and qualitative results show that the highest mean intersection over union (mIoU) based on our algorithm is greater than 57%. Our algorithm achieves a 10.30% increase compared with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms. In combination with different backbones or multiscale light field macropixel images, the network can also achieve comparable results. This preliminary work demonstrates that the combination of light field imaging and deep learning technology has potential applications in the future study of semantic segmentation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic Segmentation With Light Field Imaging and Convolutional Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3115204","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3115204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09547280.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Semantic Segmentation With Light Field Imaging and Convolutional Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9547280/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2021","isJournal":true,"externalId":"5017214","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61906133, 62020106004, 92048301, 61703304 and 61906134"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic Segmentation With Light Field Imaging and Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tim-shi-3115204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132849S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9547280","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9547281,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Quang Cao","affiliation":["Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9547281/cao-3115120-small.gif","p":["Hung Quang Cao received the B.S. degree in mechatronics engineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2016.

Robot precision is influenced by kinematic and non-kinematic error sources. The EKF algorithm is robust for the nonlinear system with Gaussian noise to identify kinematic parameter errors for kinematic calibration. However, if inappropriate covariance matrices are selected, the EKF algorithm may converge to an incorrect solution. To increase the effectiveness of the EKF algorithm, we propose a DQPSO algorithm that consists of the QPSO-1 and QPSO-2 algorithms. The QPSO-1 algorithm adapts the covariance matrices of measurement noise and process noise, while the QPSO-2 algorithm optimizes the kinematic parameter errors estimated by the EKF algorithm. In addition, the used ANFIS predicts and compensates the non-kinematic error for non-kinematic calibration. Experiments have been performed on a five-bar parallel robot to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the positional accuracy, and is better than the previous methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115120","startPage":"132558","endPage":"132568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09547281.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robot Calibration Method Based on Extended Kalman Filter\u2013Dual Quantum Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547281/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robot Calibration Method Based on Extended Kalman Filter\u2013Dual Quantum Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9547281/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21101893","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)]","grantNumber":"2020R1A2C3011286"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robot Calibration Method Based on Extended Kalman Filter\u2013Dual Quantum Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System","sourcePdf":"access-jeon-3115120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085327S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9547281","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9547286,"authors":[{"name":"Lukas Holzbaur","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering, Technical University of Munich (TUM), M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Lukas Holzbaur (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany, in 2014 and 2017, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute for Communications Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. Wachter-Zeh.

Adaptive Neural-Network-Based Consensus Tracking Control for Nonlinear Multiagent Systems With Zero Tracking Error","abstract":"This paper is dedicated to addressing the predefined-time consensus tracking control problem for unknown high-order nonlinear multiagent systems. The prominent difference compared with some existing papers is that the follower is modeled in the form of non-strict-feedback structure. Meanwhile, instead of being constants, the real control gains are unknown functions. A distinct advantage in our work is that the outputs of followers are able to track the output of leader within the time specified in advance. In order to get our desired predefined-time controller, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNS) are applied to compensate those unknown nonlinearities. Then in the design framework of adaptive backstepping, the predefined-time virtual control laws are presented and their derivatives are approximated by using finite-time differentiators. Under our proposed predefined-time controller, it is rigorously demonstrated that the whole closed-loop system remains stable and all outputs of the followers track the reference signal in predefined time. In the end, a simulation example is given to ulteriorly verify the efficacy of the suggested predefined-time control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547323/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21101858","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9547323/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Predefined-Time Adaptive Neural-Network-Based Consensus Tracking Control for Nonlinear Multiagent Systems With Zero Tracking Error","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61873151, 61773192, 61773246 and 61803225"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China","grantNumber":"ZR2019MF009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010029","fundingName":"Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province of China","grantNumber":"tsqn201909078"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Major Program of Shandong Province Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ZR2018ZB0419"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Predefined-Time Adaptive Neural-Network-Based Consensus Tracking Control for Nonlinear Multiagent Systems With Zero Tracking Error","sourcePdf":"access-niu-3115118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127026S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9547323","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9547326,"authors":[{"name":"Ang Huang","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation and Optoelectronic Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China","Shenyuan Honor College, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9547326/huang-3115210-small.gif","p":["Ang Huang received the B.Sc. degree from the Instrumentation and Optoelectronic Engineering and Honor College, Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include hardware design of high-performance electrical and optical tomography systems."]},"firstName":"Ang","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0001-8550-8783","id":"37086133346"},{"name":"Zhang Cao","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation and Optoelectronic Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China","Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9547326/cao-3115210-small.gif","p":["Zhang Cao (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in automation and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in measurement technology and automatic devices from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2003, 2005, and 2008, respectively.","Since 2008, he has been with Beihang University, Beijing, China.

The network implemented on the FPGA extracts the peak values of normalized second harmonics of absorption spectra. A recursive demodulator based on a Kalman filter generates outputs of the training database. Compared with the typical quadrature demodulator, the sampling time of the BP neural network drops to one-quarter of the typical one, with a 5 dB increase in the SNR at different noise levels. To verify and evaluate the proposed method, the FPGA-based 32-bit fixed-point BP neural network was compared with the floating-point BP neural network and the quadrature demodulator in numerical simulations. In the real experiments, Bunsen burner flames with acoustic excitation were imaged, and noisy distortions of the normalized second harmonics and average temperature were effectively reduced by using the proposed method. Temporal fluctuations of up to 750 Hz can be clearly identified from variations of reconstructed distributions of temperature and water vapor molar concentration, in which cases the typical quadrature demodulator failed to work. These results showed that the proposed method works well in the FPGA chip and reveals more details in dynamic flame monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3115210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09547326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3115210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-Based On-Chip Neural Network for TDLAS Tomography in Dynamic Flames","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-Based On-Chip Neural Network for TDLAS Tomography in Dynamic Flames","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547326/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","isJournal":true,"externalId":"4506911","volume":"70","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547326/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62031002, 61827802, 61620106004 and 61961130393"},{"fundingName":"Newton Advanced Fellowship","grantNumber":"NAF191193"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-Based On-Chip Neural Network for TDLAS Tomography in Dynamic Flames","sourcePdf":"tim-cao-3115210-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160088S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9547326","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9547334,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-5544-4512"},{"name":"Zhi Quan","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Quan","orcid":"0000-0001-8108-2893"},{"name":"Suzhi Bi","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Suzhi","lastName":"Bi","orcid":"0000-0001-6212-690X"},{"name":"Changyuan Yu","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Changyuan","lastName":"Yu","orcid":"0000-0002-3185-0441"},{"name":"Pooi-Yuen Kam","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China","Center for Advanced Microelectronic Devices, NUS Research Institute (NUSRI), Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Pooi-Yuen","lastName":"Kam","orcid":"0000-0001-5543-5034"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9547334","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Generalized mutual information (GMI) has become a key metric for bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) system design and performance analysis. As residual phase noise (RPN) normally exists after imperfect phase estimation, the mostly used mismatched Gaussian receiver is suboptimal for GMI analysis in phase noise. This letter thus analyzes the GMI of BICM systems using 8-ary quadrature-amplitude-modulations (QAM) in the presence of both RPN and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). We will use the maximum-likelihood receiver derived in our earlier work to calculate the GMI of Star-8QAM, Circular-8QAM, Rect-8QAM and 8PSK. The explicit symbol and bit log-likelihood ratios are specifically expressed in amplitude-phase form with RPN considered. Numerical results are given in details to show the GMI comparison in phase noise and the GMI loss compared to the pure AWGN case. It is shown that Star-8QAM is much more tolerant to large RPN. Moreover, the ratio parameters of Rect-8QAM and Star-8QAM are optimized to maximize the GMI as the RPN variance increases. We also optimize the bit mapping for non-Gray 8QAM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Mutual Information Analysis for BICM-8QAM With Residual Phase Noise","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3115233","endPage":"3823","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09547334.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","startPage":"3819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3115233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547334","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","AWGN","Signal to noise ratio","Mutual information","Laser noise","Phase modulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized mutual information (GMI)","bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)","residual phase noise","Star-8QAM","Circular-8QAM","Rect-8QAM","8PSK"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Mutual Information Analysis for BICM-8QAM With Residual Phase Noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9547334/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2019YFB1803305"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571316"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Generalized Mutual Information Analysis for BICM-8QAM With Residual Phase Noise","sourcePdf":"lcomm-quan-3115233-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056263S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9547334","onlineDate":"23 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9547336,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The dc grid provides more flexibility in integrating different forms of renewable energy sources effectively. However, the lack of a reliable protection mechanism remains the main drawback in the growth of dc distribution systems. Unlike ac systems, the absence of a natural zero crossing in dc systems for arc extinction makes the use of a conventional mechanical circuit breaker (MCB) a less reliable solution. The use of a solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB) results in fast fault interruption but reduces the overall efficiency of the system due to the on-state voltage drop of the semiconductor devices. A hybrid circuit breaker (HCB) combining MCB and SSCB yields better static and dynamic performances but the main challenges remains in the demagnetization of the transmission line inductance after a fault interruption and an arc formation between the MCB contacts. This paper proposes a hybrid circuit breaker (HCB) which is suitable for fast fault interruption in low voltage dc (LVDC) systems while alleviating the above issues. Proposed topology employs a semiconductor switch as well as an actively switched capacitor branch in parallel with the main mechanical breaker to facilitate fast current commutation during a fault. The mechanical breaker forming the main branch is turned off at zero voltage. This eliminates the arc formation across the moving contacts of the breaker. Moreover, the fault interruption process does not require a varistor for network demagnetization following the fault current commutation. This paper also presents a discharging mechanism for the capacitor in a practical implementation.

This is because the motor has performance criteria, such as high thrust force, high thrust density, and low thrust ripple. Therefore, different motor models and magnetic modeling have been studied. In these studies, especially the solutions that increase the air-gap magnetic flux density were emphasized. One of the most striking of these motor models is surely the end-iron-free structure. In this study, a single-layer (SL) (two-magnet) end-iron-free structure from a reference study was examined. A double-layer (DL) end-iron-free structure that has higher thrust force in the same motor volume, magnet volume, and parameters was proposed. An analytical approach is first developed, and then, a verification based on finite element analysis was performed. As a result of comparison with the reference study, the proposed motor provided a 10.5% increase in the thrust force and a 9.1% decrease in the thrust ripple. In addition, a design approach developed offers a practical and useful analogy between the DL and the SL.","doi":"10.1109/ICJECE.2021.3094167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9349829/9429861/09547340.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICJECE.2021.3094167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9429861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach to Increase the Thrust Force of Tubular Linear Voice Coil Motor Une nouvelle approche pour augmenter la force de pouss\u00e9e d'un moteur lin\u00e9aire tubulaire \u00e0 bobine mobile","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547340/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to Increase the Thrust Force of Tubular Linear Voice Coil Motor Une nouvelle approche pour augmenter la force de pouss\u00e9e d'un moteur lin\u00e9aire tubulaire \u00e0 bobine mobile","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to Increase the Thrust Force of Tubular Linear Voice Coil Motor Une nouvelle approche pour augmenter la force de pouss\u00e9e d'un moteur lin\u00e9aire tubulaire \u00e0 bobine mobile","sourcePdf":"icjece-mutluer-3094167-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043281S","isNumber":"9429861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9349829","articleId":"9547340","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":9547345,"authors":[{"name":"Chibuzor N.

However, solar power is still unattractive to some consumers due to its unpredictability. Therefore, accurate prediction of solar irradiance continues to be critical for stable solar power. In this article, a proposed methodology to improve PV systems' reliability and stability, using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, is introduced. Time-series long short-term memory (LSTM) network, convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression models were used to predict the city of Johannesburg's solar irradiance. These models were separately trained using the historical meteorological data of Johannesburg. Using the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) as a performance indicator, the ConvLSTM model outperformed all the other models. When the models were individually trained with 80% of one-year input data, the results obtained showed that ConvLSTM recorded an nRMSE value of 4.05%. Results obtained using LSTM, XGBoost, and SVM models came next with nRMSE values of 4.72%, 6.63%, and 7.8%, respectively. The RF model gave an nRMSE value of 19.8%, whereas the CNN time-series model recorded an nRMSE value of 12.61%. The best experimental result obtained was an nRMSE value of 1.51% when the ConvLSTM model was trained at 500 epochs using 80% of ten years of actual historical solar irradiance as the dataset. These results suggest that the adoption of the ConvLSTM model for solar irradiance forecasts by solar farm operators in South Africa could improve electricity generation stability for PV connection to the power grid.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9429861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9349829/9429861/09547345.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICJECE.2021.3093369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICJECE.2021.3093369","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting Hourly Solar Radiation Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques Pr\u00e9vision du rayonnement solaire horaire \u00e0 l'aide de techniques d'intelligence artificielle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547345/","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting Hourly Solar Radiation Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques Pr\u00e9vision du rayonnement solaire horaire \u00e0 l'aide de techniques d'intelligence artificielle","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting Hourly Solar Radiation Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques Pr\u00e9vision du rayonnement solaire horaire \u00e0 l'aide de techniques d'intelligence artificielle","sourcePdf":"icjece-alajarmeh-3093369-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028343S","isNumber":"9429861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9349829","citationCount":"1","articleId":"9547345","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":9547382,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Chen","firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Michiel Pertijs","firstName":"Michiel","lastName":"Pertijs"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2644-1349"}],"articleNumber":"9547382","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547382","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transducers","Ultrasonic imaging","Imaging","Probes","Transceivers","Three-dimensional displays","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasound imaging","high-voltage pulsers","analog front-ends","low-noise amplifiers","time-gain compensation","in-probe digitization."]}],"doi":"10.1109/OJSSCS.2021.3115398","endPage":"1","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Solid-State Circuits Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Solid-State Circuits Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782712/9530264/09547382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJSSCS.2021.3115398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9530264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Transceivers for Emerging Medical Ultrasound Imaging Devices: A Review","abstract":"As medical ultrasound imaging moves from conventional cart-based scanners to new form factors such as imaging catheters, hand-held point-of-care scanners and ultrasound patches, there is an increasing need for integrated transceivers that can be closely integrated with the transducer to provide channel-count reduction, improved signal quality and even full digitization. This paper reviews compact and power-efficient circuit solutions for such transceivers. It starts with a brief overview of ultrasound transducer technologies and the operating principles of the ultrasound transmit-receive signal path. For transmission, high-voltage pulsers are reviewed, from compact unipolar pulsers to multi-level pulsers that provide amplitude control and improved power efficiency. The review of receive circuits starts with low-noise amplifiers as the power-and performance-limiting building block. Solutions for time-gain compensation are discussed, which are essential to reduce signal dynamic range by compensating for the decaying echo-signal amplitude associated with propagation attenuation. Finally, the option of direct digitization of the echo signal at the transducer is discussed. The paper ends with a reflection on future opportunities and challenges in the area of integrated circuits for ultrasound applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547382/","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isOpenAccess":true,"isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Transceivers for Emerging Medical Ultrasound Imaging Devices: A Review","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Integrated Transceivers for Emerging Medical Ultrasound Imaging Devices: A Review","sourcePdf":"ojsscs-3115398-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036745S","isNumber":"9530264","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782712","articleId":"9547382","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":9547415,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Shao","affiliation":["Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA","Infineon Technologies AG, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9684154/9547415/shao-3113862-small.gif","p":["Jian Shao (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in measuring science and technology and instrument from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2013, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, in 2021.","In summer 2019, he was a Design Intern with Silicon Laboratories Inc., Austin, TX.

This advantage comes at a cost, however: greater complexity in the mesh management machinery and challenges with load distribution. With the current trend of increasing heterogeneity in hardware architecture, AMR presents an orthogonal axis of complexity. The usual techniques, such as asynchronous communication and hierarchy management for parallelism and memory that are necessary to obtain reasonable performance are very challenging to reason about with AMR.

Results show that the reproducibility initiative activities have contributed to higher levels of awareness on the part of SC conference technical program participants, and hint at contributing to greater scientific impact for the published papers of the SC conference series.

Future efforts should better decouple the community educational goals from goals that specifically strengthen a research work\u2019s potential for long-term impact through reuse 5\u201310 years down the road.","doi":"10.1109/MCSE.2021.3096678","publicationTitle":"Computing in Science & Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Computing in Science & Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/5992/9547662/09547695.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2021.3096678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9547662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reproducibility Practice in High-Performance Computing: Community Survey Results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547695/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"Reproducibility Practice in High-Performance Computing: Community Survey Results","volume":"23","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547695/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC","grantNumber":"DESC0012704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1846418, ICER-1639759 and ICER-1661918"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reproducibility Practice in High-Performance Computing: Community Survey Results","sourcePdf":"mcse-pale-3096678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038622S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"5992","isNumber":"9547662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5992","xplore-issue":"9547662","articleId":"9547695","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":9547717,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxiang Song","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiang","lastName":"Song","orcid":"0000-0003-4802-9761"},{"name":"Yan Guo","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0001-7398-0829"},{"name":"Ning Li","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-9676-7059"},{"name":"Lixiong Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lixiong","lastName":"Zhang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9547717","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Data models","Time series analysis","Linear programming","Training","Time-domain analysis","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of things","online prediction","time series"]}],"abstract":"Data prediction research is very important for applications based on the Internet of things (IoT). However, the large-scale, high-dimension, and the inevitable missing values seriously hinder accurate prediction result. To meet this challenge, an integrated online prediction model is proposed, which can solve future values prediction and missing values imputation simultaneously in the low-dimensional space. Specifically, we embed the classic prediction models into the objective function of matrix factorization (MF) to obtain low-dimensional embedding parameters, which are then used to construct the prediction model. Furthermore, a rolling prediction mechanism is proposed to update the prediction model when new sampled data comes, based on the online MF with time-varying parameters. Simulation results on four UCI public data sets show the superior performance of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3115042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09547717.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3115042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Online Prediction Model for IoT Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Online Prediction Model for IoT Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547717/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547717/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20211227"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Online Prediction Model for IoT Data","sourcePdf":"lsp-guo-3115042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089938S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9547717","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9547721,"authors":[{"name":"Samrat Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9547721/mukho-3114977-small.gif","p":["Samrat Mukhopadhyay (Member, IEEE) received the B.E. degree from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, the M.E. degree from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and the Ph.D. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2012, 2014, and 2021, respectively.

Often one comes across signals that are not ordinarily sparse but are sparse blockwise. Existing block sparse recovery algorithms like BOMP make the assumption of uniform block size and known block boundaries, which are, however, not very practical in many applications. This paper addresses this problem and proposes a two step procedure, where the first stage is a coarse block location identification stage while the second stage carries out finer localization of a non-zero cluster within the window selected in the first stage. A detailed convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out by first defining a so-called pseudoblock-interleaved block RIP for the given generalized block sparse signal and then imposing upper bounds on the corresponding RIC. Simulation results confirm significantly improved performance of the proposed algorithm as compared to BOMP.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3114977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","startPage":"5846","endPage":"5858","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09547721.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two Stage Generalized Block Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (TSGBOMP) Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547721/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Two Stage Generalized Block Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (TSGBOMP) Algorithm","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"69","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two Stage Generalized Block Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (TSGBOMP) Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tsp-chakraborty-3114977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122945S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9547721","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9547723,"authors":[{"name":"Stuart Bennett","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Bennett","orcid":"0000-0003-1951-8013","id":"37088999938"},{"name":"Yoann Noblet","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Yoann","lastName":"Noblet","id":"37704951400"},{"name":"Paul F.

It optically applies a 2D mask to the imaged scene, before performing light integration along a single spatial axis, but previous work has not made use of the architecture's potential for taking measurements sparsely. In this paper we develop a strongly performing static binarized noiselet compressive sampling mask design, tailored to pushframe hardware, allowing both a single exposure per motion time-step, and retention of 2D correlations in the scene. Results from simulated and real-world captures are presented, with performance shown to be similar to that of immobile \u2014 and hence inappropriate for satellite use \u2014 whole-scene imagers. A particular feature of our sampling approach is that the degree of compression can be varied without altering the pattern, and we demonstrate the utility of this for efficiently storing and transmitting multi-spectral images.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9318600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2021.3114980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/9318600/09547723.pdf","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1079","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2021.3114980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sampling Using a Pushframe Camera","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sampling Using a Pushframe Camera","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/9547723/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21200640","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547723/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011690","fundingName":"UK Space Agency"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100020885","fundingName":"Centre for Earth Observation Instrumentation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sampling Using a Pushframe Camera","sourcePdf":"tci-bennett-3114980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079518S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"9318600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","xplore-issue":"9318600","articleId":"9547723","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9547731,"authors":[{"name":"Brian R.

However, while these systems can outperform general-purpose OSes, they have limited ability to support legacy applications. Multi-OS environments, where the application\u2019s execution is split between a control plane and a data plane operating system, can address this challenge, but reasoning about the performance of applications that run in such a split execution environment is currently guided only by expert intuition and empirical analysis. As the level of specialization in system software and hardware continues to increase, there is both a pressing need and ripe opportunity for investigating analytical models that can predict application performance and guide programmers\u2019 intuition when considering multi-OS environments. In this paper we present such a model to place bounds on application speedup, beginning with a simple, intuitive formulation, and progressing to a more refined model. We present an analysis of the model for a diverse set of benchmarks, as well as a prototype tool to project multi-OS speedups for applications on existing systems. Finally, we validate our model on state-of-the-art multi-OS systems, demonstrating that it reliably predicts speedup with 96% average accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9591458/09547731.pdf","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3114984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3114984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Speedup in Multi-OS Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Computational modeling","Hardware","Analytical models","Tools","Linux","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Operating systems","multi-kernels","speedup models","performance modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Speedup in Multi-OS Environments","volume":"33","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/9547731/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 June 2022","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1718252, CNS-1730689, >CNS-1763612, CCF-2028958 and CCF-2029014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Speedup in Multi-OS Environments","sourcePdf":"tpds-tauro-3114984-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120121S","chronDate":"June 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9591458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9591458","articleId":"9547731","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9547738,"authors":[{"name":"Yapeng Miao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/9314330/9547738/miao-3115177-small.gif","p":["Yapeng Miao received the B.S. degree in network engineering from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Hunan University of Technology, Hunan, China, in 2019.

Fundamental model-based unmixing problems can be better reformulated by exploiting sparse constraints in different forms. Gradient-based optimization approaches commonly serve for traditional sparse unmixing, but their limitations such as one-way search, often induce unsatisfactory local optimum, especially when the problems are nonconvex. Therefore, acceptable unmixing performance cannot always be guaranteed, and the sparsity of hyperspectral imagery may be incorrectly expressed. In this article, an unsupervised sparse unmixing method using comprehensive-learning-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. Due to the basic PSO's premature convergence in dealing with high-dimensional problems, double swarms whose fitness functions are accordingly divided into a series of low-dimensional subproblems are constructed to search for optimal endmembers and abundances alternately, leading to the implementation of unmixing in refined solution spaces. Under this framework, two comprehensive learning strategies are introduced to promote and refine particles\u2019 mutual learning deeply at the element-level, through which the abundance sparsity in every local pixel and every endmember's global abundance sparsity can be better exploited and expressed. Experiments with both simulated datasets and real hyperspectral images are employed to validate the performance of the proposed method combined with different sparse constraints. In comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method enables the achievement of better unmixing results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547738/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21126784","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/9547738/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sparse Unmixing for Hyperspectral Imagery via Comprehensive-Learning-Based Particle Swarm Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62001098"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2232020D-33"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sparse Unmixing for Hyperspectral Imagery via Comprehensive-Learning-Based Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"jstars-yang-3115177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157518S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","articleId":"9547738","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":9547754,"authors":[{"name":"Luis A.

For this non-smooth setting, centralized algorithms are known to converge linearly under certain conditions. On the other hand, decentralized algorithms have not been shown to achieve linear convergence under the same conditions. In this work, we propose a decentralized proximal primal-dual algorithm and establish its linear convergence under weaker conditions than existing decentralized works. Our result shows that decentralized algorithms match the linear rate of centralized algorithms without any extra condition. Finally, we provide numerical simulations that illustrate the theoretical findings and show the advantages of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09547761.pdf","startPage":"5568","endPage":"5579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3114978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3114978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual Consensus Proximal Algorithm for Multi-Agent Sharing Problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Signal processing algorithms","Couplings","Sparse matrices","Machine learning algorithms","Topology","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-agent optimization","sharing problem","dual consensus","proximal algorithm","linear convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Dual Consensus Proximal Algorithm for Multi-Agent Sharing Problems","volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9547761/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"DMS-2012439"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Consensus Proximal Algorithm for Multi-Agent Sharing Problems","sourcePdf":"tsp-alghunaim-3114978-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109225S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9547761","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9547768,"authors":[{"name":"Man Luo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9547768/luo-3114985-small.gif","p":["Man Luo received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electronic and communication engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

However, it does not work well for a generic measurement matrix, which may cause AMP to diverge. Damped AMP has been used for SBL to alleviate divergence issues at the cost of reducing convergence speed. In this work, we propose a new SBL algorithm based on structured variational inference, leveraging AMP with a unitary transformation. Both single measurement vector and multiple measurement vector problems are investigated. It is shown that, compared to state-of-the-art AMP-based SBL algorithms, the proposed UAMP-SBL is more robust and efficient, leading to remarkably better performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547768/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unitary Approximate Message Passing for Sparse Bayesian Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP190100786"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"LR21F010001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100020314","fundingName":"QuantERA","grantNumber":"C\u2019MON-QSENS!"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unitary Approximate Message Passing for Sparse Bayesian Learning","sourcePdf":"tsp-guo-3114985-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115484S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9547768","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":9547774,"authors":[{"name":"Kalpesh Prajapati","affiliation":["Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), Surat, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/9263394/9547774/praja-3113783-small.gif","p":["Kalpesh Prajapati received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communication from Dharmsinh Desai University, Nadiad, India, and the master\u2019s degree in automatic control and robotics from The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara, India.

However, one of the prime limitations of existing deep learning-based SISR approaches is that they need supervised training. Specifically, the Low-Resolution (LR) images are obtained through known degradation (for instance, bicubic downsampling) from the High-Resolution (HR) images to provide supervised data as an LR-HR pair. Such training results in a domain shift of learnt models when real-world data is provided with multiple degradation factors not present in the training set. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised approach for the SISR task using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which we refer to hereafter as \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DUS-GAN</i>\n. The novel design of the proposed method accomplishes the SR task without degradation estimation of real-world LR data. In addition, a new human perception-based quality assessment loss, i.e., Mean Opinion Score (MOS), has also been introduced to boost the perceptual quality of SR results. The pertinence of the proposed method is validated with numerous experiments on different reference-based (i.e., NTIRE Real-world SR Challenge validation dataset) and no-reference based (i.e., NTIRE Real-world SR Challenge Track-1 and Track-2) testing datasets. The experimental analysis demonstrates committed improvement from the proposed method over the other state-of-the-art unsupervised SR approaches, both in terms of subjective and quantitative evaluations on different reference metrics (i.e., LPIPS, PI-RMSE graph) and no-reference quality measures such as NIQE, BRISQUE and PIQE. We also provide the implementation of the proposed approach (\n<uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://github.com/kalpeshjp89/DUSGAN</uri>\n) to support reproducible research.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2021.3113783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/9263394/09547774.pdf","startPage":"8251","endPage":"8264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9263394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2021.3113783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Unsupervised Super-Resolution Using Generative Adversarial Network (DUS-GAN) for Real-World Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Direct Unsupervised Super-Resolution Using Generative Adversarial Network (DUS-GAN) for Real-World Data","htmlLink":"/document/9547774/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","publicationDate":"2021","pubMedId":"34559651","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), a statutory body of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India","grantNumber":"ECR/2017/003268"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Unsupervised Super-Resolution Using Generative Adversarial Network (DUS-GAN) for Real-World Data","sourcePdf":"tip-upla-3113783-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17869S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"9263394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","xplore-issue":"9263394","articleId":"9547774","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9547780,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Zhou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, 12569 Changsha, Hunan, China, (e-mail: zhouzhou03201@126.com)"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Kenli Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan unversity, Changsha, Hunan, China, 410082 (e-mail: lkl@hnu.edu.cn)"],"firstName":"Kenli","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Jemal Abawajy","affiliation":["computer science, Deakin University School of Life and Environmental Sciences, 206219 Burwood, Victoria, Australia, (e-mail: jemal.abawajy@deakin.edu.au)"],"firstName":"Jemal","lastName":"Abawajy"},{"name":"Mohammad Shojafar","affiliation":["5G Innovation Centre, University of Surrey, 3660 Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, GU2 7XH (e-mail: m.shojafar@surrey.ac.uk)"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Shojafar"},{"name":"Chowdhury Morshed","affiliation":["School of information, Deakin University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, (e-mail: morshed.chowdhury@deakin.edu.au)"],"firstName":"Chowdhury","lastName":"Morshed"},{"name":"Fangmin Li","affiliation":["Changsha University, 121868 Changsha, Hunan province, China, (e-mail: lifangmin@whut.edu.cn)"],"firstName":"Fangmin","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Keqin Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, State University of New York, New Paltz, New York, United States, 12561 (e-mail: lik@newpaltz.edu)"],"firstName":"Keqin","lastName":"Li"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-3782"},{"format":"CD","value":"2377-3790"}],"articleNumber":"9547780","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547780","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Quality of service","Resource management","Virtualization","Task analysis","Servers","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic resource provisioning","energy-aware algorithm","optimization","resource management","virtualized networked datacenter (VNDC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSUSC.2021.3115388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274860/7742329/09547780.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSUSC.2021.3115388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7742329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Energy-aware Stochastic Task Execution Algorithm in Virtualized Networked Datacenters","abstract":"Virtualized networked datacenters (VNDCs) are gaining considerable attention for stochastic task execution under real-time constraints. However, the problem of efficiently minimizing the high energy consumption while ensuring high quality of service (QoS) in VNDCs has not been fully addressed. Although many solutions have been proposed to address this challenge, they are not efficient and only consider one or two of the energy consuming resources of VNDCs. To this end, an adaptive energy-aware algorithm, MCEC, that efficiently reduces the energy consumption of VNDCs while ensuring high QoS is proposed. Different from the existing approaches, the MCEC algorithm considers energy consumed by computing resources, virtual machine (VM) reconfiguration, communication resources and storage media resources while meeting user QoS requirements defined in the service level agreement (SLA). To validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we carried out extensive experiments and compared the performance of our algorithm with existing baseline algorithms. The results of the experiments show that our algorithm substantially outperforms the baseline algorithms with respect to reducing energy consumption while respecting the service level agreement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","isJournal":true,"isEarlyAccess":true,"volume":"PP","issue":"99","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Energy-aware Stochastic Task Execution Algorithm in Virtualized Networked Datacenters","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Marie Curie Fellowship funded by the European Commission","grantNumber":"MSCA-IF-GF-2019-839255"},{"fundingName":"the National Outstanding Youth Science Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61625202"},{"fundingName":"the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572525 and 61772088"},{"fundingName":"the International Regional Cooperation and Exchange Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61661146006"}]},"earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Energy-aware Stochastic Task Execution Algorithm in Virtualized Networked Datacenters","sourcePdf":"tsusc-3115388-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0881S","isNumber":"7742329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274860","articleId":"9547780","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":9547795,"authors":[{"name":"Yifan Zhu","affiliation":["IoT Thrust, Information Hub, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9547795/zhu-3114999-small.gif","p":["Yifan Zhu (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree from Soochow University, Suzhou, China, in 2016 and the M.S. degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison,Madison, WI, USA, in 2018.

The existing compressive sensing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation approach with a traditional sparsity promoting prior model becomes invalid in the ELAA scenario due to the spatial non-stationary effects caused by the spherical wavefront and visibility region (VR) issue. We therefore propose a new structured prior with the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to promote the structured sparsity of the spatial non-stationary ELAA channel. Based on this, a Bayesian inference problem on the posterior of the ELAA channel coefficients is formulated. In addition, we propose the turbo orthogonal approximate message passing (Turbo-OAMP) algorithm to achieve a low-complexity channel estimation. Comprehensive simulations verify that the proposed algorithm has supreme performance under spatial non-stationary ELAA channels compared to various state-of-the-art baselines.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547795","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Antennas","Antenna arrays","Hidden Markov models","Bayes methods","Scattering","Massive MIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extremely large antenna array","channel estimation","message passing","structured sparsity"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09547795.pdf","startPage":"5463","endPage":"5478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3114999","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3114999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Channel Estimation in Multi-User Massive MIMO With Extremely Large Antenna Array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547795/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Channel Estimation in Multi-User Massive MIMO With Extremely Large Antenna Array","isDynamicHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547795/","volume":"69","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62101472"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"Huawei Technologies"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Channel Estimation in Multi-User Massive MIMO With Extremely Large Antenna Array","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhu-3114999-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106499S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9547795","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9547801,"authors":[{"name":"Zongmeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/9263394/9547801/zhang-3113791-small.gif","p":["Zongmeng Zhang received the B.E. degree from Shandong University in 2021.

However, it is non-trivial since it requires not only the comprehensive understanding of the video and sentence query, but also the accurate semantic correspondence capture between them. Existing efforts are mainly centered on exploring the sequential relation among video clips and query words to reason the video and sentence query, neglecting the other intra-modal relations (\n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>\n, semantic similarity among video clips and syntactic dependency among the query words). Towards this end, in this work, we propose a Multi-modal Interaction Graph Convolutional Network (MIGCN), which jointly explores the complex intra-modal relations and inter-modal interactions residing in the video and sentence query to facilitate the understanding and semantic correspondence capture of the video and sentence query. In addition, we devise an adaptive context-aware localization method, where the context information is taken into the candidate moments and the multi-scale fully connected layers are designed to rank and adjust the boundary of the generated coarse candidate moments with different lengths. Extensive experiments on Charades-STA and ActivityNet datasets demonstrate the promising performance and superior efficiency of our model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"21101669","pubMedId":"34559652","volume":"30","htmlLink":"/document/9547801/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Modal Interaction Graph Convolutional Network for Temporal Language Localization in Videos","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ZR2019JQ23"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Program of Shandong (Major scientific and technological innovation projects)","grantNumber":"2020CXGC010111"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1936203"},{"fundingName":"Young Creative Team in Universities of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"2020KJN012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Modal Interaction Graph Convolutional Network for Temporal Language Localization in Videos","sourcePdf":"tip-song-3113791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184286S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"9263394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","xplore-issue":"9263394","articleId":"9547801","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9547804,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhuan Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Cyberspace Security, College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488902/9644929/9547804/wang-3115104-small.gif","p":["Jinhuan Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degree from the College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China, in 2017 and 2020, respectively.

However, existing research focuses on the basic statistics of certain motifs, largely ignoring the connection patterns among them. Recently, a subgraph network (SGN) model is proposed to study the potential structure among motifs, and it was found that the integration of SGN can enhance a series of graph classification methods. However, SGN model lacks diversity and is of quite high time complexity, making it difficult to widely apply in practice. In this paper, we introduce sampling strategies into SGN, and design a novel sampling subgraph network model, which is scale-controllable and of higher diversity. We also present a structural feature fusion framework to integrate the structural features of diverse sampling SGNs, so as to improve the performance of graph classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, by comparing with the SGN model, our new model indeed has much lower time complexity (reduced by two orders of magnitude) and can enhance a series of graph classification methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Classification algorithms","Social networking (online)","Brain modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network sampling","subgraph network","feature fusion","graph classification","biological network","social network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNSE.2021.3115104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488902/9644929/09547804.pdf","startPage":"3478","endPage":"3490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSE.2021.3115104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Subgraph Network With Application to Graph Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Subgraph Network With Application to Graph Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547804/","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547804/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61973273"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LR19F030001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1006104"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council","grantNumber":"CityU11200317"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Subgraph Network With Application to Graph Classification","sourcePdf":"tnse-xuan-3115104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13377S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"6488902","isNumber":"9644929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488902","xplore-issue":"9644929","articleId":"9547804","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9547806,"authors":[{"name":"Long Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/9619988/9547806/yang-3115128-small.gif","p":["Long Yang (Member, IEEE) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.

By integrating cooperative NOMA into wireless caching, a popularity-oriented cooperative NOMA pushing (POC-NOMA-P) strategy is proposed for content pushing, while a dynamic cooperative NOMA delivery (DC-NOMA-D) strategy is proposed for content delivery. A new analytical framework is designed to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies. Particularly, unlike existing works that purely focused on the analysis of cache hit probability (CHP) and outage probability, our analytical framework further introduces content diversity gain and delivery diversity gain to characterize the performance gain achieved by the use of cooperative NOMA. Moreover, the tradeoff analysis between performance and energy consumption is also included in our analytical framework. To ensure the analysis accuracy and mathematical tractability, a new tight approximation is developed for the cumulative distribution function of channel gain between two spatially random nodes, with which theoretic results are approximately derived for various performance metrics of our analytical framework. Our analytical results demonstrate that compared with the non-cooperative counterparts, the proposed strategies are guaranteed to achieve higher CHP/lower delivery outage probability and largely reduce the energy consumption incurred by content pushing/delivery. Simulations verify the accuracy of our derived approximations for various performance metrics and demonstrate the superiority of POC-NOMA-P and DC-NOMA-D over existing strategies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Wireless communication","Servers","Cogeneration","Diversity methods","Power system reliability","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative NOMA","wireless caching","pushing","delivery","diversity"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9619988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3115128","startPage":"12055","endPage":"12071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/9619988/09547806.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3115128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Application of Cooperative NOMA to Spatially Random Wireless Caching Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Application of Cooperative NOMA to Spatially Random Wireless Caching Networks","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","volume":"70","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9547806/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971320, 61901327, 61901312 and 61771366"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2017-05853"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2021JQ-206"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100021171","fundingName":"Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2020A1515110084"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB210109"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Application of Cooperative NOMA to Spatially Random Wireless Caching Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-3115128-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167479S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9619988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"9619988","articleId":"9547806","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9547814,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyue Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen, 529484 Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, (e-mail: mingyue.wang@my.cityu.edu.hk)"],"firstName":"Mingyue","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yu Guo","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, 47836 Beijing, Haidian, China, 100875 (e-mail: yuguo@bnu.edu.cn)"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Guo"},{"name":"Chen Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, 53025 Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, (e-mail: c.zhang@my.cityu.edu.hk)"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Cong Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, (e-mail: congwang@cityu.edu.hk)"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Hejiao Huang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, (e-mail: huanghejiao@hit.edu.cn)"],"firstName":"Hejiao","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Xiaohua Jia","affiliation":["Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen, 529484 Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, (e-mail: csjia@cityu.edu.hk)"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Jia"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-1374"},{"format":"CD","value":"2372-0204"}],"articleNumber":"9547814","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547814","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blockchains","Medical services","Cryptography","Servers","Encryption","Smart contracts","Indexes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Searchable encryption","decentralized framework","medical data sharing","attribute-based encryption","boolean search"]}],"abstract":"Electronic Health Record (EHR) and its privacy have attracted widespread attention with the development of the healthcare industry in recent years. As locking medical data in a single healthcare center causes information isolation, healthcare centers are motivated to build medical data sharing systems. However, existing systems highly rely on the trusted centralized servers, which are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and the single point of failure. Moreover, it is a non-trivial matter to authorize multiple users to search and access EHR in a privacy-preserving manner. In this paper, we propose MedShare, a decentralized framework for secure EHR sharing. Our design utilizes the smart contract technique of blockchain to establish a trusted platform for healthcare centers to share their encrypted EHR. Considering that fine-grained access control is essential in practical EHR sharing service, we devise a constant-size attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, where the access policy is embedded in search result on the blockchain. Besides, we propose an efficient scheme that enables authorized MedShare users to perform multi-keyword boolean search operations over encrypted EHR. We formally analyze the security strengths and implement the system prototype on Ethereum. Evaluation results demonstrate that MedShare is efficient for EHR sharing.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2021.3114719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/4629387/09547814.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2021.3114719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MedShare: A Privacy-Preserving Medical Data Sharing System by Using Blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"MedShare: A Privacy-Preserving Medical Data Sharing System by Using Blockchain","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Innovation and Technology Commission of Hong Kong under ITF Project","grantNumber":"ITS/145/19"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong under GRF projects CityU","grantNumber":"11213920, 11217620, 11217819 and R6021-20F"},{"fundingName":"NationalKeyRDProgramofChina","grantNumber":"2017YFB0803002"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"310421108"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61732022"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Municipality Science and Technology Innovation Commission","grantNumber":"SGDX20201103093004019"}]},"earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MedShare: A Privacy-Preserving Medical Data Sharing System by Using Blockchain","sourcePdf":"tsc-3114719-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045879S","isNumber":"4629387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","articleId":"9547814","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":9547818,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Kong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Process Control for Light Industry (Ministry of Education), Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Kong","orcid":"0000-0003-2551-4748","id":"37086236229"},{"name":"Qibin He","affiliation":["Jiangsu Provincial Engineering Laboratory of Pattern Recognition and Computational Intelligence, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Qibin","lastName":"He","orcid":"0000-0003-3326-8866","id":"37088998617"},{"name":"Min Jiang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Provincial Engineering Laboratory of Pattern Recognition and Computational Intelligence, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0003-3826-6405","id":"37086234030"},{"name":"Tianshan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Tianshan","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-3831-8893","id":"37088461991"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9547818","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging cross-modality pedestrian retrieval task which aims to match person images between the visible and infrared modality of the same identity. Existing methods usually adopt two-stream network to solve cross-modality gap, but they ignore the pixel-level discrepancy between the visible and infrared images. Some methods introduce auxiliary modalities in the network, but they lack powerful constraints on the feature distribution of multiple modalities. In this letter, we propose a Dynamic Center Aggregation (DCA) loss with mixed modality for VI-ReID. Concretely, we employ a mixed modality as a bridge between the visible and infrared modality, reducing the difference of the two modalities at the pixel-level. The mixed modality is generated by a Dual-modality Feature Mixer (DFM), which combines the features of visible and infrared images. Moreover, we dynamically adjust the relative distance across multi-modality through DCA loss, which is conducive to explore the modality-invariant feature. We evaluate the proposed method on two public available VI-ReID datasets (SYSU-MM01 and RegDB). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09547818.pdf","startPage":"2003","endPage":"2007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3115040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3115040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Center Aggregation Loss With Mixed Modality for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Training","Mixers","Image color analysis","Bridges","Testing","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Person re-identification","cross-modality","mixed modality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Center Aggregation Loss With Mixed Modality for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification","volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9547818/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JUSRP41908"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61362030 and 61201429"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M581720 and 2016M600360"},{"fundingName":"111 Projects","grantNumber":"B12018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Center Aggregation Loss With Mixed Modality for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification","sourcePdf":"lsp-kong-3115040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073411S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9547818","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9547823,"authors":[{"name":"Xiancheng Cheng","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9547823/cheng-3114982-small.gif","p":["Xiancheng Cheng received the B.S. degree in electrical and information engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2016.

Specifically, we propose a framework where the local sensors first collaborate (via a collaboration matrix) with each other. Then a subset of sensors selected to communicate with the FC linearly compress their observations before transmission. We design near-optimal collaboration and linear compression strategies under power constraints via alternating minimization of the sequential minimum mean square error. The objective function for collaboration design is generally non-convex. We establish correspondence between the sparse collaboration matrix and the non-sparse vector consisting of the nonzero elements of the collaboration matrix. Then, we reformulate and solve the collaboration design problem using quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). The compression design problem is solved using the same methodology. We propose two versions of compression design, one centralized scheme where the compression strategies are derived at the FC and decentralized, where the local sensors compute their individual compression strategies independently. Importantly, we show that the proposed methods can also be used for estimating time-varying random vector parameters. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547823","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Collaboration","Wireless sensor networks","Estimation","Sensor systems","Sparse matrices","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","distributed sequential estimation","collaboration-compression framework","energy allocation","semidefinite programming","non-convex QCQP"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09547823.pdf","startPage":"5448","endPage":"5462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3114982","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3114982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Collaboration and Compression Design for Distributed Sequential Estimation in a Wireless Sensor Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547823/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Collaboration and Compression Design for Distributed Sequential Estimation in a Wireless Sensor Network","isDynamicHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547823/","volume":"69","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971323"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Collaboration and Compression Design for Distributed Sequential Estimation in a Wireless Sensor Network","sourcePdf":"tsp-chen-3114982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117279S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9547823","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9547825,"authors":[{"name":"Yanbin Hao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","School of Data Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/9263394/9547825/hao-3113165-small.gif","p":["Yanbin Hao (Member, IEEE) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2012 and 2017, respectively.

Specifically, given an anchor video as a query, machine techniques automatically generate links between the anchor and target videos by modeling and comparing their content aboutness. The term \u201caboutness\u201d specifically refers to contextually relevant multimedia content, i.e., a fragment is on or of something. Since video contents are multi-modal (e.g., audio and vision), the content aboutness may be reflected across different modalities. Existing approaches regard hyperlinking as a retrieval task, by embedding multi-modal video contents into one or multiple common video representation space(s) for cross-modal comparison. As a result, the aboutness between videos is scored by computing the vector-distance based similarity in the learnt common feature space. However, these methods suffer from two main limitations: (1) the video modality descriptors/features are treated equally in representation learning, which hinders the effective modeling of their respective capabilities in linking; and (2) directly using the vector-distance based similarity to measure aboutness bears the risk of returning more duplicates. This paper focuses on addressing these two problems. Specifically, we firstly build attentional neural networks to learn a compact fragment-level representation, assigning different importance weights to different descriptor/feature contents by an attention mechanism. We believe that the potentially interesting content(s) should be highlighted in the representation. Furthermore, instead of directly computing the similarity of two representation embeddings, we secondly build a holographic composition network to model the aboutness for link establishment, with the core use of circular correlation. The two networks string together to form the final hyperlinking matching system. The entire model is trained in an end-to-end fashion. We examine its effectiveness by creating four train/validate/test partitioning schemes on the Blip10000 dataset and employing two video fragmentation methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9547825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9547825/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","publicationDate":"2021","pubMedId":"34559649","volume":"30","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Match Anchor-Target Video Pairs With Dual Attentional Holographic Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1406703 and 2020YFB1406704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872256"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002920","fundingName":"Research Grants Council (RGC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"CityU 11250716"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Match Anchor-Target Video Pairs With Dual Attentional Holographic Networks","sourcePdf":"tip-zhu-3113165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109628S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"9263394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","xplore-issue":"9263394","articleId":"9547825","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9547840,"authors":[{"name":"Huibin Yan","affiliation":["Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Digital Creative Technology, Shenzhen University, ShenZhen, China","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Digital Creative Technology., ShenZhen, China"],"firstName":"Huibin","lastName":"Yan"},{"name":"Shuoyao Wang","affiliation":["Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Digital Creative Technology, Shenzhen University, ShenZhen, China","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Digital Creative Technology., ShenZhen, China"],"firstName":"Shuoyao","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-1395-4383"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9547840","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Signal processing algorithms","Tensors","Measurement","Deep learning","Convergence","Transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image fusion","infrared image"]}],"abstract":"With the fast development of multi-sensor technologies, image fusion has played an essential role in modern military and civilian.

Model-based performance prediction is a practical and fast approach for kernel optimization, specially if done with information from pre-synthesis reports. This article presents an analytical model focused on memory intensive applications that captures the memory behavior and accurately predicts the kernel execution time within seconds rather than hours, as bitstream generation requires. The model has been validated with two DRAM technologies: DDR4 and HBM2, with a set of microbenchmarks and high performance computing applications showing an average error of 11% for DDR4 and 10% for HBM2.

The in-memory Error Correction Code (ECC), which solves this problem, is a widely used technology to improve the yield of highly integrated memory. However, the use of in-memory ECC causes problems that have not been considered in memory repair algorithms. Redundancy analysis is effective for repairing memory with redundant memory and in-memory ECC. In this paper, an ECC-aware fast and reliable pattern matching redundancy analysis algorithm for memory using both spare memory and in-memory ECC is proposed. This algorithm simplifies large-scale fault groups using in-memory ECC and includes an early termination method that can determine whether a memory that cannot be repaired with line spares can be repaired considering in-memory ECC. Experimental results show that the proposed pattern matching redundancy analysis algorithm achieves a similar yield but 14.6% less RA time and 8.6 times higher reliability compared to the existing redundancy analysis algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09548033.pdf","startPage":"133274","endPage":"133288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECC-Aware Fast and Reliable Pattern Matching Redundancy Analysis for Highly Reliable Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"ECC-Aware Fast and Reliable Pattern Matching Redundancy Analysis for Highly Reliable Memory","htmlLink":"/document/9548033/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant"},{"fundingName":"Korean Government through the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)","grantNumber":"2019R1A2C3011079"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"ECC-Aware Fast and Reliable Pattern Matching Redundancy Analysis for Highly Reliable Memory","sourcePdf":"access-kang-3115496-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141008S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548033","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9548034,"authors":[{"name":"V\u00edctor Jim\u00e9nez","affiliation":["Centre for Automation and Robotics (CSIC-UPM), Arganda del Rey, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9548034/jimen-3115664-small.gif","p":["V\u00edctor Jim\u00e9nez was born in Madrid, Spain, in 1993.

Typical approaches rely on plane fitting or local geometric features, but their performance is reduced in situations with sloped terrain or sparse data. Some works address these issues using Markov Random Fields and Belief Propagation, but these rely on local geometric features uniquely. This article presents a strategy for ground segmentation in LiDAR point clouds composed by two main steps: (i) First, an initial classification is performed dividing the points in small groups and analyzing geometric features between them. (ii) Then, this initial classification is used to model the surrounding ground height as a Markov Random Field, which is solved using the Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm. Points are finally classified comparing their height with the estimated ground height map. On one hand, using an initial estimation to model the Markov Random Field provides a better description of the scene than local geometric features commonly used alone. On the other hand, using a graph-based approach with message passing achieves better results than simpler filtering or enhancement techniques, since data propagation compensates sparse distributions of LiDAR point clouds. Experiments are conducted with two different sources of information: nuScenes\u2019s public dataset and an autonomous vehicle prototype. The estimation results are analyzed with respect to other methods, showing a good performance in a variety of situations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548034/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21101920","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ground Segmentation Algorithm for Sloped Terrain and Sparse LiDAR Point Cloud","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100014440","fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the National Project Programmable Systems for Intelligence in Automobiles (PRYSTINE)","grantNumber":"PCI2018-092928"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100014440","fundingName":"National Project Product Security for Cross Domain Reliable Dependable Automated Systems (SECREDAS)","grantNumber":"PCI2018-093144"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012818","fundingName":"Community of Madrid through SEGVAUTO 4.0-CM Programme","grantNumber":"S2018-EMT-4362"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011688","fundingName":"European Commission and Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership (ECSEL) Joint Undertaking through the Project PRYSTINE","grantNumber":"783190"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011688","fundingName":"Project SECREDAS","grantNumber":"783119"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Ground Segmentation Algorithm for Sloped Terrain and Sparse LiDAR Point Cloud","sourcePdf":"access-jimenezbermejo-3115664-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090218S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548034","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548038,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9548038/hli-3115493-small.gif","p":["Hong Li received the B.S. degree from the Logistic Engineering College, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China, in 2015.

In this paper, based on the Lyapunov method and with the micro-grid impedance identification, an active damping adaptive control strategy is proposed to guarantee local asymptotic stability for an LCL inverter system. First, using the backstepping design and taking the state variable errors as new variables, an appropriate Lyapunov function is constructed, so that the asymptotic stability control law can be obtained. Then, with this asymptotic stability controller, taking the varying impedance into account, an adaptive controller is developed using the Lyapunov direct method. Hence, the controller presented here can assure asymptotic stability, the system performance can also be improved instantly according to the adaptive control, and the expected stability and performance can also be achieved. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control strategy was verified via a simulation and an experiment.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Asymptotic stability","Inverters","Damping","Backstepping","Lyapunov methods","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","damping","invertors","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","power grids","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active damping adaptive controller","grid-connected inverter","grid impedance","weak grid condition","Lyapunov method","microgrid impedance identification","active damping adaptive control strategy","local asymptotic stability","LCL inverter system","state variable errors","appropriate Lyapunov function","asymptotic stability control law","asymptotic stability controller","varying impedance","Lyapunov direct method","expected stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LCL grid-connected inverter","asymptotic stability","backstepping method","Lyapunov function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09548038.pdf","startPage":"132442","endPage":"132454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Damping Adaptive Controller for Grid-Connected Inverter Under Weak Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active Damping Adaptive Controller for Grid-Connected Inverter Under Weak Grid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548038/","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548038/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"21101908","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Fundation, Guangdong-Guangxi Cooperation Project","grantNumber":"2021B1515420006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100018602","fundingName":"Guangxi Innovation-Driven Development Project","grantNumber":"AA17202032-2"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61861003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Active Damping Adaptive Controller for Grid-Connected Inverter Under Weak Grid","sourcePdf":"access-li-3115493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089733S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548038","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548039,"authors":[{"name":"Gyeongho Kim","affiliation":["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9548039/kim-3115665-small.gif","p":["Gyeongho Kim received the B.S. degree in industrial engineering from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Republic of Korea, in 2021, where he is currently pursuing the combined M.S./Ph.D. degree in industrial engineering.

Hence the computation of eigenvalues, eigenmode shapes, participation factors, and coherency of generators are essential parameters of critical LFO modes. The existing data-driven approaches explore either one or two aspects of modal parameters from the dynamic pattern of the measurement data. In the present work, two approaches i) Iterative Approach(IA) ii) Non-Iterative Subspace(SS) method of data-driven techniques are used to estimate the state-space model of the system under study from the measurement data in a holistic framework. Based on the estimated system model, the eigenvalues of LFO, eigenmode shapes, participation factor, and coherency of associated generators participating in electromechanical oscillations are computed. Finally, from the estimated participation factors for the Inter-area oscillation mode (IAM), the Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) damping controller is designed and placed at the generator with the highest participation factor for damping of inter-area oscillation. The enhancement of damping ratio of inter area mode with STATCOM damping controller is estimated and verified using IA & SS data driven approaches for the first time. In this work, IA uses prediction-error minimization algorithm (PEM) & Parallel computing techniques and SS method uses Multivariable Output Error State Space (MOESP) algorithm for the estimation of Hankel matrix from the measured data. The effectiveness of data-driven approaches are demonstrated by the simulation of a IEEE 4-machine,10-bus power system using MATLAB/Simulink. IA & SS methods incorporating wavelet based denoising techniques are very effective in identifying the LFO modes even with noisy measurement. The efficacy of the denoising to suppress the effect of noise is demonstrated by comparing with noiseless environment. The results of data-driven approaches indicate their high degree of accuracy and efficiency in being consistent with Eigenvalue analysis (EA) performed on the system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Oscillators","Power system stability","Shape","Mathematical models","Damping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","iterative methods","power system control","power system measurement","power system stability","state-space methods","static VAr compensators","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalue analysis","data-driven techniques","low frequency oscillations","multimachine power system","eigenmode shapes","LFO modes","modal parameters","measurement data","state-space model","estimated system model","electromechanical oscillations","estimated participation factors","inter-area oscillation mode","damping ratio","STATCOM damping controller","prediction-error minimization algorithm","small signal stability","eigenvalue shapes","iterative approach","noniterative subspace method","static synchronous compensator damping controller","parallel computing techniques","multivariable output error state space algorithm","Hankel matrix","IEEE 4-machine power system","IEEE 10-bus power system","MATLAB-Simulink","IA and SS method","wavelet based denoising techniques","noisy measurement","noiseless environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eigenmodes","mode shapes","inter-area oscillations","swing mode","coherency of generators"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09548040.pdf","startPage":"133416","endPage":"133437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Data-Driven Techniques for Detection and Identification of Low Frequency Oscillations in Multimachine Power System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Data-Driven Techniques for Detection and Identification of Low Frequency Oscillations in Multimachine Power System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548040/","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548040/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"21103618","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Analysis of Data-Driven Techniques for Detection and Identification of Low Frequency Oscillations in Multimachine Power System","sourcePdf":"access-shetty-3115708-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132517S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548040","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548046,"authors":[{"name":"Cam Ly Nguyen","affiliation":["Wireless System Laboratory, Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9548046/nguye-3115596-small.gif","p":["Cam Ly Nguyen received the B.Sc. degree in computer science and engineering from Osaka University, in 2010, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from The University of Tokyo, in 2019.

One less understood aspect relates to the benefits of RIS towards wireless localization and positioning of mobile users and devices. In this paper we propose and demonstrate two practical solutions that exploit the diversity offered by RIS-enhanced indoor environments and to select RIS state configurations that generate easily differentiable radio maps for use with wireless fingerprinting localization estimators. Specifically, we first investigate supervised learning feature selection methods to prune the large state space of the RIS, thus reducing complexity and enhancing localization accuracy and device position acquisition time. We then analytically derive noise correlated heuristics that can further reduce the computational complexity of our proposed solution. Finally, we validate and benchmark our proposed solutions through accurate end-to-end models and computer simulations while demonstrating an average localization accuracy improvement of about 33%. Our explorations thus demonstrate how and why accuracy improvements are achieved and also hint towards how these can be further enhanced in practical localization settings while utilizing more than one RIS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09548046.pdf","startPage":"135526","endPage":"135541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Fingerprinting Localization in Smart Environments Using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Costs","Communication system security","Benchmark testing","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless localization","RIS","6G","RSSI","fingerprinting","feature selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Fingerprinting Localization in Smart Environments Using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9548046/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Vingroup Joint Stock Company (Vingroup JSC), Vingroup"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100015501","fundingName":"Vingroup Innovation Foundation","grantNumber":"VINIF.2020.DA09"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010665","fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Project eNergy nEutral Wireless SEnsor Networks (NEWSENs)","grantNumber":"787180"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010667","fundingName":"EU H2020 Reconfigurable Intelligent Sustainable Environments for 6G Wireless Networks (RISE-6G) Project","grantNumber":"101017011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society","grantNumber":"INF\\R2\\192066"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wireless Fingerprinting Localization in Smart Environments Using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces","sourcePdf":"access-georgiou-3115596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124421S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548046","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":9548052,"authors":[{"name":"Harim Lee","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9548052/lee-3113186-small.gif","p":["Harim Lee received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea, in 2013, the M.S. degree in IT convergence engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, South Korea, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, South Korea, in August 2020.

Instead of blurring or masking the face parts of the videos, we want to exquisitely modify only the face parts so that the people in the modified videos still look like humans, but they become anonymous. Doing so, the semantic information of the videos can be preserved even with the anonymization. Specifically, based on the latest generative adversarial network architecture, we propose a deep learning-based face-anonymization scheme so that each modified face part looks like the face of a person who does not actually exist. The trained face-anonymizer is then mounted on the UAV system we have implemented. Through experiments, we confirm that the developed privacy-preserving UAV system anonymizes UAV\u2019s first-person videos so that the people in the video are not recognized as anyone in the dataset used. In addition, we show that even with such anonymized videos, the perception performance required for performing UAV\u2019s essential functions such as simultaneous localization and mapping is not degraded.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113186","startPage":"132652","endPage":"132662","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09548052.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Privacy-Preserving UAV System With Deep Learning-Based Face Anonymization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Privacy-Preserving UAV System With Deep Learning-Based Face Anonymization","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9548052/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21101846","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548052/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014188","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program supervised by the Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP)","grantNumber":"IITP-2021-0-02048"},{"fundingName":"IITP Grant by the Korean Government (MSIP) (Development of Joint Electrical/Mechanical Drone Beamforming based on Target Detection and Precise Attitude Control)","grantNumber":"2018-0-00958"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003566","fundingName":"Project titled \u201cDevelopment of Technology for Impact Assessment and Management of HNS discharged from Marine Industrial Facilities,\u201d by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, South Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Development of a Privacy-Preserving UAV System With Deep Learning-Based Face Anonymization","sourcePdf":"access-yang-3113186-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149126S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548052","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548055,"authors":[{"name":"Weina Liu","affiliation":["College of Physical and Electric Information, Luoyang Normal University, Luoyang, China","College of Electric and Electrical Engineering, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/9594098/9548055/liu-3114707-small.gif","p":["Weina Liu received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 2013.

Several researches including concentration detection are promoted by measuring the minute dielectric property variations of samples. Highly sensitive and accurate device is required for measurement of electrolyte concentration in biological fluids, especially when measuring samples in nanoliter or less scale. In this paper, a miniaturized broadband coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission-line (TL) sensor with enhanced sensitivity is proposed. The sensitive device is realized by introducing interdigital capacitance (IDC) at the central conduction band of the CPW TL. The sensor is fabricated using print circuit board (PCB) technology with a microfluidic channel designed on it. A calibration based on microwave network theory is used to obtain the characteristic impedance and propagation constant of the sensing part. And accordingly, variations in magnitude and phase of S-parameters are employed to express the changes in concentration of the sample. Furthermore, an extracted equation between S-parameters and electrolyte concentration of the sample is first proposed. Experiments show the proposed sensor can detect the minimum concentration of 0.05 g/l for the three electrolytes (NaCl, KCl, and GaCl2 in deionized (DI) water)). Compared with a corrugator coplanar transmission line and a split ring resonator senor, the proposed sensor has a much higher sensitivity. Moreover, the device is robust in front of cross sensitivity caused by external factors (such as temperature variations, moisture, etc.). Thus, the proposed sensor is well suited for low-cost, real-tine, and CMOS compatibles sensing technologies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3114707","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2021.3114707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/9594098/09548055.pdf","startPage":"24066","endPage":"24074","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Coplanar waveguides","Transmission line measurements","Microfluidics","Sensitivity","Microwave circuits","Electrolytes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ionic concentration","microfluidics","microwave measurement","ion detection","CPW transmission line"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Transmission Line Sensor With Sensitivity Improved for Detection of Ionic Concentration in Microfluidic Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548055/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Transmission Line Sensor With Sensitivity Improved for Detection of Ionic Concentration in Microfluidic Channel","htmlLink":"/document/9548055/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2021","volume":"21","issue":"21","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801172"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Transmission Line Sensor With Sensitivity Improved for Detection of Ionic Concentration in Microfluidic Channel","sourcePdf":"jsen-liu-3114707-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098599S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"9594098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","xplore-issue":"9594098","articleId":"9548055","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548059,"authors":[{"name":"Yunsi Ma","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9548059/ma-3114873-small.gif","p":["Yunsi Ma (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2013, and the M.S. degree from China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, China, in 2016.

To mitigate the inherent ill-conditioning problem of MFTN signaling, we construct a segment-based frequency-domain received signal model in the form of a block circulant linear transition matrix, which can be efficiently calculated by applying a two dimensional fast Fourier transform. Based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the block circulant matrices, we can diagonalize the covariance matrix of the complex-valued colored noise process imposed by the associated two dimensional non-orthogonal matched filtering. Building on this model, a PBiGAMP-based parametric joint channel estimation and equalization (JCEE) algorithm is proposed for MFTN systems. In this algorithm, we introduce a pair of additive terms for characterizing the interferences arising from adjacent segments and employ the exact discrete \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n probabilities of the transmitted symbols for improving the bit error rate (BER) performance. To further enhance the system\u2019s robustness in the presence of ill-conditioned matrices, we develop a refined PBiGAMP-based JCEE algorithm by introducing a series of scaled identity matrices. Moreover, the proposed PBiGAMP-based JCEE algorithms may be readily decomposed into GAMP-based equalization algorithms, when the channel state information is perfectly known. The overall complexity of the proposed algorithms only increases logarithmically with the total number of transmitted symbols. Our simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed PBiGAMP-based iterative message passing receiver conceived for MFTN signaling.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114873","startPage":"8443","endPage":"8458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3114873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9653733/09548059.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric Bilinear Iterative Generalized Approximate Message Passing Reception of FTN Multi-Carrier Signaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548059/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parametric Bilinear Iterative Generalized Approximate Message Passing Reception of FTN Multi-Carrier Signaling","volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9548059/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"\u201cNational Science Foundation of China (NSFC)\u201d","grantNumber":"61971041 and 62001027"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council projects EP/P034284/1 and EP/P003990/1 (COALESCE) as well as the European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant QuantCom","grantNumber":"789028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric Bilinear Iterative Generalized Approximate Message Passing Reception of FTN Multi-Carrier Signaling","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-3114873-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077622S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9548059","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9548062,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Jing Wu","affiliation":["MOE Engineering Research Center of Smart Micro-Sensors and Microsystems, School of Electronics and Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/9594098/9548062/wu-3115570-small.gif","p":["Wen-Jing Wu received the B.E. degree from Ningbo University of Technology, Ningbo, China, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree from Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, in 2019.

To address these challenges, in this paper, a novel multicast framework that leverages the advantages of network-assisted dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP and cloud radio access networks is proposed, where a multicast assistant server is deployed at the edge of a mobile network. Under this architecture, a joint user grouping, version selection, and bandwidth allocation method is designed to optimize the sum of users\u2019 utilities. In particular, a two-step scheme is proposed to solve this complex problem. The number of multicast groups is first automatically determined and a user clustering method is presented. Then, group-level version selection and spectrum assignment algorithms are performed at different time scales.

In this paper, we propose a residual-attention offline handwritten Chinese text recognition based on fully convolutional neural networks, which is segmentation-free handwritten recognition that avoids the impact of incorrect character segmentation. By designing a smart residual attention gate block, our model can help to extract important features, and effectively implement the training of deep convolutional neural networks.

However, the delivery of truly immersive experiences requires the incorporation of other senses such as touch and smell. Multisensorial effects are usually manually synchronized with videos and data is stored in companion files, which contain timestamps for these effects. This manual task becomes very complex for 360\u00b0 videos, as the scenes triggering effects can occur in different viewpoints. The solution proposed in this paper aims to automatically add extra sensory information to immersive 360\u00b0 videos. A novel scent prediction scheme using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is proposed to perform scene predictions on 360\u00b0 videos represented in the Equi-Angular Cubemap format in order to add scents relevant to the detected content. Digital signal processing is used to detect loud sounds in the video with a Root Mean Square (RMS) function, which are then associated with haptic feedback. A prototype was developed, which outputs multisensorial stimuli by using an olfaction dispenser and a haptic mouse. The proposed solution has been tested and it achieved excellent results in terms of accuracy of scene detection, olfaction latency and correct execution of the relevant effects. Different CNN architectures, including AlexNet, ResNet18 and ResNet50, were also assessed comparatively, achieving a labeling accuracy of up to 72.67% for olfaction-enhanced media.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09548096.pdf","startPage":"133156","endPage":"133169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic CNN-Based Enhancement of 360\u00b0 Video Experience With Multisensorial Effects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Automatic CNN-Based Enhancement of 360\u00b0 Video Experience With Multisensorial Effects","htmlLink":"/document/9548096/","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010661","fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation program","grantNumber":"870610"},{"fundingName":"TRACTION Opera co-creation for a social transformation project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Research Centres Program via grants","grantNumber":"SFI/12/RC/2289_P2 (Insight) and SFI/16/SP/3804 (ENABLE)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund"},{"fundingName":"gratefully acknowledged"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Automatic CNN-Based Enhancement of 360\u00b0 Video Experience With Multisensorial Effects","sourcePdf":"access-simiscuka-3115701-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112683S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548096","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9548099,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas Mena-Oreja","affiliation":["Uwicore Laboratory, Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez de Elche (UMH), Elche, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9548099/menao-3115709-small.gif","p":["Jes\u00fas Mena-Oreja received the degree in industrial engineering from the Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez de Elche (UMH), Spain, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree, working on the use of machine learning and big data for traffic characterization and prediction under the presence of connected and automated vehicles.

The accuracy of traffic predictions depends on the availability of the data used for the prediction as well as the prediction model. Data from fixed traffic detectors is only available at certain locations. On the other hand, connected vehicles can provide Floating Car Data (FCD) at any location and time. However, FCD may not be available at all vehicles, and this can impact predictions since the FCD may not reflect the state of all traffic. This impact is larger when predicting traffic density or flow, and existing studies generally use FCD to predict traffic speed or travel time only. This study proposes a traffic prediction model that can accurately predict the three fundamental traffic variables (traffic density, flow, and speed) using FCD and an error recurrent convolutional neural network that takes as input the three variables. These are estimated using FCD and data from induction loops. These estimates depend on the penetration rate of FCD, so we propose a method to locally and dynamically estimate this penetration rate. This method improves the estimation of the traffic variables, and hence their prediction. The proposed model is used to analyze the impact of the FCD penetration rate on the prediction of the traffic variables. We show how our proposal reduces the amount of FCD needed to improve the prediction obtained with data from traffic detectors. We show that our proposal only requires FCD from 4% of the vehicles to improve the prediction accuracy achieved with traffic detectors. Augmenting this percentage increases the accuracy of our model for the three traffic variables. However, we also show that our prediction model reduces the FCD sample size (or FCD penetration rate) needed to achieve prediction accuracy levels close to that obtained if all vehicles provided FCD.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548099/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21103619","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Impact of Floating Car Data and Data Fusion on the Prediction of the Traffic Density, Flow and Speed Using an Error Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003359","fundingName":"Local Government of Valencia and co-supported by the European Social Fund","grantNumber":"ACIF/2017/160"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011729","fundingName":"Spanish Direcci\u00f3n General de Tr\u00e1fico","grantNumber":"SPIP2017-02204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004837","fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCI), the State Research Agency (AEI), and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)","grantNumber":"TEC2017-88612-R and PID2020-115576RB-I00"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the Impact of Floating Car Data and Data Fusion on the Prediction of the Traffic Density, Flow and Speed Using an Error Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-menaoreja-3115709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143428S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548099","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548103,"authors":[{"name":"Yoon Seok Yang","affiliation":["Intel Labs, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9548103/yang-3115671-small.gif","p":["Yoon Seok Yang (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, in 2012.

The experiment results reveal that our proposed iterative MIMO-LDPC-H.264 joint decoder achieved up to 66% energy reduction with only 0.09 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio degradation when compared to a non-UEP based joint source-channel decoding system.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09548103.pdf","startPage":"133062","endPage":"133075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power Cross-Layer Error Management Using MIMO-LDPC Iterative Decoding for Video Processing","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power Cross-Layer Error Management Using MIMO-LDPC Iterative Decoding for Video Processing","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9548103/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Korean Government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"NRF-2020R1A4A1019628"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2019R1I1A3A01061266"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Low-Power Cross-Layer Error Management Using MIMO-LDPC Iterative Decoding for Video Processing","sourcePdf":"access-kim-3115671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130547S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548103","onlineDate":"24 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":9548117,"authors":[{"name":"Vladyslav Hamolia","affiliation":["Lviv Polytechnic National University, Lviv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Vladyslav","lastName":"Hamolia","id":"37088980186"},{"name":"Viktor Melnyk","affiliation":["Lviv Polytechnic National University, Lviv, Ukraine","Institute of Mathematics, Informatics and Landscape Architecture, John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Melnyk","id":"38197207000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1854-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4820-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548117","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Machine Learning Methods and Applications in Electronic Design Automation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548117","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design automation","Reinforcement learning","Tools","Predictive models","Routing","Software","Space exploration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA design","Machine Learning","Deep Learning"]}],"abstract":"Over the past decades, the domain of electronic circuits design continues transitioning to wider usage of the automation tools to overcome the human level limitations, where integrated circuits (IC) were designed by hand and manually arranged. Experts in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry agree that most of the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) designers will turn to high-level automated design methodologies soon. The main reason for this is the technology improvements that have taken place in the EDA tools, hardware, and software. In the past couple of years, Machine Learning (ML) achievements for EDA turned into a separate field with new studies and methods that enclose all the phases in the chip design flow, such as logic synthesis, design space reduction, exploration, placement, and routing. The latest ML-build approaches have shown considerable improvements in contrast to established traditional methods.

However, estimating the state of health of lithium-ion batteries is a challenge due to the complex and nonlinear characteristics of battery degradation during its lifetime. To this end, data-driven techniques are becoming a more attractive promising approach to provide accurate state of health estimation of the lithium-ion battery because of their simplicity and ability to cope with the nonlinearity dynamic behaviour of the lithium-ion battery. Therefore, this paper compares the performance of three data-driven algorithms: the nonlinear autoregressive neural network, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory network in the state of health estimation. The performance of the proposed algorithms is analysed by using 16 lithium-ion cells cycled under various operating conditions from the NASA Ames Research center. The comparison results demonstrate that the long short-term memory network outperforms the other two methods with a maximum root mean square error of 0.50% and mean absolute error of 0.36%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lithium-ion batteries","Training","Protocols","Heuristic algorithms","NASA","Estimation","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","lithium compounds","mean square error methods","neural nets","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["root mean square error","NASA Ames research center","state of health estimation","long short-term memory network","convolutional neural network","nonlinear autoregressive neural network","nonlinearity dynamic behaviour","nonlinear characteristics","lithium-ion batteries","data-driven techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lithium-ion battery","state of health estimation","degradation","data-driven techniques","capacity estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/UPEC50034.2021.9548209","publicationTitle":"2021 56th International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 56th International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548148/9548149/09548209.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC50034.2021.9548209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State of Health Estimation of Lithium-ion Batteries Based on Data-Driven Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"State of Health Estimation of Lithium-ion Batteries Based on Data-Driven Techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548209/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"31 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548209/","accessionNumber":"21224754","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2021-Sept. 3 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State of Health Estimation of Lithium-ion Batteries Based on Data-Driven Techniques","confLoc":"Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570731736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063107S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548148","isNumber":"9548149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548148","xplore-issue":"9548149","articleId":"9548209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548211,"authors":[{"name":"Kellie Cowan","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Kellie","lastName":"Cowan","id":"37088979816"},{"name":"Xueqin Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Xueqin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406557500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4389-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4390-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548211","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548211","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature distribution","Clouds","Predictive models","Power system stability","Mathematical models","Data models","Forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid power systems","load forecasting","mean square error methods","photovoltaic power systems","power system stability","regression analysis","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data driven solar forecasting model","Northern Ireland","power system operator","network stability problem","system inertia","ample research","wind generation","accurate forecast methodologies","photovoltaic forecasting model","PV generation data","average root mean square error","multiple linear regression","system demand data","MAE","power 11.9 MW","power 7.7 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power","solar forecasting","PV generation"]}],"abstract":"Solar forecasting is an increasing problem for power system operators due to its variability from day to day. This inconsistent power generation effects not only load forecasting, but can cause increased network stability problems due to changing system inertia. Ample research has been carried out surrounding wind generation, with several accurate forecast methodologies created and used across the world. However, as the solar industry is only now beginning to take off in Northern Ireland (NI), with its capacity increasing exponentially every year, forecasting methods have not yet been accurately implemented by the System Operator for Northern Ireland (SONI). This report documents the creation of a NI specific photovoltaic (PV) forecasting model, based on meteorological and historic PV generation data, from data collection to testing. It was found that partial least squares out-performed multiple linear regression and therefore was used as the forecast base. A large scale model was created, achieving an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 11.9MW and MAE of 7.7MW. The forecast also improved accuracy with the addition of temperature, wind speed and cloud cover data. A small scale forecast was also built and up-scaled to its representative capacity on the NI system. The model was tested using NI System Demand data, achieving positive results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC50034.2021.9548211","publicationTitle":"2021 56th International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 56th International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548148/9548149/09548211.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/UPEC50034.2021.9548211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Driven Solar Forecasting Model for Northern Ireland","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2021-Sept. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"Data Driven Solar Forecasting Model for Northern Ireland","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548211/","publicationDate":"31 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21159632","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548211/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Driven Solar Forecasting Model for Northern Ireland","confLoc":"Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570727567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04243S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548148","isNumber":"9548149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548148","xplore-issue":"9548149","articleId":"9548211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548259,"authors":[{"name":"Zoltan Mark Pinter","affiliation":["Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, DK"],"firstName":"Zoltan Mark","lastName":"Pinter","id":"37088977546"},{"name":"Dimitrios Papageorgiou","affiliation":["Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, DK"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Papageorgiou","id":"37085624249"},{"name":"Gunnar Rohde","affiliation":["Danish Center for Energy Storage, Copenhagen, DK"],"firstName":"Gunnar","lastName":"Rohde","id":"37088516820"},{"name":"Mattia Marinelli","affiliation":["Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, DK"],"firstName":"Mattia","lastName":"Marinelli","id":"38288274500"},{"name":"Chresten Tr\u00e6holt","affiliation":["Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, DK"],"firstName":"Chresten","lastName":"Tr\u00e6holt","id":"37086902674"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4389-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4390-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548259","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548259","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power engineering","Control design","Heuristic algorithms","Reinforcement learning","Prediction algorithms","Batteries","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery management systems","battery storage plants","power generation control","reviews","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control algorithms","reconfigurable battery systems","battery cells","battery energy storage systems","review","BESS","battery management systems","BMS","circuit switching logic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Battery management systems","charge equalization","active balancing","reconfiguration","control strategy"]}],"abstract":"Battery cells within battery energy storage systems (BESS) do not have homogeneous attributes, and the lowest capacity ones limit the performance and lifetime of the whole pack. Modern battery management systems (BMS) solve this problem with balancing, while providing the required service, and safe operation to the user. Reconfigurable battery systems (RBS) are BESSs that involve a BMS with reconfiguration. Reconfiguration uses feedback to determine the circuit switching logic. This paper presents a structured review of the control algorithms for RBSs. The RBSs are divided into groups according to their control strategies and control implementations. Finding the adequate control strategy requires well-defined objectives and control design. The control implementation focuses on physical and architectural aspects, like the reconfiguration frequency, the balancing operation and the control topology. The considerations and categories are discussed with the advantages, disadvantages and academic examples, and then an innovative industrial BMS is introduced.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC50034.2021.9548259","publicationTitle":"2021 56th International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 56th International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548148/9548149/09548259.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/UPEC50034.2021.9548259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review of Control Algorithms for Reconfigurable Battery Systems with an Industrial Example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2021-Sept. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"Review of Control Algorithms for Reconfigurable Battery Systems with an Industrial Example","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548259/","publicationDate":"31 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21159646","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548259/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of Control Algorithms for Reconfigurable Battery Systems with an Industrial Example","confLoc":"Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570734916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093893S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2021-Sept. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548148","isNumber":"9548149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548148","xplore-issue":"9548149","articleId":"9548259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548280,"authors":[{"name":"Siqi Zhang","affiliation":["Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China","Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Complex Intelligent System and Integration, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9548280/zhang-3115586-small.gif","p":["Siqi Zhang was born in 1996.

Short-term few-channel EEG (e.g., in real-time detection of stress level and motor imagery) brings new challenges for removing artifacts due to less data. The existing artifact removal methods cannot guarantee both effectiveness and efficiency for removing artifacts from short-term few-channel EEG recordings. Consequently, we propose a fast adaptive sub-bands\u2019 blind source separation method to remove artifacts from short-term few-channel EEG recordings effectively and efficiently. First, noise-assisted fast multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-FMEMD), as a fast adaptive multidimensional sub-bands\u2019 decomposition method, is used to decompose short-term few-channel EEG recordings into multidimensional sub-bands. Then canonical correlation analysis (CCA), as a blind source separation method, is used to estimate artifact-related and EEG-related sources. Finally, EEG-related sources are intelligently selected and reconstructed as clean EEG recordings. The results demonstrate that our method takes at least five times less computing time for 2-s few-channel EEG recordings than state-of-the-art methods with similar effectiveness, using the same computer and software. Therefore, our method enhances the efficiency of removing artifacts from short-term few-channel EEG recordings while ensuring effectiveness, and it is more suitable for real-time processing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","externalId":"4007516","htmlLink":"/document/9548280/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Rejection of Artifacts for Short-Term Few-Channel EEG Based on Fast Adaptive Multidimensional Sub-Bands Blind Source Separation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801476 and 61971413"},{"fundingName":"Jinan Innovation Team","grantNumber":"2018GXRC017"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Key Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"BE2021012-5"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Rejection of Artifacts for Short-Term Few-Channel EEG Based on Fast Adaptive Multidimensional Sub-Bands Blind Source Separation","sourcePdf":"tim-liu-3115586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109216S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9548280","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9548285,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Czarnocki","affiliation":["Faculty of Law, Center for IT & IP Law KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Czarnocki","id":"37088976523"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2693-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2694-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1617-5468"}],"articleNumber":"9548285","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emotion recognition","Biometrics (access control)","Data processing","Regulation","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","biometrics (access control)","data protection","emotion recognition","law"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GDPR","biometric systems","emotion recognition system","technically biometric data","biometric data processing","AI Act-based assessment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["biometric data","emotion recognition","AI Act","AI","data protection","privacy","biometrics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548285","abstract":"The paper explains how the definition of biometric data copied from the GDPR may hamper the regulation of emotion recognition\u2014as defined in the proposed AI Act. A replicated definition of biometric data is suitable for biometric systems, but not emotion recognition technologies. It is because, under the proposed AI Act, an emotion recognition system is understood as such if it processes biometric data\u2014as defined in the GDPR. But the definition from the GDPR does not encompass all biometric data, which are technically biometric data and are processed in the emotion recognition systems. Also, in the proposed AI Act the definition of emotion recognition does not recognize emotion recognition systems not relying on biometric data processing. That is why the obligation in the proposed AI Act for users to inform natural persons about their exposure to the emotion recognition system is unapplicable in the majority of cases. The flawed definition may also put at risk the proposed AI Act-based assessment of whether AI systems should be prohibited. Therefore, a new definition of emotion recognition and biometric data is needed.","doi":"10.1109/BIOSIG52210.2021.9548285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOSIG52210.2021.9548285","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9547357/9548283/09548285.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Will new definitions of emotion recognition and biometric data hamper the objectives of the proposed AI Act?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Will new definitions of emotion recognition and biometric data hamper the objectives of the proposed AI Act?","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9548285/","accessionNumber":"21142320","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548285/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Will new definitions of emotion recognition and biometric data hamper the objectives of the proposed AI Act?","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"0232021003655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054442S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9547357","isNumber":"9548283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9547357","xplore-issue":"9548283","articleId":"9548285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548292,"authors":[{"name":"DeWayne Halfen","affiliation":["Booz Allen Hamilton, Arlington, VA"],"firstName":"DeWayne","lastName":"Halfen","id":"37088975820"},{"name":"Srinivasan Rajaraman","affiliation":["Booz Allen Hamilton, Laurel, MD"],"firstName":"Srinivasan","lastName":"Rajaraman","id":"37088887332"},{"name":"James L.

Models for estimating and expressing system error rates (both false matches and false non-matches) have been largely limited to so-called \"1-to-1\" and \"1-to-N\" systems in which each identity is represented by only one enrolled reference [3]. In this paper, we create a highly simplified simulation model for a common current situation in which each known identity record has multiple stored references. We call this the \"1:M:N\" model and show that both DET and CMC performance depend upon the number of identities and references per identity, not simply the total number of reference images, as usually assumed. Although trialed here on very simple decision policies, this model will be extended in future work to more complex decision criteria.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOSIG52210.2021.9548292","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9547357/9548283/09548292.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/BIOSIG52210.2021.9548292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biometric Recognition in a Multi-Sample Multi-Subject Facial Image Database: The 1:M:N System Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Biometric Recognition in a Multi-Sample Multi-Subject Facial Image Database: The 1:M:N System Model","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548292/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","accessionNumber":"21142310","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548292/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biometric Recognition in a Multi-Sample Multi-Subject Facial Image Database: The 1:M:N System Model","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"0282021003726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044045S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9547357","isNumber":"9548283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9547357","xplore-issue":"9548283","articleId":"9548292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548296,"authors":[{"name":"Labib Chowdhury","affiliation":["North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Labib","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37088758408"},{"name":"Mustafa Kamal","affiliation":["North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Kamal","id":"37088976234"},{"name":"Najia Hasan","affiliation":["North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Najia","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37088976845"},{"name":"Nabeel Mohammed","affiliation":["North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Nabeel","lastName":"Mohammed","id":"37085694082"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2693-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2694-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1617-5468"}],"articleNumber":"9548296","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548296","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Protocols","Error analysis","Biological system modeling","Face recognition","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","computer aided instruction","deep learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard training samples","leveraging angular margin-based losses","face recognition","curriculum learning-based techniques","inter-class margins","CL-SincNet","curricular loss function","inter-dataset evaluation protocols","inter-dataset testing","Curricular SincNet","robust deep speaker recognition","deep learning models","biometric recognition systems","deep neural network architecture","parameterized sinc functions","speech signal","original SincNet architecture","softmax loss","recognition-based tasks","easy training samples"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometric Authentication","Speaker Recognition","Angular Margin Loss","Curriculum Learning"]}],"abstract":"Deep learning models have become an increasingly preferred option for biometric recognition systems, such as speaker recognition. SincNet, a deep neural network architecture, gained popularity in speaker recognition tasks due to its parameterized sinc functions that allow it to work directly on the speech signal. The original SincNet architecture uses the softmax loss, which may not be the most suitable choice for recognition-based tasks. Such loss functions do not impose inter-class margins nor differentiate between easy and hard training samples. Curriculum learning, particularly those leveraging angular margin-based losses, has proven very successful in other biometric applications such as face recognition. The advantage of such a curriculum learning-based techniques is that it will impose inter-class margins as well as taking to account easy and hard samples. In this paper, we propose Curricular SincNet(CL-SincNet), an improved SincNet model where we use a curricular loss function to train the SincNet architecture. The proposed model is evaluated on multiple datasets using intra-dataset and inter-dataset evaluation protocols. In both settings, the model performs competitively with other previously published work. In the case of inter-dataset testing, it achieves the best overall results with a reduction of 4% error rate compare to SincNet and other published work.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOSIG52210.2021.9548296","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9547357/9548283/09548296.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/BIOSIG52210.2021.9548296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Curricular SincNet: Towards Robust Deep Speaker Recognition by Emphasizing Hard Samples in Latent Space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Curricular SincNet: Towards Robust Deep Speaker Recognition by Emphasizing Hard Samples in Latent Space","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548296/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","accessionNumber":"21159367","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548296/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Curricular SincNet: Towards Robust Deep Speaker Recognition by Emphasizing Hard Samples in Latent Space","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"0112021003526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055435S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9547357","isNumber":"9548283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9547357","xplore-issue":"9548283","articleId":"9548296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548327,"authors":[{"name":"Charitha Madapatha","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8782661/9309127/9548327/madap-3114669-small.gif","p":["Charitha Madapatha (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from the Asian Institute of Technology, Pathumthani, Thailand, in 2016, the M.Sc. degree in communication engineering from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2020, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in communication systems and information theory.","He was also involved in LTE network planning and optimization in Thailand and Cambodia.

We develop efficient genetic algorithm-based schemes for both IAB node placement and non-IAB backhaul link distribution, and evaluate the effect of routing on bypassing temporal blockages. Here, concentrating on millimeter wave-based communications, we study the service coverage probability, defined as the probability of the event that the user equipments\u2019 (UEs) minimum rate requirements are satisfied. Moreover, we study the effect of different parameters such as the antenna gain, blockage, and tree foliage on the system performance. Finally, we summarize the recent Rel-16 as well as the upcoming Rel-17 3GPP discussions on routing in IAB networks, and discuss the main challenges for enabling mesh-based IAB networks. As we show, with a proper network topology, IAB is an attractive approach to enable the network densification required by 5G and beyond.","doi":"10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3114669","startPage":"2273","endPage":"2291","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782661/9309127/09548327.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3114669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9309127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Topology Optimization and Routing in Integrated Access and Backhaul Networks: A Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Wireless communication","Optimization","Network topology","3GPP","Topology","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","genetic algorithms","millimetre wave communication","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["topology optimization","integrated access","backhaul networks","genetic algorithm-based approach","efficient genetic algorithm-based schemes","temporal blockages","millimeter wave-based communications","service coverage probability","minimum rate requirements","upcoming Rel-17 3GPP discussions","mesh-based IAB networks","proper network topology","network densification","non-IAB backhaul link distribution","evolving 5G networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated access and backhaul","IAB","genetic algorithm","node selection","topology optimization","densification","millimeter wave","(mmWave) communications","3GPP","stochastic geometry","poisson point process","coverage probability","germ-grain model","wireless backhaul","5G NR","blockage","relay","routing","tree foliage","machine learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548327/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"On Topology Optimization and Routing in Integrated Access and Backhaul Networks: A Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach","volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9548327/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21126515","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001858","fundingName":"VINNOVA (Swedish Government Agency for Innovation Systems) within the VINN Excellence Center ChaseOn"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission through the H2020 Project Hexa-X","grantNumber":"101015956"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On Topology Optimization and Routing in Integrated Access and Backhaul Networks: A Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"ojcoms-madapatha-3114669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169797S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782661","isNumber":"9309127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782661","xplore-issue":"9309127","articleId":"9548327","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9548328,"authors":[{"name":"Waqar Tanveer","affiliation":["Air University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Waqar","lastName":"Tanveer","id":"37088979462"},{"name":"Muhammad Habib Mahmood","affiliation":["Air University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Habib Mahmood","id":"37086457846"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3603-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1162-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548328","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Training","Technological innovation","Supervised learning","Training data","Semisupervised learning","Generative adversarial networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning (artificial intelligence)","image annotation","image recognition","image sequences","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature learning process","completely unsupervised process","unsupervised person reidentification","Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network","supervised learning","person reidentification problem","training data","GAN","CMC curve","cumulative match characteristic curve","pairwise manually annotated data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Person Re-Identification","Unsupervised Learning","DCGAN","Feature Extraction","Similarity Measures"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548328","abstract":"Most of the researchers are targeting the problem of person re-identification with supervised learning.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for the person re-identification problem based on utilization of Generative Adversarial Network. We use Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network for feature learning from image sequences of datasets as we prove that GANs learn the features effectively. In the feature learning process, we do not use any labels so this is a completely unsupervised process. Several similarity measures and a Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) Curve are used for the evaluation of our results.

In addition to traditional image processing methods, deep learning networks are also frequently used in object detection in wide area images. Although vehicle detection methods in WAS provide high accuracy, they also involve significant computational complexity and require hardware with intensive processing power. In this study, a low complexity and high accuracy hybrid vehicle detection method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with support of morphological operations is presented. Results on the COWC dataset show that the proposed architecture can detect vehicles with precision of 96% even though the number of neural network parameters is just above a hundred thousands. A comparison on number of parameters with respect to commonly used neural networks reveal that the proposed architecture uses significantly lower number of parameters. Performance evaluation and the comparison of the proposed method with YOLO-v4 show the success of the presented miniature CNN network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imaginary using a Miniature CNN Architecture","doi":"10.1109/INISTA52262.2021.9548348","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INISTA52262.2021.9548348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548115","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548323/9548115/09548348.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imaginary using a Miniature CNN Architecture","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9548348/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","publicationDate":"25 Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imaginary using a Miniature CNN Architecture","confLoc":"Kocaeli, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.168099S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548323","isNumber":"9548115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548323","xplore-issue":"9548115","articleId":"9548348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9548351,"authors":[{"name":"Ercan Av\u015far","affiliation":["Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ercan","lastName":"Av\u015far","id":"37085470634"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3603-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1162-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548351","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Adaptation models","Technological innovation","Wiener filters","Pulmonary diseases","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnostic radiography","diseases","feature extraction","filtering theory","image classification","image enhancement","image texture","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MobileNetV2 model","Wiener filtering operation","corresponding classification results","preprocessing steps","different convolutional neural network architectures","involved preprocessing methods","unsharp masking","deep learning models","pneumonia detection performance","image preprocessing methods","high death rate","X-Ray images","convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["classification","convolutional neural networks","deep learning","preprocessing","pneumonia"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548351","abstract":"Pneumonia is an infection that is typically diagnosed by taking X-Ray images of chest of the subject and it has a very high death rate in children.

Arousals cause sleep deprivation by fragmenting sleep, and ultimately, many health problems. Arousals can be induced by well-studied apneas and hypopneas or other sleep orders such as hypoventilation, bruxism, respiratory effort-related arousals. Thus, detection of less-studied non-apnea/hypopnea arousals is important for diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Traditionally, polysomnography (PSG) test that is recording and inspecting overnight physiological signals is used for sleep studies. In this work, a novel method based on one dimensional local binary pattern (1D-LBP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic arousal detection from polysomnography recordings is proposed. 25 recordings from PhysioNet Challenge 2018 PSG dataset are used for experiments. Each signal in PSG recordings is transformed to a new signal using 1D-LBP, and then segmented using 10-s-long sliding window.

Over time, faults may occur in bearings due to variable operating speeds and loads, contamination, etc., and this may cause a severe reduction in performance. In the future, an undetected bearing fault can lead to a fatal breakdown and substantial economic losses or even human casualties. Thus, bearing early fault diagnosis emerges as a critical and up-to-date topic. It is possible to obtain vibration, acoustic, motor current, etc., data that contain crucial diagnostics information regarding the health conditions of mechanical systems with various sensor technologies. With the era of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have started to be utilized frequently in industrial applications. In this regard, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are increasingly popular with their capability to capture fault information without expert knowledge. This paper deals with a bearing fault diagnosis method based on one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN) using vibration data. A multi-class classification problem was solved by examining different operating conditions for three health classes. Therefore, healthy state, inner raceway, and outer raceway faults were detected under variable operating speeds (900 and 1500 rpm) and loads (0.1 and 0.7 Nm). The effectiveness of the proposed 1D CNN method was evaluated with the Paderborn University (PU) dataset. As a result, rolling bearing early fault diagnosis was performed with an accuracy of 93.97%. It was observed that the proposed method was suitable for bearing fault diagnosis and can be utilized to optimize the rotary machinery maintenance costs by early fault detection.","doi":"10.1109/INISTA52262.2021.9548378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INISTA52262.2021.9548378","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548323/9548115/09548378.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional Neural Networks Based Rolling Bearing Fault Classification Under Variable Operating Conditions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548378/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","publicationDate":"25 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional Neural Networks Based Rolling Bearing Fault Classification Under Variable Operating Conditions","confLoc":"Kocaeli, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135881S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548323","isNumber":"9548115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548323","xplore-issue":"9548115","articleId":"9548378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9548402,"authors":[{"name":"Nevena Rankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Chair of Computer Science, School of Computing Union University, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Nevena","lastName":"Rankovi\u0107","id":"37088701296"},{"name":"Dragica Rankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Chair of Mathematics, School of Computing Union University, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Dragica","lastName":"Rankovi\u0107","id":"37088697753"},{"name":"Mirjana Ivanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Mirjana","lastName":"Ivanovi\u0107","id":"37666726400"},{"name":"Ljubomir Lazi\u0107","affiliation":["Chair of Computer Engineering, School of Computing Union University, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Ljubomir","lastName":"Lazi\u0107","id":"38548490800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3603-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1162-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548402","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Correlation","Estimation","Artificial neural networks","Computer architecture","Predictive models","Tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","DP industry","fuzzy set theory","neural net architecture","pattern clustering","project management","software cost estimation","software development management","Taguchi methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monitoring prediction","MMRE","ANN","project values","mean magnitude relative error","Kemerer15","NASA60","COCOMO2000","fuzzification","clustering","Taguchi's orthogonal vector plan","software industry","artificial intelligence tools","software project development","software projects efforts estimation","orthogonal arrays","artificial neural network architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["software estimation","artificial neural network design","Taguchi orthogonal array","clustering","fuzzification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548402","abstract":"Accurate assessment of software project development using the proper artificial intelligence tools can be a significant challenge for success in the software industry.

Modern SoCs with integrated FPGAs have low-power on-chip processors and sufficient interfaces to accommodate the most commonly deployed Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, developing DNN hardware accelerators using integrated FPGAs remains a complicated task due to the complexity of reconfigurable computing and limited hardware resources on embedded devices. In addition, it is necessary to master High-Level Synthesis tools (HLS) and their hidden philosophy driving RTL design. This paper presents our Python framework to fully customize and automate the generation and deployment of FPGA-based DNN topologies for Edge Computing. Our framework environment, Jupyter Notebooks, allows users to customize their desired hardware DNN and its related applications on Xilinx\u2019s Pynq boards. Subsequently, the framework automatically generates TCL (Tool Command Language) scripts driving HLS tools on the host server or cloud. Once the desired FPGA-based architecture is generated, the framework retrieves the bitstream to configure the FPGA. Therefore, the user can deploy this bitstream to accelerate any Python application that performs the same DNN model.

When we consider the quadrotor and load pair, there are two cases: the quadrotor carries the load, and the load is on the ground. Since the dynamics of the system are different for these two cases, they must be considered separately. Therefore, a different PID controller is designed for each case. The necessary mechanism has been created to ensure that the transitions between these two controllers are smooth. The controller coefficients are adjusted so that the swing angles of the load are minimal. IMU has been added to the load-bearing mechanism to find out what angle the load is. Also, images of the load have been obtained with the camera located under the quadrotor. The swing angles have been calculated according to the position of the load in the image. Although our physical system studies continue, both the IMU and camera models have been created and integrated into the quadrotor-slung load model. PID coefficients have been obtained using the Particle Swarm Optimization method. Tests have been carried out on different flight profiles and the results obtained are presented.","doi":"10.1109/INISTA52262.2021.9548550","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548323/9548115/09548550.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INISTA52262.2021.9548550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controller Design for Quadrotor-Slung Load System with Swing Angle Constraints Using Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Controller Design for Quadrotor-Slung Load System with Swing Angle Constraints Using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","accessionNumber":"21159920","publicationDate":"25 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548550/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controller Design for Quadrotor-Slung Load System with Swing Angle Constraints Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Kocaeli, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071543S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548323","isNumber":"9548115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548323","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9548115","articleId":"9548550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9548573,"authors":[{"name":"Burak Ta\u011ftekin","affiliation":["Huawei Turkey R&D Center, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Burak","lastName":"Ta\u011ftekin","id":"37088980428"},{"name":"Berkan H\u00f6ke","affiliation":["Huawei Turkey R&D Center, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Berkan","lastName":"H\u00f6ke","id":"37088980009"},{"name":"Mert Kutay Sezer","affiliation":["Huawei Turkey R&D Center, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mert Kutay","lastName":"Sezer","id":"37088978835"},{"name":"Mahiye Uluya\u011fmur \u00d6zt\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Huawei Turkey R&D Center, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mahiye Uluya\u011fmur","lastName":"\u00d6zt\u00fcrk","id":"37086167463"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3603-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1162-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548573","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Program processors","Embedded systems","Turning","Time factors","Intelligent systems","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","genetic algorithms","iterative methods","optimising compilers","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FOGA","program autotuning","embedded systems","compiler optimization space","renewed compiler options","autotuning solution","GCC flag optimization","autotuning approaches","OpenTuner framework","flag optimization with genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compiler optimization","Compiler flags","Autotuning","Optimization","Genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548573","abstract":"Recently, program autotuning has become very popular especially in embedded systems, when we have limited resources such as computing power and memory where these systems run generally time-critical applications.

Its detection is one of the fundamental tasks of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It consists of identifying the degree of semantic similarity between sentences that convey the same meaning with different words. Although many researchers focused on this task on the English language, there are few works for other languages like the Arabic. It has presented important challenges because of its richness of features and processing complexities. Nowadays, deep neural networks have yielded immense success in most NLP applications. In this paper, a Siamese architecture is proposed for Arabic paraphrase detection. It has proven its relevance for semantic textual similarity.

In this study, seven CNN architectures with different convolutional layers and dense layers were applied to the Brain Tumor Progression dataset. The CNN architectures are designed by gradually decreasing and increasing the layers, and the performance results on the considered dataset have been analyzed using five-fold cross-validation. The results showed that deeper architectures in binary classification tasks could reduce the performance rates up to 7%. It has been observed that models with the lowest number of layers are more successful in sensitivity results. General results demonstrated that networks with two convolutional and fully connected layers produced superior results depending on the filter and neuron number adjustments within their layers.

The use of chest radiography images in the diagnostic researches of COVID-19 is at the focus of artificial intelligence studies because of high-speed and worthwhile image acquisition. Image preprocessing methods aim to improve the classification accuracy of the models by providing more robust input images. Discrete Cosine Transform is an image compression technique and can be applied as a preprocessing method for classification problems. The reduction of the number of irrelevant pixels within the image during the compression process provides a more efficient and informative feature extraction from the images. This study presents the investigation of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and a deep convolutional neural network implementation on COVID-19 research using x-ray images. Two different datasets containing COVID-19 X-ray images were considered, and various experiments were performed by applying DCT on these images. The preliminary results of the two datasets showed that the implementation of DCT in the preprocessing phase of deep convolutional neural networks could increase the classification rates up to 10% and 5% in terms of \u03bcSensitivity and \u03bcROC AUC score, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Discrete Cosine Transform on COVID-19 Differentiation from Chest X-Ray Images: A Preliminary Study","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","doi":"10.1109/INISTA52262.2021.9548637","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548323/9548115/09548637.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INISTA52262.2021.9548637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Discrete Cosine Transform on COVID-19 Differentiation from Chest X-Ray Images: A Preliminary Study","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9548637/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","publicationDate":"25 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Discrete Cosine Transform on COVID-19 Differentiation from Chest X-Ray Images: A Preliminary Study","confLoc":"Kocaeli, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095204S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548323","isNumber":"9548115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548323","xplore-issue":"9548115","articleId":"9548637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9548650,"authors":[{"name":"Masum Shah Junayed","affiliation":["Bahcesehir University, Istanbul, Turkey","Daffodil Int.

In SCRAS, the transportation of the radio astronomical observation (RAO) data from the space to the ground stations is an important problem, for which \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[1]</xref>\n proposed a linear programming optimization based algorithm. However, the computational complexity of this algorithm is quite high which is exacerbated by the need to re-compute the algorithm frequently due to the time-varying characteristics of the observing satellites, the Earth stations, and the RAO region. In this paper, to address this high complexity issue, we develop a low-complexity RAO data transport algorithm. In addition to the static resource constraint scenario considered in the existing work, we introduce a dynamic resource constraint scenario to exploit the knowledge of the satellite communication system (SCS) traffic statistics. We also present a modified version of the algorithm in \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[1]</xref>\n for the dynamic resource constraint scenario. In addition to the number of inter-satellite link (ISL) hops as the RAO data transport cost metric, we also evaluate the metric of the sum of the squared ISL hop distances which reflects the transmission energy cost. Furthermore, computational complexity analysis and data transport costs of the algorithms are presented. Our results show that the proposed algorithm yields several orders of computational complexity saving over the existing method while incurring a modest increase in the data transport cost. Our proposed dynamic resource constraint scenario provides plausible reduction of the RAO data transport cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9548669/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Algorithm for Radio Astronomy Observation Data Transport in an Integrated NGSO Satellite Communication and Radio Astronomy System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1907614"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Low-Complexity Algorithm for Radio Astronomy Observation Data Transport in an Integrated NGSO Satellite Communication and Radio Astronomy System","sourcePdf":"ojcoms-mohamed-3115720-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142744S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782661","isNumber":"9309127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782661","xplore-issue":"9309127","articleId":"9548669","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9548673,"authors":[{"name":"Yanki Aslan","affiliation":["Microwave Sensing, Signals, and Systems Section, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9171629/9562119/9548673/aslan-3109244-small.gif","p":["Yanki Aslan (Member, IEEE) was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1991.

Different from the one-stage sequential change diagnosis problem considered in the existing work, after a change has been detected, we can continue to collect low-cost samples so that the post-change distribution can be identified more accurately. The goal of a two-stage SCD rule is to minimize the total cost including delay, false alarm probability, and misdiagnosis probability. To solve the two-stage SCD problem, we first convert the problem into a two-ordered optimal stopping time problem. Using tools from optimal multiple stopping time theory, we obtain the optimal SCD rule. Moreover, to address the high computational complexity issue of the optimal SCD rule, we further propose a computationally efficient threshold-based two-stage SCD rule. By analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of the delay, false alarm, and misdiagnosis costs, we show that the proposed threshold SCD rule is asymptotically optimal as the per-unit delay costs go to zero.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548746/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Bayesian Sequential Change Diagnosis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1711468, CCF-1717943, CNS-1824553 and ECCS-2000415"},{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1800800"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Outstanding Talents Training Fund","grantNumber":"202002"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Research","grantNumber":"2017ZT07X152 and 2019CX01X104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Bayesian Sequential Change Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tsp-lai-3115426-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11446S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9548746","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":9548750,"authors":[{"name":"Juinn-Horng Deng","affiliation":["Yuan Ze University, Chung-Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Juinn-Horng","lastName":"Deng","id":"37406883600"},{"name":"Chuan-Yi Liu","affiliation":["Yuan Ze University, Chung-Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuan-Yi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088977863"},{"name":"Cun-Jhe Liu","affiliation":["Yuan Ze University, Chung-Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cun-Jhe","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088977868"},{"name":"Meng-Lin Ku","affiliation":["National Central University, Chung-Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Lin","lastName":"Ku","id":"37602473400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0120-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0121-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548750","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Simulation","Instruments","Nonlinear distortion","Millimeter wave technology","Power amplifiers","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","distortion","millimetre wave amplifiers","power amplifiers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital pre-distortion techniques","mmWave OTA","multiple nonlinear power amplifiers","millimeter-wave frequency band","5th generation wireless systems","rapid attenuation","multiple millimeter-wave power amplifiers","power amplification","transmission range","nonlinear effect","increased input power","transmitted signal","digital pre-distortion technology","DPD compensation","nonlinear problem","signal distortion","mmWave over-the-air nonlinear PA","indirect-learning based DPD technology","spectrum efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["millimeter-wave","multiple power amplifiers","over-the-air","digital pre-distortion","nonlinearity","indirect learning architecture","spectrum efficiency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548750","abstract":"The millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band is used in the 5th generation wireless systems, in which the high frequency unavoidably causes rapid attenuation. Therefore, multiple millimeter-wave power amplifiers (PAs) are utilized to achieve power amplification and to extend transmission range. However, the nonlinear effect is induced after the increased input power. To compensate the nonlinear effect of PAs, the transmitted signal can be pre-compensated by the digital pre-distortion (DPD) technology. In this paper, we verify the application performance of mmWave over-the-air (OTA) nonlinear PAs with DPD compensation. The research and simulation results confirm that the nonlinear problem and signal distortion caused by the power amplifier can be reduced by the indirect-learning based DPD technology, thereby improving the spectrum efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/APWCS50173.2021.9548750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWCS50173.2021.9548750","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE VTS 17th Asia Pacific Wireless Communications Symposium (APWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548745/9548714/09548750.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE VTS 17th Asia Pacific Wireless Communications Symposium (APWCS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Experimental Validation of Digital Pre-distortion Techniques for mmWave OTA with Multiple Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Design and Experimental Validation of Digital Pre-distortion Techniques for mmWave OTA with Multiple Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","conferenceDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9548750/","accessionNumber":"21159456","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548750/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Experimental Validation of Digital Pre-distortion Techniques for mmWave OTA with Multiple Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"2021002881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046743S","chronDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548745","isNumber":"9548714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548745","xplore-issue":"9548714","articleId":"9548750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548752,"authors":[{"name":"Aisha Javed","affiliation":["Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Aisha","lastName":"Javed","id":"37088978767"},{"name":"Naveed Ul Hassan","affiliation":["Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Naveed Ul","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37530376200"},{"name":"Chau Yuen","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore"],"firstName":"Chau","lastName":"Yuen","id":"37273147100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0120-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0121-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548752","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate and Stable Wi-Fi based Indoor Localization and Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE VTS 17th Asia Pacific Wireless Communications Symposium (APWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548745/9548714/09548752.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE VTS 17th Asia Pacific Wireless Communications Symposium (APWCS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWCS50173.2021.9548752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548714","doi":"10.1109/APWCS50173.2021.9548752","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Wireless communication","Databases","Buildings","Fingerprint recognition","Indoor environment","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor Positioning","Wi-Fi Fingerprinting","Convolution Neural Network (CNN)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548752","abstract":"Indoor localization is essential for providing location based services inside homes, malls, and hospitals. Wi-Fi routers are available in almost every building and Wi-Fi chipsets are also available in almost every smartphone. Therefore, fingerprinting of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values coming from Wi-Fi routers is a cheaper option for indoor localization. In conventional Wi-Fi fingerprinting methods, RSSI values are collected at various indoor locations and stored in a database. The device which needs localization, collects new RSSI values from its current unknown location. These values are compared with the database and the best match is returned as the current user location. Due to differences in Wi-Fi chipsets and environmental conditions, RSSI values fluctuate which makes accurate, stable, fast, and precise determination of user location difficult. If the user is inside a large multi-floor building, dataset scalability and RSSI fluctuations can make the task even more difficult. User tracking and determination of the direction in which the user is moving also becomes challenging due to hurdles and non-walkable points in the indoor environment. To solve these issues, in this paper we present a Wi-Fi fingerprinting method for large indoor environments that uses 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNN) for floor and region-status (hurdle, walkable point) classification. The procedure consists of collecting RSSI dataset which is then normalized and pre-processed. This step is essential for training the classification and localization model. The trained model can be used in real-time for fast, stable, and accurate classification of floors, region-status and user location coordinates. Based on our experiments inside a two floor university library, the proposed approach can classify the floors and region-status with an accuracy of 70.50% and 81.23% respectively, while the mean localization error is 3.47 m.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548752/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","conferenceDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accurate and Stable Wi-Fi based Indoor Localization and Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010139","fundingName":"Lahore University of Management Sciences"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate and Stable Wi-Fi based Indoor Localization and Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"2021003119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067647S","chronDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548745","isNumber":"9548714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548745","xplore-issue":"9548714","articleId":"9548752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9548754,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Hsuan Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Hsuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280028900"},{"name":"Jo-Han Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jo-Han","lastName":"Lu","id":"37088977794"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0120-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0121-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548754","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Wireless communication","Schedules","Simulation","Heuristic algorithms","Performance gain","Dynamic scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Previous studies revealed that low-density parity-check convolutional codes (LDPC-CC) with rational parity-check matrices may outperform LDPC-CC with ordinary polynomial parity-check matrices. However, such a performance improvement relies on a dynamic scheduling-aided decoding scheme with high processing latency which may prevent LDPC-CC with rational parity-check matrices from practical applications. In this paper, we find that conventional belief-propagation algorithms suitable for high-speed parallel implementation can still provide the satisfactory performance gain for LDPC-CC with rational parity-check matrices as long as some virtual channel outputs which can accelerate the convergence of iterative decoding are properly supplied. Criteria for generating virtual channel outputs are investigated from the viewpoint of Tanner graph. Simulation results are also provided for performance verification.","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE VTS 17th Asia Pacific Wireless Communications Symposium (APWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE VTS 17th Asia Pacific Wireless Communications Symposium (APWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548745/9548714/09548754.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Belief-Propagation Decoding with Virtual Channel Outputs for LDPC Convolutional Codes with Rational Parity-Check Matrices","doi":"10.1109/APWCS50173.2021.9548754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWCS50173.2021.9548754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Improved Belief-Propagation Decoding with Virtual Channel Outputs for LDPC Convolutional Codes with Rational Parity-Check Matrices","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548754/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Belief-Propagation Decoding with Virtual Channel Outputs for LDPC Convolutional Codes with Rational Parity-Check Matrices","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"2021002890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05598S","chronDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548745","isNumber":"9548714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548745","xplore-issue":"9548714","articleId":"9548754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9548769,"authors":[{"name":"Shoko Nishimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoko","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"37088979485"},{"name":"Satoshi Suyama","affiliation":["6G Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO INC., Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Suyama","id":"37297955700"},{"name":"Takahiro Asai","affiliation":["6G Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO INC., Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Asai","id":"37085376515"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Otsuka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Otsuka","id":"37396597400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0120-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0121-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548769","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","5G mobile communication","Array signal processing","Millimeter wave technology","Modulation","Bandwidth","Delay lines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HetNets","millimeter wave","3D beamforming","sectorized picocell","tapped delay line models"]}],"abstract":"Fifth-generation (5G) New Radio (NR) with non-standalone (NSA) operation, i.e., 5G NR NSA, which enables 5G NR deployments using existing the fourth-generation (4G) mobile systems have been introduced to diffuse 5G mobile systems. With the same configuration as a heterogeneous network (HetNet), 5G NR NSA deployments combine with macrocells by 4G and picocells by 5G in the same coverage. The use of millimeter wave bands in 5G NR is expected to achieve higher data rates because the available amount of signal bandwidth is enormous. Therefore, multiband HetNets with picocells operating at millimeter wave band can increase the system capacity and/or achieve higher data rate. To compensate for the large signal path-loss due to the use of millimeter wave band, we have proposed sectorized picocells with three-dimensional beamforming (3D-BF) in HetNets. In this paper, we investigate the transmission performance of multiband HetNets with sectorized picocells with 3D-BF operating at 28 GHz band in multipath fading channels based on tapped delay line models. Using system-level computer simulations, we clarify the average and 5-percentile user throughput of the HetNet using three-sector picocells with 3D-BF operating at 28 GHz band, whose bandwidth is 10 times wider than that of the macrocell operating at 2 GHz. We also clarify that the proposed method can increase the use rate of high-order modulation scheme in the downlink modulation and coding schemes.","doi":"10.1109/APWCS50173.2021.9548769","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE VTS 17th Asia Pacific Wireless Communications Symposium (APWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9548745/9548714/09548769.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWCS50173.2021.9548769","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE VTS 17th Asia Pacific Wireless Communications Symposium (APWCS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Performance of HetNets using Sectorized Picocells with 3D Beamforming at 28 GHz Band in Multipath Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Performance of HetNets using Sectorized Picocells with 3D Beamforming at 28 GHz Band in Multipath Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548769/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9548769/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2021","conferenceDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Performance of HetNets using Sectorized Picocells with 3D Beamforming at 28 GHz Band in Multipath Fading Channels","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"2021003076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09969S","chronDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9548745","isNumber":"9548714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9548745","xplore-issue":"9548714","articleId":"9548769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9548773,"authors":[{"name":"Shiori Tosaka","affiliation":["Graduate School / Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Shiori","lastName":"Tosaka","id":"37088977455"},{"name":"Toshihiko Nishimura","affiliation":["Graduate School / Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiko","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"37287475700"},{"name":"Takeo Ohgane","affiliation":["Graduate School / Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeo","lastName":"Ohgane","id":"37284385100"},{"name":"Yasutaka Ogawa","affiliation":["Graduate School / Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasutaka","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"37280241700"},{"name":"Junichiro Hagiwara","affiliation":["Graduate School / Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Junichiro","lastName":"Hagiwara","id":"37719963000"},{"name":"Takanori Sato","affiliation":["Graduate School / Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Takanori","lastName":"Sato","id":"37088979417"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0120-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0121-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9548773","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Base stations","Simulation","Transmitting antennas","Channel estimation","Massive MIMO","Downlink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","multipath","compressed sensing","FISTA","support set"]}],"abstract":"Although TDD has been mainly considered for massive MIMO systems, many traditional systems have been operating in FDD, and FDD may generally be more effective for delay-sensitive applications.

Most of the kernel-based learning approaches rely on a pre-selected kernel, the choice of which presumes task-specific prior information. In addition, most existing frameworks assume that data are collected centrally at batch.

To cope with these challenges, the present work develops an online multi-kernel learning scheme to infer the intended nonlinear function \u2018on the fly\u2019 from data samples that are collected in distributed locations. To address communication efficiency among distributed nodes, we study the effects of quantization and develop a distributed and quantized online multiple kernel learning algorithm.

The adoption mmWave technology in radar systems enables better resolution and aid in detecting smaller drones. Using radar cross-section (RCS) signature enables us to detect malicious drones and suitable action can be taken by respective authorities. Existing drone classification converts the RCS signature into images and then performs drone classification using a convolution neural network (CNN). Converting every signature into an image induces additional computation overhead; further CNN model is trained considering fixed learning rate. Thus, when using CNN-based drone classification under a highly dynamic environment exhibit poor classification accuracy. This paper present an improved long short-term memory (LSTM) by introducing a weight optimization model that can reduce computation overhead by not allowing the gradient to not flow through hidden states of the LSTM model. Further, present adaptive learning rate optimizing (ALRO) model for training the LSTM model.

However, the untested validity of the assumption motivates this letter. Considering an absorbing receiver placed in a free-diffusion molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) system, we analyze the randomness in terms of the distribution of the peak time using simulated data and define one of the parameters. In addition, we derive the semi-analytical expressions of the distribution by using Poisson and Normal approximations of the absorbed molecules. Through numerical analysis, we evaluate the accuracy of the models and demonstrate that the Poisson model achieves a better fit. The key finding is that the distribution has extreme values resulting in a heavy right-tail and this information can be a useful tool to develop improved channel models.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09548899.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3115724","startPage":"3833","endPage":"3837","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3115724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Probability Distribution of a Signal\u2019s Peak Time in a Molecular Diffusive Media","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"12","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548899/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"2017R1A2B4002622 and 2021R1A2C1003507"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Probability Distribution of a Signal\u2019s Peak Time in a Molecular Diffusive Media","sourcePdf":"lcomm-cho-3115724-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06466S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9548899","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9548902,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Hyoung Choi","affiliation":["School of Dentistry, Advanced Dental Device Development Institute, Kyungpook National University, Jung-gu, Daegu, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9548902/choi-3115942-small.gif","p":["Ho-Hyoung Choi (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in mobile communication engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea, in 2012.

Achieving the computational color constancy requires going through two phases: the illumination estimation, which will be the primary focus of this work, and the human visual perception-based chromatic adaptation. At the first phase, illumination estimation is to predict RGB triplets, the numeric representations of incident illuminant colors, by calculating the values of image pixels. How much the network can increase its estimation accuracy is a key to realizing computational color constancy. With recent advances in deep learning (DL), a lot of deep learning-based approaches have been suggested, bringing higher accuracy to computer vision applications, but there are still quite a few obstacles to overcome such as instability of learning. In an attempt to address this ill-posed problem in the illumination estimation space, this article presents a novel deep learning-based approach, the Cascading Residual Network Architecture (CRNA), which incorporates the ResNet and cascading mechanism into the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The cascading mechanism enables the proposed network to restrain from suddenly varying in size, serves to mitigate learning instability, and accordingly reduces the quality degradation. This is attributed to the ability of the cascading mechanism that fine-tunes the pre-trained DCNN. Considerable amounts of datasets and comparative experiments highlight that the proposed approach delivers more stable and robust results and imply the potential for generalization of the proposed approach across deep learning applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548902/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21103558","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Very Deep Learning-Based Illumination Estimation Approach With Cascading Residual Network Architecture (CRNA)","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea by the Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2019R1I1A3A01061844"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"NRF of Korea by the Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2018R1D1A1B07040457"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Very Deep Learning-Based Illumination Estimation Approach With Cascading Residual Network Architecture (CRNA)","sourcePdf":"access-choi-3115942-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08973S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548902","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548905,"authors":[{"name":"Ping-Yao Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Photonic System, National Chiao-Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ping-Yao","lastName":"Huang","id":"38548367900"},{"name":"Pin-Hsuan Ting","affiliation":["Institute of Imaging and Biomedical Photonics, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pin-Hsuan","lastName":"Ting","orcid":"0000-0002-1395-698X","id":"37088910217"},{"name":"Yu-Jen Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Lighting and Energy Photonics, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Jen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088985026"},{"name":"Chia-Chien Wei","affiliation":["National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Chien","lastName":"Wei","orcid":"0000-0003-1947-8146","id":"37419349200"},{"name":"Chun-Ting Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Photonic System, National Chiao-Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Ting","lastName":"Lin","orcid":"0000-0001-5243-6242","id":"37291397400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"9548905","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading channels","MIMO communication","Optical receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Couplings","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless communication","millimeter wave","multiple-input multiple-output","radio-over-fiber","radio-over-few-mode-fiber","mode-division-multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"Optical carrier power fading is a severe problem in radio-over-few-mode-fiber (RoFMF) direct-detection system.

This paper proposes an energy-efficient processor design based on Deep Belief Network (DBN), which is one of the most suitable DNN models for on- chip learning. In this study, a thorough algorithm-architecture-circuit design optimization method is used for efficient design. The characteristics of data reuse and data sparsity in the DBN learning algorithm inspires this study to propose a heterogeneous multi-core architecture with local learning. In addition, novel circuits of transposable weight memory and sparse address generator are proposed to reduce weight memory access and exploit neuron state sparsity, respectively, for maximizing the energy efficiency. The DBN processor is implemented and thoroughly evaluated on Xilinx Zynq FPGA. Implementation results confirm that the proposed DBN processor has excellent energy efficiency of 45.0 pJ per neuron-weight update, which has been improved by 74% against the conventional design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548916/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548916/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Deep Belief Network Processor Based on Heterogeneous Multi-Core Architecture With Transposable Memory and On-Chip Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2019YFB1310001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61974053"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds of the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2019KFYXJJS049"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Efficient Deep Belief Network Processor Based on Heterogeneous Multi-Core Architecture With Transposable Memory and On-Chip Learning","sourcePdf":"jetcas-wang-3114396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122977S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9548916","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9548918,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm has been adopted and assimilated into the back-propagation learning algorithm for training feed-forward neural networks. The inputs of ANN are organized in coordination with the results obtained from the observability analysis of synchronous generator dynamic parameters in its dynamic behaviour. A collection of 10 ANNs with similar input patterns and different outputs are developed to determine a set of dynamic parameters. The trained ANNs are employed in a real-time operational environment for estimating generator parameters using online measurements acquired during disturbance conditions. The ANNs are employed and tested to identify generator parameters using online measurements obtained during different disturbances. Simulation studies demonstrate the ability of the ANNs to accurately estimate dynamic parameters of hydro-generators. The results also show the impact of test conditions on the accuracy degree of estimation for these parameters. The optimal structure of ANNs is also determined to minimize the error in estimating each dynamic parameter.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115783","startPage":"134638","endPage":"134648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09548918.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Line Determination of Salient-Pole Hydro Generator Parameters by Neural Network Estimator Using Operating Data (PEANN)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548918/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On-Line Determination of Salient-Pole Hydro Generator Parameters by Neural Network Estimator Using Operating Data (PEANN)","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9548918/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21103642","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000839","fundingName":"University of Reading"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On-Line Determination of Salient-Pole Hydro Generator Parameters by Neural Network Estimator Using Operating Data (PEANN)","sourcePdf":"access-shariati-3115783-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124361S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548918","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9548923,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen DiAdamo","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"DiAdamo","orcid":"0000-0001-5758-9563"},{"name":"Janis N\u00f6tzel","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany","Munich Center for Quantum Science and Technology (MCQST), M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Janis","lastName":"N\u00f6tzel","orcid":"0000-0003-0091-3072"},{"name":"Simon Sekav\u010dnik","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Sekav\u010dnik"},{"name":"Riccardo Bassoli","affiliation":["Deutsche Telekom Chair of Communication Networks, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Institute of Communication Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Bassoli","orcid":"0000-0002-6132-7985"},{"name":"Roberto Ferrara","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Ferrara"},{"name":"Christian Deppe","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Deppe","orcid":"0000-0003-3047-3549"},{"name":"Frank H.P.

As signals from the global positioning system cannot be received inside buildings, only approximate locations can be estimated using Wi-Fi routers or cellular base station information, and exact locations cannot be determined. Therefore, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) scheme using several sensors is suggested in this work. However, this scheme requires users to hold their smartphones in a specific manner; furthermore, user-dependent parameters, such as height and step length, are necessary because the sensor parameters vary. This study uses deep-learning algorithms to overcome the limitations of the existing smartphone-based PDR scheme. A convolutional neural network algorithm is used to classify the smartphone positions; then, appropriate sensor data are selected and adjusted. The long short-term memory algorithm is used to estimate the user step length. Although the PDR performance is enhanced using the deep-learning algorithm, accumulated error is unavoidable because the algorithm traces the relative position with reference to the original location. Therefore, optical camera communication is introduced to provide the reference location and periodically compensate for the accumulated PDR error. The proposed algorithm is experimentally demonstrated, and its results are obtained and analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548931/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21103625","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Positioning Using Deep-Learning-Based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning and Optical Camera Communication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2018R1D1A1A09083825 and NRF-2021R1F1A1048227"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Indoor Positioning Using Deep-Learning-Based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning and Optical Camera Communication","sourcePdf":"access-park-3115808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069383S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9548931","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9548940,"authors":[{"name":"Maliheh Forouzanmehr","affiliation":["Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Maliheh","lastName":"Forouzanmehr"},{"name":"Soroush Akhlaghi","affiliation":["Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Soroush","lastName":"Akhlaghi","orcid":"0000-0001-6398-2951"},{"name":"Ata Khalili","affiliation":["Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ata","lastName":"Khalili","orcid":"0000-0002-3845-1144"},{"name":"Qingqing Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau, Macau","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qingqing","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-0043-3266"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9548940","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter investigates the design of resource allocation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted uplink network. The design is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem which jointly optimizes the antenna selection (AS) and power allocation at user sides and the beamforming matrices adopted at the BS and IRS. To facilitate the design of a suboptimal solution, we first decompose the original problem into two sub-problems via the alternative optimization (AO) method. In particular, for the first sub-problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the majorization minimization (MM) approach to make the numerator of the fractional problem into a concave form and then we employed the Dinkelbach algorithm. For the second sub-problem, we adopt the inner approximation (IA) method to optimize the beamforming matrices at the BS and IRS. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over benchmark schemes for the case of a single antenna case and also provide considerable performance gains due to the use of an antenna selection strategy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency Maximization for IRS-Assisted Uplink Systems: Joint Resource Allocation and Beamforming Design","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3115812","endPage":"3936","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09548940.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","startPage":"3932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3115812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548940","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Optimization","Antennas","Resource management","Uplink","Matrix decomposition","MISO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)","energy efficiency (EE)","and antenna selection (AS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Maximization for IRS-Assisted Uplink Systems: Joint Resource Allocation and Beamforming Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9548940/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Macau Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR","grantNumber":"SKL-IOTSC(UM)-2021-2023, 0119/2020/A3 and 0108/2020/A"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong NSF","grantNumber":"2021A1515011900"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2021D15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency Maximization for IRS-Assisted Uplink Systems: Joint Resource Allocation and Beamforming Design","sourcePdf":"lcomm-akhlaghi-3115812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051455S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9548940","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9548949,"authors":[{"name":"Debajyoti Pal","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, King Mongkut\u2019s University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/9660829/9548949/pal-3115847-small.gif","p":["Debajyoti Pal received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Nagpur University, Nagpur, India, in 2005, the M.Tech. degree in information technology from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology Shibpur, Kolkata, India, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in information technology from the School of IT, KMUTT, Bangkok, Thailand, where he is currently a Lecturer.

Often times, there are significant security and privacy issues with these devices, which are unknown to the users when they decide to purchase. While existing CE literatures have investigated the technical aspects of securing a device or protecting privacy, what effects these factors have on the purchase decision of the users of CIoT devices is unknown. The current work attempts to solve this gap in CE knowledge by investigating how security affects the purchase decision, what personal factors are relevant in this scenario, and what effects does framing have on the purchase decision. A mixed-method study design is used for data collection combining semi-structured interviews and a stated-choice experiment. An Exploratory Factor Analysis is used for identifying the personal factors. A Multinomial Logit Model approach is used for testing the proposed causal model. Security has the highest effect on purchase decision, followed by price, functionality, and aesthetics & coolness. The effects of framing are also established in relation to gain frames. Based on the results different buyer categories are identified, and the research implications are discussed from a CE community perspective.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2021.3115847","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","startPage":"305","endPage":"318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2021.3115847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660829","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/9660829/09548949.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Security","Object recognition","Internet of Things","Consumer products","Authentication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consumer electronics","consumer Internet of Things (CIoT)","framing","purchase decision","security & privacy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the Antecedents of Consumer Electronics IoT Devices Purchase Decision: A Mixed Methods Study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548949/","volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9548949/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004705","fundingName":"KMUTT Research Funding"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring the Antecedents of Consumer Electronics IoT Devices Purchase Decision: A Mixed Methods Study","sourcePdf":"tce-pal-3115847-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080439S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"9660829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","xplore-issue":"9660829","articleId":"9548949","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9548950,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Liu","affiliation":["Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Information Communication Network and Security, Xi\u2019an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-1513-3872"},{"name":"Howard H.

Particularly, the concurrent transmissions of devices under NOMA provoke interactions of queues, which renders an entangled stochastic process to the analysis of PAoI. To this end, we first present an algorithmic solution to calculate the queue service rate, and then we derive analytical expression for the distribution of PAoI, which can be utilized to evaluate the statistics and the violation probability of PAoI. Based on the analysis, which is validated by simulations, we show that in terms of network average PAoI, NOMA considerably outperforms orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in the regime of more frequent update arrivals. We also find that the discrepancy on PAoI violation probability among different NOMA devices heavily hinges on the update arrival rate, demonstrating the critical role of the update dynamic in PAoI performance. The derived results allows us to extract valuable insights from the problem.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2021.3115803","startPage":"2757","endPage":"2761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2021.3115803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642026","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/9642026/09548950.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Peak Age of Information in NOMA IoT Networks With Stochastic Arrivals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548950/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Peak Age of Information in NOMA IoT Networks With Stochastic Arrivals","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9548950/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071377"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Peak Age of Information in NOMA IoT Networks With Stochastic Arrivals","sourcePdf":"lwc-liu-3115803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053828S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"9642026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","xplore-issue":"9642026","articleId":"9548950","onlineDate":"27 September 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9548968,"authors":[{"name":"Naren","affiliation":["BITS, Pilani, India"],"bio":{"p":["Naren (f2015547@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in) completed his B.E. in electrical and electronics engineering, and M.Sc (Hons) in physics from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani.

A rich variety of contact tracing applications, each offering its own unique set of features, are currently being used to track the spread of the virus from person to person, and isolate/quarantine suspected individuals. However, existing approaches have not been very successful since they lack incentives to motivate users to use them actively. Although each solution provides some form of privacy protection and data security, loopholes do exist, and there is scope for improvement. In this context, we explore the use of blockchain to help in advancing contact tracing applications. In this article, we describe how blockchain could offer enhanced data security and functionality without compromising users' privacy. The effectiveness of contact tracing applications improves with the user base. In this regard, we explore how blockchain-based smart contracts can be used to offer incentives to users at various stages of the contact tracing process. Next, we lay down a plan for future contact tracing frameworks that provide the advantages of blockchain and user incentives, and all the best features available in current solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2021","publicationDate":"September 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9548968/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","volume":"4","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving and Incentivized Contact Tracing for COVID-19 Using Blockchain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Preserving and Incentivized Contact Tracing for COVID-19 Using Blockchain","sourcePdf":"020GUIZANI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048916S","chronDate":"September  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8548628","isNumber":"9548846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8548628","xplore-issue":"9548846","articleId":"9548968","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":9548970,"authors":[{"name":"Amuleen Gulati","affiliation":["Ericsson, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Amuleen Gulati (amuleengulati13@gmail.com) received her B.Tech. in computer science and engineering from Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, India, in 2016 and her M.Tech. degree in computer software engineering from Thapar University, India, in 2018.

In content-centric networking (CCN) architecture, contents are accessed by name rather than the physical location where these are stored, which results in more flexible and robust content-based architecture. However, the broadcast nature of devices in CCN causes network congestion and latency. The Internet of Healthcare Vehicles (IoHV) is an evolving paradigm that relies on smart transportation involving ambulances and other healthcare vehicles (for rapid COVID testing) to connect with each other through the Internet, especially in case like COVID 19 testing and contact tracing. However, the applications of IoHV are not similar to other networks and therefore bring new technical challenges due to high mobility and rapid changes of topology. Therefore, to handle these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel scheme that finds an optimal path. Using the optimal path, the interest packet is forwarded among healthcare vehicles in a smart city scenario. The proposed scheme maximizes the probability of finding the requested data while minimizing latency. As the proposed scheme does not involve broadcasting of interest packets, the problem of network congestion in CCN can be solved to a large extent. In order to facilitate the interoperability of heterogeneous healthcare devices in the network, and to improve the routing flexibility, an SDN controller is deployed in the IoHV scenario. It maintains the global information of the network in its flow tables. Moreover, to achieve faster response time and lower latency in the IoHV environment, edge devices are utilized instead of central cloud. Keeping in view the memory constraints of edge devices, deletable Bloom filters are used for storage and caching. Finally, the open issues and challenges related to the proposed solution for the IoHV scenario are also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548970/","volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/9548970/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Software-Defined Content Dissemination Scheme for Internet of Healthcare Vehicles in COVID-Like Scenarios","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001314","fundingName":"Durham University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software-Defined Content Dissemination Scheme for Internet of Healthcare Vehicles in COVID-Like Scenarios","sourcePdf":"013AUJLA_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042404S","chronDate":"September  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8548628","isNumber":"9548846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8548628","xplore-issue":"9548846","articleId":"9548970","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":9548972,"authors":[{"name":"Thippa Reddy Gadekallu","affiliation":["Vellore Institute of Technology, India"],"bio":{"p":["Thippa Reddy Gadekallu is currently working as an associate professor in the School of Information Technology and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, India.

The only solution to the problem is getting sanitized and maintaining social distancing. Keeping all these in mind, an IoT-based application is an alternative to this problem. IoT-based location fixation and sanitization through a quadcopter is proposed. This work proposes the control design of a quad-copter UAV that helps to sanitize a COVID-19 containment zone based on latitude and longitude of the specific area. Stability is one of the important parameters in automatic control. The stable control of a quadcopter is an important issue for sanitization. There are two aspects of the design. First is the control of the movements of the quadcopter using an interval type 2 fuzzy-logic-based PID controller; second is the control of drop location of the quadcopter. The location data is fed to the telemetry of the quadcopter UAV through a COVID-19 drone Android application. To achieve balanced and stable performance of a quadcopter UAV with a center of gravity, variables are well managed. Both the controls used are based on interval type 2 fuzzy logic because of its ability to emulate the footprint of uncertainty and higher accuracy in nonlinear dynamic systems. Further, the work can be carried out for several applications in the field of medicine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2021","publicationDate":"September 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9548973/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","volume":"4","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of an Intelligent Controller of a Self-Tuned Quadcopter for IoT-Based Application on COVID Infected Area Sanitization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an Intelligent Controller of a Self-Tuned Quadcopter for IoT-Based Application on COVID Infected Area Sanitization","sourcePdf":"011MOHANTY_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041442S","chronDate":"September  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8548628","isNumber":"9548846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8548628","xplore-issue":"9548846","articleId":"9548973","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":9548974,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsin Raza","affiliation":["Edge Hill University, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"p":["Mohsin Raza (razam@edgehill.ac.uk) is a senior lecturer at Edge Hill University, United Kingdom.

Countries where the pandemic has hit hard have brought healthcare institutes to the verge of collapsing, where the capabilities of healthcare departments and hospitals are tested over and over. In these challenging circumstances, the technology alternatives are stressed as never before, and the need for transformation of healthcare from traditional techniques to technology-driven healthcare solutions is advocated. While the Internet of Things (IoT) and other healthcare technologies (machine learning, cloud, edge computing, security) have been under development for years, none of the developments were planned to sustain immense pressure, such as that experienced during pandemics and special circumstances. Therefore, a suitable transformation in healthcare technologies is very desirable to cope with the exacerbating world healthcare infrastructure. This article discusses the role of IoT and intelligent healthcare services in emerging health-related threats and challenges. It discusses the limitations, challenges, and future of IoT in health crises. The article also stresses extensive healthcare infrastructure, which benefits from IoT, artificial intelligence, distributed control, cognitive decision support services, security and privacy, blockchain, and cloud and edge services. We use the heuristic bargaining algorithm to maximize the profit of the participants of the task migration in order to increase their enthusiasm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2021","publicationDate":"September 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9548974/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","volume":"4","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Challenges and Limitations of Internet of Things Enabled Healthcare in COVID-19","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006129","fundingName":"FCT"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006111","fundingName":"MCTES"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)","grantNumber":"313036/2020-9"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges and Limitations of Internet of Things Enabled Healthcare in COVID-19","sourcePdf":"018RAZA_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039471S","chronDate":"September  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8548628","isNumber":"9548846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8548628","xplore-issue":"9548846","articleId":"9548974","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":9548976,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxuan Yang","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yuxuan Yang (yuxuanyang@mail.dlut.edu.cn) received his B.S. degree from Dalian Maritime University in 2019.

Therefore, the effective allocation of communication, computing, and cache (3C) resources becomes increasingly important. In this article, we first study the unique characters of IoMT and construct a distributed 3C resource framework.

A case study is provided to demonstrate the high efficiency of the designed 3C resource allocation strategy.

A tremendous amount of IoT applications has highly eased people's daily lives, and improved allocations and usage of a broad range of resources (power bank sharing, bike sharing, etc.). However, the ingrained openness of underlying wireless systems renders these IoT entities vulnerable to a broad range of cyber risks, such as vulnerabilities of spectrum that can be a source of adversarial inference. Furthermore, as our reliance on wireless/connected devices and radios has also been dramatically increasing, public safety, business operations, socializing, and navigation as well as critical national communication infrastructures have become more vulnerable to cyber threats. In addition, the stream of data from IoT devices are also prone to cyber risks, which is of major concern for end users, and could also mislead users and ML models with wrong information during the training and learning phases. Hence, policymakers and industries have recently begun to perceive that the expansion of connected devices and their cyber susceptibility results in a large malicious and inferential risk. As a result, there is a need to identify and comprehend these risks in order to elaborate efficient security solutions. Moreover, the economic impact of IoT devices and associated security vulnerabilities are further growing in accordance with artificial intelligence (AI) integration into human-computer interaction (HCI), including banking, insurance, and so on. Consequently, cyber risks are growing in terms of both frequency and acuteness. Therefore, this article discusses the evolution of common real-time machine learning (RTML) approaches, which are considered as enablers for ensemble learning-based use cases. We discuss a cyber risk detection framework that can be built effectively using Boosting- and Bagging-based ensemble learning approaches.","doi":"10.1109/IOTM.0011.2100019","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/8548628/9548846/09548988.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOTM.0011.2100019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental Learning Implementations and Vision for Cyber Risk Detection in IoT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548988/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2021","displayDocTitle":"Incremental Learning Implementations and Vision for Cyber Risk Detection in IoT","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548988/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental Learning Implementations and Vision for Cyber Risk Detection in IoT","sourcePdf":"027RAHOUTI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042695S","chronDate":"September  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8548628","isNumber":"9548846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8548628","xplore-issue":"9548846","articleId":"9548988","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":9548990,"authors":[{"name":"Shengbo Chen","affiliation":["Henan University, China"],"bio":{"p":["Shengbo Chen (ccb02kingdom@gmail.com) received his B.E. and M.E. degrees from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from Ohio State University, Columbus, in 2013.

Maintaining a comfortable and stable temperature is crucial for the treatment, rehabilitation and daily e-health care of patients, where the Internet of Things has been widely applied for this purpose. However, the existing research always separates the network design from temperature monitoring and control. In order to provide better e-health services, we design a solution to minimize the cost of energy consumption and delay. This work discusses a cyber-physical design for an indoor temperature monitoring system using a wireless sensor network. All sensors dynamically adjust the sleep/wake duty cycles and select the optimal anycast routing according to the sensed temperature. In addition, IoT-enabled heating, ventilation, and air conditioner (HVAC) systems for indoor temperature control have attracted unprecedented attention. HVAC can be connected to the Internet for weather and time-varying electricity price data. This work discusses the problem of minimizing the total energy cost of the HVAC system while keeping the indoor temperature within a prefixed range. The key idea is to leverage the time-varying electricity prices and do precooling/preheating using HVAC. The simulation results show that our temperature monitoring and control algorithm outperforms other heuristic schemes.","doi":"10.1109/IOTM.0011.2000054","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/8548628/9548846/09548990.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOTM.0011.2000054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9548846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When Internet of Things Meets e-Health: An Indoor Temperature Monitoring and Control Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2021","displayDocTitle":"When Internet of Things Meets e-Health: An Indoor Temperature Monitoring and Control Approach","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9548990/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)","grantNumber":"JP18K18044"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"When Internet of Things Meets e-Health: An Indoor Temperature Monitoring and Control Approach","sourcePdf":"008YU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043432S","chronDate":"September  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8548628","isNumber":"9548846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8548628","xplore-issue":"9548846","articleId":"9548990","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":9548993,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The convergence of smart sensors has prioritized the development of eHealth technologies. In a telecommunication system, it is primarily concerned with the development of core technologies that enable electronic applications associated with 5G networks to achieve the confidential connectivity. Of late, it has increasingly been drawing its research interest for big data, IoT, fog, and cloud computing. However, security and privacy are still challenging to eHealth applications including the Internet of Medical Things, Internet of Health Things, and Mobile Internet of Things. Such guaranteed characteristics converge communication, computing, and caching (3C) to inherit large-scale economic and societal benefits. Thus, this work presents the challenges of secure authentication and key agreement (S-AKA) schemes that envision the security efficiencies of intelligent sensing technologies. S-AKA schemes are hard to break in real-time practice and have become the most useful contribution to modern cryptography. Such authentication schemes allow two or more communication parties to establish a secure session key to ensure data authenticity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9548993/","volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/9548993/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"How to Exploit 5G Networks for IoT e-Health Security and Privacy Challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to Exploit 5G Networks for IoT e-Health Security and Privacy Challenges","sourcePdf":"007DEEBAK_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044198S","chronDate":"September  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8548628","isNumber":"9548846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8548628","xplore-issue":"9548846","articleId":"9548993","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":9549008,"authors":[{"name":"Xintong Ling","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xintong","lastName":"Ling","orcid":"0000-0001-7033-395X"},{"name":"Pengcheng Chen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-5904-8285"},{"name":"Jiaheng Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaheng","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-9783-5471"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Ding","orcid":"0000-0002-2649-2125"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9549008","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Broker: Dynamic Multi-Hop Routing Protocol in Blockchain Radio Access Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Blockchains","Mobile ad hoc networks","Routing protocols","Smart contracts","Routing","Receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain radio access network (B-RAN)","mobile ad-hoc network (MANET)","routing protocol"]}],"abstract":"Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is an infrastructure-less extended scenario of blockchain radio access network (B-RAN); meanwhile, the decentralization of B-RAN befits MANETs. In the framework of B-RAN, we propose a blockchain-based multi-hop routing protocol, namely Data Broker, for non-cooperative MANETs. To incentivize the collaboration among selfish peers, we record the identity information of participating brokers on a ledger list. However, blockchain cannot guarantee the integrity of such a routing ledger directly. Therefore, we design a ledger safeguard mechanism, along with reward policies, to avoid the ledger list being tampered with or modified by dishonest brokers.

Specifically, an IRS consists of a great amount of low-cost passive reflecting elements, which reflect the incident signals to the desired user by collaboratively using passive beamforming. This paper introduces IRSs into a device-to-device (D2D) underlying cellular system to enhance transmission rate performance of the D2D pairs. We formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the transmission rate of the D2D pairs while satisfying the minimum required rate of the cellular users. We address this problem by jointly optimizing the reuse indicator, received beamforming, power allocation, and phase shift matrices. Block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is adopted to decouple the original problem into four subproblems. Closed form solutions are obtained by solving the sub-problems of optimizing the received beamforming and power allocation. Then, Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm and minimization-majorization (MM) algorithm are adopted to solve the sub-problems of optimizing the reuse indicator and phase shift matrices, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that IRSs can effectively improve the transmission rate of the D2D pairs and our proposed distributed IRSs scheme outperforms the other benchmark schemes.","doi":"10.23919/JCIN.2021.9549117","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Information Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Information Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/8892389/9549114/09549117.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCIN.2021.9549117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces-Aided Device-to-Device Communications System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"PTP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces-Aided Device-to-Device Communications System","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces-Aided Device-to-Device Communications System","sourcePdf":"197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015257S","chronDate":"Sept.  2021","isNumber":"9549114","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8892389","articleId":"9549117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"PTP","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":9549118,"authors":[{"name":"Huaqing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada"],"firstName":"Huaqing","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Jiayin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Conghao Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada"],"firstName":"Conghao","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Junling Li","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS), and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Junling","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Xuemin Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada"],"firstName":"Xuemin","lastName":"Shen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2096-1081"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2509-3312"}],"articleNumber":"9549118","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549118","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Costs","Low earth orbit satellites","Dynamic scheduling","Delays","Quality of service","Job shop scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["space-terrestrial integrated vehicular networks","LEO satellite communication","resource slicing and scheduling","reinforcement learning","matching-based optimization"]}],"doi":"10.23919/JCIN.2021.9549118","endPage":"223","startPage":"208","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Information Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Information Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/8892389/9549114/09549118.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCIN.2021.9549118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-Based Joint Resource Slicing and Scheduling in Space-Terrestrial Integrated Vehicular Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the resource slicing and scheduling problem in the space-terrestrial integrated vehicular networks to support both delay-sensitive services (DSSs) and delay-tolerant services (DTSs). Resource slicing and scheduling are to allocate spectrum resources to different slices and determine user association and bandwidth allocation for individual vehicles. To accommodate the dynamic network conditions, we first formulate a joint resource slicing and scheduling (JRSS) problem to minimize the long-term system cost, including the DSS requirement violation cost, DTS delay cost, and slice reconfiguration cost. Since resource slicing and scheduling decisions are interdependent with different timescales, we decompose the JRSS problem into a large-timescale resource slicing subproblem and a small-timescale resource scheduling subproblem. We propose a two-layered reinforcement learning (RL)-based JRSS scheme to find the solutions to the subproblems. In the resource slicing layer, spectrum resources are pre-allocated to different slices via a proximal policy optimization-based RL algorithm. In the resource scheduling layer, spectrum resources in each slice are scheduled to individual vehicles based on dynamic network conditions and service requirements via matching-based algorithms. We conduct extensive trace-driven experiments to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the system cost while satisfying service quality requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"PTP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549118/","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning-Based Joint Resource Slicing and Scheduling in Space-Terrestrial Integrated Vehicular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-Based Joint Resource Slicing and Scheduling in Space-Terrestrial Integrated Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053365S","chronDate":"Sept.  2021","isNumber":"9549114","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8892389","articleId":"9549118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"PTP","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":9549119,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Ting Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Yunting Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China"],"firstName":"Yunting","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Nan Cheng","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, and the State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an 710071, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Cheng"},{"name":"Xiaolin Yan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Yan"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2096-1081"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2509-3312"}],"articleNumber":"9549119","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549119","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Vehicle-to-everything","Games","Delays","Decision making","Performance analysis","Interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cellular V2X","SDN","cellular mode","reuse mode","dedicated mode","evolutionary game"]}],"doi":"10.23919/JCIN.2021.9549119","endPage":"236","startPage":"224","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Information Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Information Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/8892389/9549114/09549119.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCIN.2021.9549119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software-Defined Multi-Mode Access Management in Cellular V2X","abstract":"With the rapid development of vehicular access network, three different communication modes have emerged as the fundamental technologies in cellular V2X, i.e., cellular mode, reuse mode, and dedicated mode, through different spectrum sharing strategies.

For the purpose of shortening the delay of mapping and reducing the high computing load in the cloud, a radio monitoring system based on edge computing is developed to achieve the flexible, extensible and real-time monitoring of high-performance SDR applications. To promote the edge intelligence of deep learning (DL) service deployment through edge computing (EC), we developed an edge intelligence algorithm of convolutional neural network (CNN) based on attention mechanism to carry out modulation recognition (MR) of the edge signal and make MR closer to the antenna terminal.

First, most works exploit the sufficient labeled data to train the models and trigger the unfavorable experimental performance in semi-supervised learning. Second, some examinations solve the semi-supervised problem only by a samples graph or tags graph, limiting in improving the annotation results owing to the incomplete data structure. To this end, we propose a method called \"Semi-supervised Image Annotation with Parallel Graph Convolutional Networks (SPGCN)\". This algorithm combines graph convolutional networks (GCN) with image annotation to promote annotation performance under semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, SPGCN, connecting the tags graph with the samples graph, is proposed to improve annotation results, further considering tags\u2019 distribution and features\u2019 distribution to aggregate the features. Experiments on three benchmark image annotation datasets show that our approach outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549279","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549279.pdf","startPage":"7415","endPage":"7420","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-supervised Image Annotation with Parallel Graph Convolutional Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Semi-supervised Image Annotation with Parallel Graph Convolutional Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9549279/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-supervised Image Annotation with Parallel Graph Convolutional Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126366S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9549295,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwen Yuan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, P.

Some projection methods have been developed, but most of the popular ones require a vast knowledge in demography and only can be operated by skilled professionals.

These conditions are also suitable for traditional single layer signed networks. The numerical example shows the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549317","startPage":"5080","endPage":"5085","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549317.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bipartite consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems under multi-layer signed graphs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sufficient conditions","Network topology","System dynamics","Trajectory","Topology","Numerical models","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-layer networks","Signed graphs","Multi-agent systems","Bipartite consensus","Structural balance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Bipartite consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems under multi-layer signed graphs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9549317/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100018557","fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of Nantong City"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bipartite consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems under multi-layer signed graphs","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0864.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07793S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9549327,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088982958"},{"name":"Kaige Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kaige","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088986586"},{"name":"Qi Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086155781"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549327","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation error","Sufficient conditions","Fluctuations","Current measurement","Stability analysis","Linear matrix inequalities","Sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural networks","measurement outliers","dynamic event-triggered mechanism","H\u221e state estimation","stochastic parameters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549327","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the dynamic event-triggered H\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</inf>\n state estimation problem for a class of time-delayed neural networks subject to stochastic parameters and measurement outliers.

The method selects hardtanh function as the basic binarization function. This function changes alternately as the training epoch increases. It will eventually approach the sign function. And the method adjusts the threshold of binarization adaptively by introducing a learnable parameter. Based on the two CNN models of VGG-Small and ResNet-20, this paper conducts training with the adaptive binarization method on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results show that the proposed method is better than traditional methods (BC, BWN). And Its accuracy is very close to some advanced methods, while these methods have lower running speed. Therefore, the adaptive binarization method has higher accuracy, and it can achieve faster running speed in the application of binary neural network.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549344","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549344.pdf","startPage":"8123","endPage":"8127","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Binarization Method for Binary Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Binarization Method for Binary Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9549344/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Binarization Method for Binary Neural Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066721S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9549359,"authors":[{"name":"Xilai Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xilai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088983406"},{"name":"Meiqin Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Meiqin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37401511300"},{"name":"Senlin Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Senlin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37535987900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549359","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Surface reconstruction","Muscles","Aerospace electronics","Fatigue","Task analysis","Monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Muscle fatigue","multi-source sEMG","long short-term memory","attention mechanism","phase space reconstruction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549359","abstract":"Muscle fatigue detection can be of good help to many tasks such as athletes\u2019 physical training and soldiers\u2019 body status monitoring. Surface elecrtromyography (sEMG) signals are widely used in muscle fatigue detection. However, sEMG signals exist only when the muscle contracts and disappear when it relaxes, making muscle fatigue detection methods cannot work well in realistic applications. To solve this problem, a method based on phase space reconstruction is proposed to automatically filter useless signals and retain useful ones from raw sensor data, improving the practicality of the detection methods. In previous works on muscle fatigue detection, most researchers took only sEMG signals of the target muscle into consideration. However, in reality, when someone is doing physical work, several cooperative muscles rather than some single one participate in the task. Therefore, the exercise status of one muscle not only resides in its own sEMG signals, but also is included in its partners\u2019. For this reason, a fatigue detection method to muscle fatigue detection based on integrating multi-source sEMG signals is proposed, where long short-term memories (LSTM) and one attention layer are used as an inference model. Moreover, a series of sequential detection results are integrated to make a final result to deal with accidental wrong judgements, which further improves the practicality. In our experiments, our LSTM-Attention-based method achieves an detection accuracy of 90.4%, which is much better than the method based on LSTM processing sEMG signals only from the target muscle.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549359","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549359.pdf","startPage":"8475","endPage":"8480","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LSTM-Attention-based Method to Muscle Fatigue Detection by Integrating Multi-Source sEMG Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"An LSTM-Attention-based Method to Muscle Fatigue Detection by Integrating Multi-Source sEMG Signals","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9549359/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009950","fundingName":"Ministry of Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LSTM-Attention-based Method to Muscle Fatigue Detection by Integrating Multi-Source sEMG Signals","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072408S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9549368,"authors":[{"name":"Kui Qian","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Qian","id":"37088983969"},{"name":"Lei Tian","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Tian","id":"37088985070"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549368","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Computed tomography","Neural networks","Computer architecture","Feature extraction","Convolutional neural networks","Medical diagnosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ordered pooling","Fusion feature","CNN","Medical image recognition"]}],"abstract":"Aiming at the imbalance problem of Computed Tomography(CT) images diagnosis model under artificial intelligence assisted method, a new ordered pooling network based on multi-scale fusion feature for medical image recognition is proposed.

Multi-scale feature fusion layer upsamples and merges different scale CNN features to achieve multi-scale deep feature fusion. Deep feature ordered pooling layer regards the fusion spatial deep convolution features as a continuous Weisfeiler\u2013Lehman(WL) color, which makes a meaningful ordering to weaken the excessive spatial information feature , and improves the generalization capability.

However, there are still challenges for RUL prediction via multi-sensor data. Therefore, this paper focuses on the RUL prediction problem for complex engineering systems. In order to make full use of multi-sensor monitoring data and enhance prediction accuracy, a feature selection method is developed based on Relief algorithm, then a practical RUL prediction approach is proposed based on deep long and short term memory (LSTM) network in this paper.

The model consists of feature extraction, deep learning network, and optimization algorithm. First, VMD is used to decompose the original data into multiple Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) from low to high frequencies, preserving the variation characteristics of the signal at different frequencies. Second, for each eigenmode function sequence, CNN feature extraction and LSTM prediction are performed in turn. Then, ELM is used to nonlinearly integrate the prediction results of multiple sequences to obtain the final prediction output. Finally, the simulation experimental results based on industrial data show that the proposed VMD-LSTM-ELM based thermal field temperature has excellent prediction performance and generalization ability.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549392","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549392.pdf","startPage":"1322","endPage":"1327","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid integrated modeling of thermal field temperature in Cz silicon single crystal growth process based on VMD-CNN-LSTM-ELM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid integrated modeling of thermal field temperature in Cz silicon single crystal growth process based on VMD-CNN-LSTM-ELM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9549392/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid integrated modeling of thermal field temperature in Cz silicon single crystal growth process based on VMD-CNN-LSTM-ELM","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079832S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9549404,"authors":[{"name":"Renkang Geng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engireening, University of Jinan, Jinan, P.

In this work, we proposed a new method Multi-Sub-Model with Heteroscedasticity (MSM-H) modelling for pre-processing sequence data to get residuals together with EXPected Similarity Estimation (EXPoSE) for detection using the residuals. We compare the proposed pre-processed residuals with two more datasets and compare the detection methods with five more latest and proven effective detection algorithms as the anomaly detector. Experiments are carried out using real-word traffic flow data. It firstly generates multiple small models from the traffic flow sequence data, then adapted the model to the specific data of each day, and finally processed and solves the heteroscedasticity in the data to obtain relatively accurate and reasonable residuals. Anomaly detection on the residuals shows promising results and gives 41% improvement considering Area Under Curve (AUC).","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549404","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549404.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","startPage":"6052","endPage":"6057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Sequence Data Based on MSM-H with EXPoSE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Sequence Data Based on MSM-H with EXPoSE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549404/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9549404/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Sequence Data Based on MSM-H with EXPoSE","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0618S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9549463,"authors":[{"name":"Kang Yang","affiliation":["Special Environment Robot Technology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088985815"},{"name":"Manlu Liu","affiliation":["Special Environment Robot Technology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang"],"firstName":"Manlu","lastName":"Liu","id":"38085352300"},{"name":"Yu Xie","affiliation":["Special Environment Robot Technology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Xie","id":"37088982795"},{"name":"Xinglang Zhang","affiliation":["Special Environment Robot Technology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang"],"firstName":"Xinglang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088984024"},{"name":"Weidong Wang","affiliation":["Special Environment Robot Technology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088985478"},{"name":"Songlin Gou","affiliation":["Special Environment Robot Technology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang"],"firstName":"Songlin","lastName":"Gou","id":"37088986366"},{"name":"Haoxiang Su","affiliation":["Special Environment Robot Technology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang"],"firstName":"Haoxiang","lastName":"Su","id":"37088984506"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549463","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuses","Neural networks","Inertial navigation","Prediction algorithms","Distance measurement","Angular velocity","Indoor environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GA-BP neural network","IMU","UWB"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549463","abstract":"In order to solve the problem of large errors in single positioning technology in complex indoor environments, a positioning fusion method based on GA-BP neural network is proposed.

SEI has been widely adopted in military and civilian use. As for SEI task, in time domain, general neural network has a poor feature extraction ability that usually gets a low recognition accuracy in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. So, we propose a SEI method based on squeeze-and-excitation neural network (SeNet) in frequency domain. SeNet uses a squeeze-and-excitation module to achieve channel attention mechanism, so the neural network can emphasize the useful feature and weaken the useless feature in different channels. The experiment result shows that, in frequency domain, SeNet has better emitter identification ability and stronger robustness than the general neural network even in a low SNR environment.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549470","startPage":"8310","endPage":"8314","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549470.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Specific Emitter Identification via Squeeze-and-Excitation Neural Network in Frequency Domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Frequency-domain analysis","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Robustness","Convolutional neural networks","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["specific emitter identification","frequency domain","squeeze-and-excitation","attention"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Specific Emitter Identification via Squeeze-and-Excitation Neural Network in Frequency Domain","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9549470/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specific Emitter Identification via Squeeze-and-Excitation Neural Network in Frequency Domain","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044845S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9549477,"authors":[{"name":"Xueqi Yao","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, PR China"],"firstName":"Xueqi","lastName":"Yao","id":"37088976233"},{"name":"Shouming Zhong","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, PR China"],"firstName":"Shouming","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37292866500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549477","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549477","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Memristors","Calculus","Synchronization","Cellular neural networks","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","delays","fuzzy neural nets","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","synchronisation","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interval matrix","multiple delayed memristive fractional-order neural networks","Lyapunov function","asymptotic synchronization","multiple delayed fractional-order memristive fuzzy cellular neural network","uncertainties","LMI","exponential synchronization","integer-order systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy cellular neural networks","Fractional-order","Memristor","Multiple delays","interval matrix method"]}],"abstract":"The interval matrix method is applied to multiple delayed memristive fractional-order neural networks with fuzzy cellular concept to achieve synchronization.

In order to predict the content of FeO of ore agglomerate, a data-driven prediction scheme based on multi-source information and long short-term memory (Long Short-Term Memory, LSTM) network is proposed. In the proposed method, the multi-source information is firstly extracted and then they are input to the LSTM, whose target output is the corresponding Reference-FeO. The multi-source information used in this paper includes image, vibration and temperature information. And for the feature extraction of the images, a method is developed to preprocess and extract features from images. Besides, the information of vibration and temperature are selected on account of the correlation analysis and mechanism of sintering. Moreover, the corresponding Reference-FeO at the end of the sintering pallets is obtained as the target output of the LSTM network. Finally, a LSTM network is utilized to predict the target output. The experimental results show that the data-driven prediction scheme using multi-source features can reach a good performance with absolute error within 0.05 and can meet the needs of practical engineering.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549500","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549500.pdf","startPage":"3311","endPage":"3316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Prediction of Sinter Composition Based on Multi-Source Information and LSTM Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Prediction of Sinter Composition Based on Multi-Source Information and LSTM Network","htmlLink":"/document/9549500/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Prediction of Sinter Composition Based on Multi-Source Information and LSTM Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066145S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9549505,"authors":[{"name":"Li Bo","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Research Center of Brain Computer Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Bo","id":"37088378051"},{"name":"Yang Banghua","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Research Center of Brain Computer Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Banghua","id":"38054753300"},{"name":"Gao Shouwei","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Research Center of Brain Computer Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Shouwei","id":"37543140300"},{"name":"LinFeng Yan","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Research Center of Brain Computer Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"LinFeng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37088982853"},{"name":"Haodong Zhuang","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Research Center of Brain Computer Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Haodong","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37088983636"},{"name":"Wen Wang","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Research Center of Brain Computer Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088985936"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549505","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Convolution","Neural networks","Training data","Gesture recognition","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","surface electromyography","gesture recognition"]}],"abstract":"At present, the gesture recognition of surface electromyography (sEMG) is widely used.

But there are predictable difficulties in detecting traffic signs from images or videos from car cameras owing to the next reasons: traffic signs are usually small-sized or medium-sized objects, and there is quantity imbalance between different traffic signs in the existed public data sets. Therefore, two main developments have been proposed in this paper. Firstly, an improved TT-100K-HHU traffic sign data set based on TT-100K is constructed. New images are collected from the Tencent Street View and labeled by Labelme software. Secondly, an improved Mask R-CNN is presented by revising the structure. More specific, feature pyramid network (FPN) is introduced into the backbone network of Mask R-CNN to achieve the fusion of feature maps at multiple scales, which can improve the representation abilities of network for objects with small or medium size. And in the prediction network, multiple cascaded Box Heads are applied to acquire more accurate location predictions and segmentation results. Experimental results show that the performance of the improved Mask R-CNN network is better than the existing algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9549552/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Traffic Signs Detection and Segmentation Based on the Improved Mask R-CNN","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic Signs Detection and Segmentation Based on the Improved Mask R-CNN","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099066S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9549558,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, P.

However, the tradition NLF model in terms of the double factorization (DF) technique is somewhat conservative due to the inadequate consideration of difference cases of NLFs. In order to address this issue, we propose an improved DF-SNLF (IDF-SNLF) model to extract NLF matrices in various scenarios. Meanwhile, single NLF-dependent and multiplicative update (SNL-MU) learning method is employed to build an NLF model on SHiDS matrices, yet it suffers from a fairly low convergence rate. So, for the purpose of accelerating the convergence rate, a so-called momentum-based additive gradient descent (MAGD) method is adopted to train the model. Empirical studies on two SHiDS matrices demonstrate that our proposed IDF-SNLF model with MAGD can obtain a desirable performance on both prediction accuracy for missing data and the algorithm convergence rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Non-negative Latent Factor Model via Momentum-Based Additive Gradient Descent Method","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549558","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549558.pdf","startPage":"3409","endPage":"3414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Non-negative Latent Factor Model via Momentum-Based Additive Gradient Descent Method","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9549558/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007219","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Non-negative Latent Factor Model via Momentum-Based Additive Gradient Descent Method","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098598S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9549568,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Manufacturing in Energy Chemical Process (East China University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Sai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37088982965"},{"name":"Shuhan Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Manufacturing in Energy Chemical Process (East China University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shuhan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088985834"},{"name":"Shumin Ma","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Manufacturing in Energy Chemical Process (East China University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shumin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37088982252"},{"name":"Qi Lu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Manufacturing in Energy Chemical Process (East China University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37088981709"},{"name":"Jun Song","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Manufacturing in Energy Chemical Process (East China University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Song","id":"37085823729"},{"name":"Xiangyun Qing","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Manufacturing in Energy Chemical Process (East China University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyun","lastName":"Qing","id":"37085924643"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549568","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulation","Switches","Observers","Temperature control","Continuous-stirred tank reactor","Inductors","Sliding mode control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized Extended State Observer (GESO)","Sliding Mode Control (SMC)","Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)","Mismatched Disturbances","Genetic Algorithm (GA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549568","abstract":"The paper develops a generalized-extended-state-observer-based sliding mode control (GESO-SMC) approach for temperature stabilization of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with mismatched disturbances.

This method is based on generative adversarial network (GAN), using the improved scale-recurrent network (SRN) as generator and the critic in DeblurGAN as discriminator.

In the proposed algorithm, multiple subpopulations and an inferior population are used to search jointly, which strengthens the utilization of inferior particles and not only improves the efficiency of the algorithm, but also effectively improves the convergence and searching ability of the algorithm. Archive set is used to retain non-dominated paticles to realize information exchange between subpopulations and the inferior population, where non-dominated particles in the archive set are used to replace the inferior particles. Moreover, a strategy to prevent particles from falling into local optima is proposed. Finally, experiment results on ZDTs series functions and comparison with other algorithms are given to validate the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549666.pdf","startPage":"6599","endPage":"6605","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-population Coevolution Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Particle swarm optimization","Statistics","Information exchange","Convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple subpopulations","inferior particles","cooperative","convergence","archive set","ZDTs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-population Coevolution Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9549666/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-population Coevolution Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064359S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9549690,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Huang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088983133"},{"name":"Pingwei Gu","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Pingwei","lastName":"Gu","id":"37088751512"},{"name":"Xuebin Cao","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xuebin","lastName":"Cao","id":"37088986850"},{"name":"Kun Jiang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37088758172"},{"name":"Bin Duan","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Duan","id":"37085864286"},{"name":"Chenghui Zhang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Chenghui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37400243200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549690","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549690","abstract":"State of health of battery is crucial for electric vehicles, which has been widely studied through many different methods where incremental capacity analysis (ICA) is a common method for battery state of health estimation. However, previous methods are difficult to find suitable feature information from multiple features to make the estimation result better, especially considering that the ICA curves of different batteries have different peak numbers and positions. In this paper, in order to acquire accurate peak coordinates, the Gaussian filtering is used to make the incremental capacity (IC) curve smoother, and then the method that using multiple linear regression by particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to solve the problems mentioned above. Compared with the traditional multiple linear regression, multiple linear regression by particle swarm optimization selects the most appropriate variables to improve the accuracy of estimation. In the experiment, a group of peak data of series module of battery is selected for linear regression to get the optimal variables and corresponding parameters, and then the corresponding verification is carried out by using the data of six different aging states of another series module of battery. The experimental results show that except the sixth group of the state of health estimation error is 2.09%, the estimation error of the remaining five groups is less than 2%, so this method has high accuracy and adaptability for series module of battery.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549690","startPage":"5830","endPage":"5835","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549690.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Battery State of Health Estimation Based on Multiple Linear Regression by Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Estimation error","Filtering","Linear regression","Aging","Electric vehicles","Batteries"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["battery","particle swarm optimization","multiple linear regression","state of health","Gaussian filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Battery State of Health Estimation Based on Multiple Linear Regression by Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9549690/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Battery State of Health Estimation Based on Multiple Linear Regression by Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056187S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9549737,"authors":[{"name":"Xianxia Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronics and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xianxia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088983756"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronics and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37088986711"},{"name":"Runbin Yan","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronics and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Runbin","lastName":"Yan","id":"37088984235"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549737","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"A fourier space basis function based 3D fuzzy modeling method for distributed parameter systems is proposed in this paper.

Secondly, an improved Discrete Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (D-SMOTE) is proposed to generate accident samples that are close to discrete values.

Deep learning methods show the advantage of using neural networks to solve complex tasks. The network training speed is highly dependent on the hardware environments and its training methodology. Training a large dataset on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can last for weeks with a limited number of GPUs. Although cloud training is a good method to train large networks within a short time, it is usually costly. What is more, since a good network needs a lot of parameter tunings to get an optimal result, a network needs to train multiple times with different parameter settings. The training speed and the cost for large networks have become a constraint to verify algorithm results when computing resources are limited. Thus, fast training a large network with a limited number of computing resources is needed and challenging, especially for large datasets. In this paper, we propose new fast training methods to accelerate the CNNs training time from the data sampling level. We introduce a flat reduced random sampling strategy and a bottleneck reduced random sampling strategy for deep learning model training. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis for the proposed fast training methods are derived by four theorems and two corollaries to show the properties and benefits of the proposed new methods. The experiments of these fast training methods are run on three image classification datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. The experimental results show that our proposed new training methods can achieve significant training time percentage reduction with a very small accuracy cost correspondingly, i.e., to well provide the fast training method for deep learning CNN models as our theoretical analysis shows and predicts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Costs","Neural networks","Predictive models","Sampling methods","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","sampling","deep learning","fast training","convolutional neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549817","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549817","startPage":"8253","endPage":"8260","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549817.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549817/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Training Methods and Their Experiments for Deep Learning CNN Models","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9549817/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Training Methods and Their Experiments for Deep Learning CNN Models","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080598S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9549886,"authors":[{"name":"Menghua Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Beijing Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Menghua","lastName":"Li","id":"37088984158"},{"name":"Ding Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Beijing Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Wang","id":"37715514300"},{"name":"Junfei Qiao","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Beijing Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junfei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37273179900"},{"name":"Xin Xu","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Beijing Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088555178"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549886","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549886","abstract":"In this paper, we adopt a neural-network-based adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method to solve the disturbance rejection problem for continuous-time nonlinear systems with control constraints. First, we define a suitable function and then derive the optimal control law with control constraints and the worst disturbance law. Besides, the constrained Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation for continuous-time nonlinear constrained systems is derived. Then, only one critic neural network is used to approximate the optimal cost function. Consequently, the approximate optimal control law and the approximate worst disturbance law are obtained. Additionally, a new updating rule is developed in the process of neural critic learning. Finally, the simulation results show that the self-learning optimal control is realized and the effectiveness of the disturbance rejection is verified by using the neural-network-based ADP method.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549886","startPage":"2179","endPage":"2184","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549886.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-Network-Based Self-Learning Disturbance Rejection Design for Continuous-Time Nonlinear Constrained Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Simulation","Neural networks","Optimal control","Cost function","Mathematical models","Dynamic programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimal control","Nonlinear constrained systems","Adaptive dynamic programming","Neural networks","Self-learning disturbance rejection","H\u221e control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Neural-Network-Based Self-Learning Disturbance Rejection Design for Continuous-Time Nonlinear Constrained Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9549886/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-Network-Based Self-Learning Disturbance Rejection Design for Continuous-Time Nonlinear Constrained Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123917S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9549893,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088983721"},{"name":"Min Han","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Optimization for Industrial Equipment of Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Han","id":"37272698100"},{"name":"Jianwei Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Infrastructure Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088983775"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549893","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549893","abstract":"In the field of Web service composition, since the published value of Quality of Service (QoS) is not necessarily reliable, the research on the credibility of Web services has become a research hotspot. However, the current credibility research cannot well describe the difference between the published value and the actual operating value. At the same time, the algorithm used to solve the Web service composition scheme generally has the problem of poor solution effect. Based on this, this paper proposes a credible Web service composition method based on improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO). Firstly, this paper proposes a similarity-based credibility calculation model, and combines it with the QoS published value through the inverse of the similarity, so that the QoS of the Web service meets the actual operation effect. Secondly, this paper proposes an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm, which solves the problem of premature convergence by expanding the population diversity, and the solution effect is significantly improved. Finally, the improved multi-objective particle swarm algorithm is used to solve the Web service composition problem based on credible QoS. Simulation experiments on the QWS_V2 data set and the Synthetic data set prove that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the credibility of the service composition scheme, and has higher composition efficiency and better composition effect.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549893","startPage":"2408","endPage":"2413","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549893.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Credible Web Service Composition based on Improved Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Inverse problems","Sociology","Quality of service","Data models","Reliability","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["credibility","Web service composition","QoS","multi-objective particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Credible Web Service Composition based on Improved Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9549893/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Credible Web Service Composition based on Improved Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099516S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9549903,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Li","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Li","id":"37088983633"},{"name":"Jiayuan Yan","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jiayuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37087050489"},{"name":"Bin Hu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085398086"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549903","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549903","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Epidemics","Image recognition","Robot vision systems","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Recognition","Mask Detection","YOLO"]}],"doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549903","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549903.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","startPage":"4056","endPage":"4061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mask Detection Based On Efficient-YOLO","abstract":"COVID-19 can be transmitted by respiratory droplets and other means.

There are always a large number of matrix operations involved in CS based GPR imaging process, which takes a long time. Traditionally, all scanning area was imaged by this CS imaging method. However, with the imaging scene becoming larger, the measurement matrix and the data dictionary in CS imaging model expand, which increases the time of CS-based imaging process. Thus, this paper proposes a fast CS based GPR imaging method to reduce the imaging time. Specifically, the geometric characteristics of the B-scan image can firstly be used to extract the region of interest (ROI) where the target may exist in a layered medium. Then the GPR imaging based on CS can be realized in ROI, which can reduce the imaging area and imaging time.

Consequently, it generates tremendous amount of telemetry data during its lifetime. If the system information of solar array that contained in the telemetry data can be used to forecast the future state, then the malfunction alarm and in-orbit maintenance can be implemented. At present, research on solar arrays basically focuses on state monitoring and outlier detection, and almost no fault prediction is involved. In this paper, a data-driven faults prediction method for solar array based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and autoencoder (AE) is proposed. This novel fault prediction method works by creating a prediction model using the collected time series. The temporal features of sensor data are captured with LSTM networks, which perform well in extracting the features of time series. The predicted sequence is reconstructed by the identifying model, and the reconstruction error of the input sequence which is used as a health indicator to estimate the states of devices. The data used in verification experiment in this paper is the telemetry data of an orbiting satellite. The experiments show that the proposed method can detect the occurrence of failures several days in advance compared with the traditional method.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549930","startPage":"4567","endPage":"4572","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549930.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Prediction for Solar Array Based on Long Short-Term Memory and Autoencoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549930/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault Prediction for Solar Array Based on Long Short-Term Memory and Autoencoder","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9549930/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Prediction for Solar Array Based on Long Short-Term Memory and Autoencoder","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050174S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9549943,"authors":[{"name":"Shifan Song","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Shifan","lastName":"Song","id":"37088986656"},{"name":"Xuejun Pan","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Xuejun","lastName":"Pan","id":"37088508293"},{"name":"Mingxiang Guo","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Mingxiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37088982508"},{"name":"Qi Lang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Lang","id":"37087015232"},{"name":"Xiaodong Liu","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280587000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549943","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Biological system modeling","Clustering algorithms","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms","Feature extraction","Market research"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Futures Price Prediction","LSTM","Price Patterns","K-means Clustering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549943","abstract":"Forecasting of futures price is of great significance to the research of financial products and the formulation of trading strategies. Compared with traditional econometric models, deep learning algorithm has outstanding advantages in the application of the financial field by virtue of its excellent nonlinear information processing ability. But few existing studies take long-term price patterns as input characteristics, so this paper proposes a novel deep learning model fusing long-term price model features to predict the closing price of futures. The clustering algorithm is served to extract features of long-term price patterns, and the deep learning component selects associated LSTM. Finally, the experimental results on several products in the Chinese futures market show that our method achieves better forecasting performance than other similar methods.","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549943","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549943.pdf","startPage":"8193","endPage":"8198","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Futures Price Forecasting Based on the Feature Fusion LSTM Model Using Long-Term Price Patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Futures Price Forecasting Based on the Feature Fusion LSTM Model Using Long-Term Price Patterns","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9549943/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Futures Price Forecasting Based on the Feature Fusion LSTM Model Using Long-Term Price Patterns","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129585S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9549980,"authors":[{"name":"Dandan Tang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Process Control for Light Industry, Ministry of Education Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Dandan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37088982435"},{"name":"Dinghui Wu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Process Control for Light Industry, Ministry of Education Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Dinghui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37088981296"},{"name":"Shenxin Lu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Process Control for Light Industry, Ministry of Education Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Shenxin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37088985119"},{"name":"Ruijie Ma","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Process Control for Light Industry, Ministry of Education Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Ruijie","lastName":"Ma","id":"37088984541"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549980","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"In view of the problem that the traditional rolling bearing fault diagnosis method needs to extract the characteristics artificially, take a long time and have low diagnostic accuracy, this paper puts forward a bearing fault diagnosis method based on edge computing. Cloud data is employed to train the convolutional neural network in order to get the cloud model. The feature extraction layer of cloud model is migrated to edge end to get edge end fault diagnosis model. The experimental results show that when the number of fault samples is only 20, the fault diagnosis model at the edge end will have 96.4% accuracy, and the fault diagnosis time will be reduced by 5.96, which meets the high precision and real-time requirements of rolling bearing fault diagnosis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9549237/9549238/09549980.pdf","startPage":"8469","endPage":"8474","publicationTitle":"2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doi":"10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9549980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9549238","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearing Based on Edge Calculation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Computational modeling","Transfer learning","Rolling bearings","Feature extraction","Real-time systems","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Convolutional Neural Networks","Edge Computing","Transfer Learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9549980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearing Based on Edge Calculation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9549980/","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearing Based on Edge Calculation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149622S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9549237","isNumber":"9549238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9549237","xplore-issue":"9549238","articleId":"9549980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9549995,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Liu","affiliation":["College of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088985140"},{"name":"Hongjian Wang","affiliation":["College of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Hongjian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37075193700"},{"name":"Kai Zhang","affiliation":["College of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088985477"},{"name":"Jingfei Ren","affiliation":["College of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jingfei","lastName":"Ren","id":"37088984800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6380-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1195-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"9549995","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Adaptation models","Analytical models","Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UUV","Trajectory prediction","GRU neural networks","Time characteristics","Recurrent neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9549995","abstract":"Aiming at the problems of large simplification and low accuracy of traditional trajectory prediction models, combined with the characteristics of time sequence, continuity, and interactivity of UUV trajectories, an unknown UUV trajectory prediction method based on a gated unit recursive (GRU) neural network model is proposed.
