They examine the projection of the data onto the noise subspace. The conditional probability density function (PDF) of the projected data given the signal parameters and the unknown projected noise covariance matrix is first formed. The a posteriori PDF of the signal parameters alone is then obtained by assigning a noninformative a priori PDF to the unknown noise covariance matrix and integrating out this quantity. A simple criterion for the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the DOAs of the signals is established. Some properties of this criterion are discussed, and an efficient numerical algorithm for the implementation of this criterion is developed. The advantage of this method is that the noise covariance matrix does not have to be known, nor must it be estimated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3966/00150002.pdf","startPage":"2007","endPage":"2017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.150002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.150002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of the directions of arrival of signals in unknown correlated noise.

The TDF output data can be obtained by summing the outputs of each product block.

A parametrized stochastic model for the array uncertainties is introduced. The unknown array parameters can include the individual gain and phase responses of the sensors as well as their positions. Based on this model, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator is formulated. This results in a fairly complex optimization problem which is computationally expensive. The MAP estimator is simplified by exploiting properties of the weighted subspace fitting method. An approximate method that further reduces the complexity is also presented, assuming small array perturbations. A compact expression for the MAP Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on the signal and array parameter estimates is derived. A simulation study indicates that the proposed robust estimation procedures achieve the MAP-CRB even for moderate sample sizes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150153.pdf","endPage":"3280 vol.5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust signal parameter estimation in the presence of array perturbations","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150153","startPage":"3277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"Robust signal parameter estimation in the presence of array perturbations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150153/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4194389","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust signal parameter estimation in the presence of array perturbations","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028513S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"37","articleId":"150153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":150176,"authors":[{"name":"B.C.

The results confirm that the proposed concept deals successfully with teleconferencing environments and that it yields substantially better performance than earlier concepts based on analog hardware.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","startPage":"3581","endPage":"3584 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150249.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-steering digital microphone array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"A self-steering digital microphone array","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4189120","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-steering digital microphone array","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022116S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"59","articleId":"150249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":150251,"authors":[{"name":"F.X.Y.

In addition, it is found that most self-recurrent connections become excitatory and most mutual recurrent connections become inhibitory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150282/","accessionNumber":"4155135","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of fully recurrent neural networks for speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of fully recurrent neural networks for speech recognition","confLoc":"Toronto, Ontario, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089048S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"4","articleId":"150282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":150283,"authors":[{"name":"F.

These were extracted from an initial and intermediate position in a list of the most common Italian words, uttered by a male speaker, thus obtaining 250 tokens per phoneme. The training was carried out through a modified variant of back propagation, known as BPS (back propagation for sequences), using half of the tokens for learning and the remaining for the test.

The Tempo 2 algorithm is proposed. It is a training algorithm for neural networks that trains the temporal parameters of the network (delays and widths of the input windows) as well as the weights. A comparison of the performances with one adaptive parameter set (either weights, delays or widths) shows that the main parameters are the weights. Delays and widths seem to be of lesser importance, but in combination with the weights the temporal parameters can improve performance, especially generalization. A Tempo 2 network with trained delays and widths and random weights can classify 70% of the phonemes correctly. The application to phoneme classification, shows that this adaptive architecture can approach the performance of a carefully hand-tuned TDNN (time-delay neural network) and leads to more compact networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150292/","accessionNumber":"4155145","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning the architecture of neural networks for speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning the architecture of neural networks for speech recognition","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074315S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"5","articleId":"150292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":150293,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The authors propose nonlinear vector interpolation techniques to represent this correlation and to recognize phonemes. The interpolation is based on the decomposition of a frame sequence into two parts and on the construction of a function that interpolates one part using information from the second part. According to quantities to be interpolated, three families of interpolator models are developed. In a recognition system, each phonemic symbol is associated with a nonlinear vector interpolator which is trained to give minimum interpolation error for that specific phoneme. Multilayer feedforward neural networks are used to implement the nonlinear vector interpolators. For continuous speech under the phoneme spotting test using 16 PLCC-derived cepstrum coefficients as parametric vectors, the three categories of models gave compatible results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150293","startPage":"121","endPage":"124 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150293.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-linear vector interpolation by neural network for phoneme identification in continuous speech","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Speech analysis","Speech recognition","Predictive models","Vectors","Artificial neural networks","Mathematical model","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","decoding","interpolation","neural nets","speech analysis and processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear vector interpolation","speech decoding","frame sequence decomposition","multilayer feedforward neural networks","phoneme identification","continuous speech","correlations","analysis frames","phonetic units","acoustic-phonetic decoding","interpolator models","recognition system","phonemic symbol","minimum interpolation error","phoneme spotting test","PLCC-derived cepstrum coefficients","parametric vectors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"Non-linear vector interpolation by neural network for phoneme identification in continuous speech","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","accessionNumber":"4155146","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-linear vector interpolation by neural network for phoneme identification in continuous speech","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046543S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"4","articleId":"150293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":150294,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Phonemes in Japanese have certain rough temporal structures which do not greatly change even when the utterance is an isolated word or continuous speech. Thus, if the neural network is to treat this, it would be very helpful to be able to identify phonemes whatever the utterance. The proposed TSNNs are able to deal with the temporal structure of phonemic features. Several types of TSNNs are described along with their phoneme identification performance, tested on the Japanese phonemes /b,d,g,m,n,N/ taken from isolated word, phrase, and sentence utterances. The phoneme identification performance of the TSNNs was much better than that of conventional TDNNs, especially in the case of continuous speech.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150294","startPage":"125","endPage":"128 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150294.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-state neural networks (TSNN) for phoneme identification by considering temporal structure of phonemic features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150294/","displayDocTitle":"Time-state neural networks (TSNN) for phoneme identification by considering temporal structure of phonemic features","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4155147","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-state neural networks (TSNN) for phoneme identification by considering temporal structure of phonemic features","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033212S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"2","articleId":"150294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":150298,"authors":[{"name":"L.

A stochastic codebook of innovations is selected for the simulations. Simulations demonstrate that the density function for the amplitude of an innovation vector is distinctly bimodal. In an analogy to coding of Gaussian vectors, it is shown that this property is in agreement with classical VQ theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Technological innovation","Filters","Speech coding","Speech analysis","Speech synthesis","Signal generators","Books","Filtering theory","Information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","filtering and prediction theory","speech analysis and processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude quantisation","speech coding","CELP excitation signals","code excited linear prediction","LTP coding","vector quantization","simulations","innovation gain","stochastic codebook","density function","innovation vector","VQ theory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150318","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150318.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"228 vol. 1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude quantization for CELP excitation signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude quantization for CELP excitation signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150318/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4160172","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude quantization for CELP excitation signals","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029437S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"3","articleId":"150318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":150329,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A useful operating point in a speaker-dependent paradigm is defined at 71% detection rate and 1% false alarm rate. The authors present a novel technique for obtaining a phonetic transcription for a new word, which is needed to add the new word to the system. The technique utilizes DECtalk's text-to-sound rules to obtain an initial phonetic transcription for the new word. Since these text-to-sound rules are imperfect, a probabilistic transformation technique is used that produces a phonetic pronunciation network of all possible pronunciations given DECtalk's transcription. The network is used to constrain a phonetic recognition process that results in an improved phonetic transcription for the new word. The resulting transcriptions are sufficient for speech recognition purposes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Vocabulary","Acoustic signal detection","Resource management","Testing","Automatic speech recognition","Dictionaries","Trademarks","Detection algorithms","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker dependent recognition","speaker independent recognition","large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition","detection rate","false alarm rate","phonetic transcription","DECtalk's text-to-sound rules","probabilistic transformation","phonetic pronunciation network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150337","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150337.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"308 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic modeling for adding new words to a large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic modeling for adding new words to a large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150337/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4155167","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic modeling for adding new words to a large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition system","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064253S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"21","articleId":"150337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":150338,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

The keyword spotter uses a conventional dynamic time warping algorithm to detect the start- and end-point of each potential keyword. The ANNs serve as a secondary processing stage for this segmented utterance. The ANNs attempt to classify this utterance by formulating the recognition problem as a pattern matching problem. In the hybrid network experiments, the utterance was processed into features derived from the activation at the hidden layer of a back-propagation trained network. Hybrid representations were grouped with two other feature representations in a multiple neural network system. A recognition accuracy of 78% on the Stonehenge X database was obtained while rejecting 72% of the false alarms which were detected by the primary keyword spotting system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150339","startPage":"313","endPage":"316 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150339.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple neural network topologies applied to keyword spotting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150339/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple neural network topologies applied to keyword spotting","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4155169","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple neural network topologies applied to keyword spotting","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038175S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"8","articleId":"150339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":150343,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

There were initial difficulties caused by the use of mixture pruning but these were cured by using observation pruning. Fixed weight smoothing of the mixture weights allowed the use of word-boundary-context-dependent triphone models for both speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) recognition. A second-differential observation stream further improved SI performance but not SD performance. A novel form of phonetic context model, the semiphone, is also introduced. This model significantly reduces the number of states required to model a vocabulary and unifies triphone and diphone modeling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150343","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150343.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","startPage":"329","endPage":"332 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Lincoln tied-mixture HMM continuous speech recognizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Lincoln tied-mixture HMM continuous speech recognizer","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150343/","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4155173","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Lincoln tied-mixture HMM continuous speech recognizer","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035602S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"14","articleId":"150343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":150344,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The binary pair classifier has been applied to a speaker identification problem using neural networks for the binary classifiers. The binary partitioned approach was used to develop an identification system for the 47 male speakers belonging to the Northern dialect region of the TIMIT database. The system performs with 100% accuracy in a text-independent mode when trained with about 9 to 14 s of speech and tested with 8 s of speech. The partitioned approach performs comparably, or even better, than a single large neural network. For large values of N (>10), the partitioned approach requires only a fraction of the training time required for a single large network. For N=47, the training time for the partitioned network would be about two orders of magnitude less than for the single large network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150358","startPage":"389","endPage":"392 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150358.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Text-independent talker identification with neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150358/","displayDocTitle":"Text-independent talker identification with neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4155188","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Text-independent talker identification with neural networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039452S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"32","articleId":"150358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":150360,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

One of these Markov models is speaker-specific, being built from utterances from the speaker whose identity is to be verified. The second model is built from utterances from a large population of speakers. The performance of the system is improved by treating the pair of models as a connectionist network, an alpha-net, which then allows discriminative training to be carried out. Experimental results show that adapting the spectral observation probabilities of each state of the model by the back propagation of errors can correct misclassification errors. The real-time implementation of the system produced an average digit error rate of 4.5% and only one misclassification in 600 trials using a five-digit sequence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150360","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150360.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","startPage":"397","endPage":"400 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A speaker verification system using alpha-nets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A speaker verification system using alpha-nets","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150360/","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4155190","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A speaker verification system using alpha-nets","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108532S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"30","articleId":"150360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":150373,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is shown that the states of the HMM can be classified in terms of a set of broad phonetic classes and that the spectra associated with the states are related to each state's use in the phonetic models. The phonetic models are shown to have internal structures reflecting the acoustic nature of the individual phonemes. The large HMMs used in this study are trained using the continuous speech multi-speaker TIMIT database employing a continuous observation density training algorithm.

It is shown that, for any hidden Markov model (HMM), the difference between the approximate and the exact normalized likelihood functions cannot exceed the logarithm of the number of states divided by the dimension of the output vectors (frame length). Furthermore, for Gaussian HMMs and a given observation sequence, the MLSS is typically the sequence of nearest-neighbor states in the Itakura-Saito sense, and the posterior probability of any state sequence which departs from the MLSS in a single time instant decays exponentially with the frame length.

As the number of hidden units was increased, the generalization capabilities of the neural net decreased.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150391","startPage":"521","endPage":"523 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150391.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust real-time pitch detector based on neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150391/","displayDocTitle":"A robust real-time pitch detector based on neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4155221","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust real-time pitch detector based on neural networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02821S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"1","articleId":"150391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":150394,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In addition, the concept of radial basis functions is interpreted as an approximation to class-conditional probability density functions. From this point of view, continuous mixture densities are considered to be a special kind of radial basis function. Experimental tests were performed on the TI/NIST digit string database.

Various neural network based techniques for generating the input vectors via system training are studied. The variations are centered around a neural net vector quantization (NNVQ) method which combines the well-known conventional Linde, Buzo and Gray (1980) (LBG) technique and the neural net based Kohonen (1984) technique. Sequential and parallel learning techniques for designing efficient NNVQs are given. The schemes presented require less computation time due to a new modified gain formula, partial/zero neighbor updating, and parallel learning of the code vectors. Using Gaussian-Markov source and speech signal benchmarks, it is shown that these new approaches lead to distortion as good as or better than that obtained using the LBG and Kohonen approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150420/","accessionNumber":"4160200","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network vector quantizer design using sequential and parallel learning techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network vector quantizer design using sequential and parallel learning techniques","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061527S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"3","articleId":"150420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":150422,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

In the present work, a split vector quantization approach is used to overcome the complexity problem. The LPC vector, consisting of ten line spectral frequencies (LSFs), is divided into two parts and each part is quantized separately using vector quantization. Using the localized spectral sensitivity property of the LSF parameters, a weighted LSF distance measure is proposed. Using this distance measure, it is shown that the split vector quantizer can quantize LPC information in 24 b/frame with 1-dB average spectral distortion and <2% outlier frames (having spectral distortion greater than 2 dB).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150426.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"664 vol. 1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient vector quantization of LPC parameters at 24 bits/frame","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Linear predictive coding","Bit rate","Speech coding","Speech analysis","Speech processing","Frequency","Impedance","Weight measurement","Nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","encoding","filtering and prediction theory","speech analysis and processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech coding","LPC parameters","linear predictive coding","split vector quantization","LPC vector","line spectral frequencies","LSF parameters","weighted LSF distance measure","average spectral distortion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"Efficient vector quantization of LPC parameters at 24 bits/frame","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4160206","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient vector quantization of LPC parameters at 24 bits/frame","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032791S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"105","articleId":"150426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":150436,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Then a backward A* algorithm based tree search is used to extend partial paths time asynchronously. Extended partial paths in the backward tree search are rank ordered in a stack by their corresponding best possible scores of the remaining paths which are prerecorded in the forward trellis path map. In each path growing cycle, the current best partial path, which is at the top of the stack, is extended by the best possible one arc (word) extension.

Based on the idea of making use of high plausibility regions to reduce the computational load while maintaining optimality, the method finds the most plausible sentences relating to the input speech. Two optimization procedures are defined to deal with the following embedded search processes: (1) finding the best path connecting peaks of the plausibility functions of two successive symbols, and (2) finding the best time transition slot index for two given peaks. Experimental results show that the method gives better recognition precision while requiring about 1/20 of the computing time of the traditional DP-based methods.

It is shown that by choosing the proper input representation, the feedforward network is also capable of learning this mapping.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150450/","accessionNumber":"4155254","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Phonetic to acoustic mapping using recurrent neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phonetic to acoustic mapping using recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038747S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"3","articleId":"150450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":150460,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A simple triclass Markov model is used, and the best way to estimate the parameters of this model, depending on the kind and amount of training data that is provided, is found. Two approaches are compared: the use of text that has been tagged by hand and comparing relative frequency counts; and use text without tags and training the model as a hidden Markov process, according to a maximum likelihood principle. Experiments show that the best training is obtained by using as much tagged text as is available, a maximum likelihood training may improve the accuracy of the tagging.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150460","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150460.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"812 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tagging text with a probabilistic model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150460/","displayDocTitle":"Tagging text with a probabilistic model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4155268","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tagging text with a probabilistic model","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047107S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"16","articleId":"150460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":150475,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

The authors' approach to speaker adaptation is to use multivariate parameter estimation procedures to update the mean values of the component densities which comprise the system's codebook, given the speaker-specific observations. The authors have developed a least mean square (LMS) algorithm which produces a faster rate of convergence than the Bayesian estimator, at the expense of a finite misadjustment. This estimate is similar in form to an LMS transversal filter, and is computationally more efficient than the Bayesian estimate. Results show an overall reduction of 2.0 to 3.4% in word error rate due to adaptation for a set of 11 speakers from the DARPA resource management task.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4155282","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speaker adaptation in continuous speech recognition via estimation of correlated mean vectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker adaptation in continuous speech recognition via estimation of correlated mean vectors","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023444S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"11","articleId":"150475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":150476,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

When used with a closed set of speakers, the combination is capable of automatically producing speech and speaker identification. For an open set of speakers, the speaker recognition system acts as speaker quantizer which associates the unknown speaker with an acoustically similar speaker. The matching speaker's word models are used in the speech recognizer. The application of this front-end speaker recognizer is described for a DTW and HMM speech recognizer.

As a result, it was confirmed that the codebook mapping technique has the ability to reduce some noise. Next, the methods were tested on a phoneme recognition task for /b, d, g/ using HMMs in actual computer room noise.

It is based on selectively rejecting outliers arising from noise spikes; therefore, this method can avoid the bias of parameters estimation due to some large noise perturbations. Unlike a sliding fixed-window scheme, this windowing scheme can be noncontinuous. It depends on the estimated level of observed errors (residual). By monitoring the residuals in a recursive manner, one can effectively remove those spurious observed data by downdating them. The proposed scheme is useful, especially when some short-time large interferences perturb the system occasionally. In this respect, it outperforms existing schemes, either exponentially growing or sliding window.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150513","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1012 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150513.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Resonance light scattering","Computerized monitoring","Computer simulation","Computer errors","Noise robustness","Recursive estimation","Parameter estimation","Interference","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RS estimation","residual outliers rejection","recursive least squares estimation","noise spikes","noise perturbations","observed errors","short-time large interferences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A residual-based selective window for robust recursive least squares estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150513/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4160243","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 April 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A residual-based selective window for robust recursive least squares estimation","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059171S","chronDate":"14-17 April 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","articleId":"150513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":150517,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is the extension of the GSVD (generalized singular value decomposition) concept to the case of random processes (much like principal component analysis extends SVD for stochastic signals). In the random signal case, OPC analysis is equivalent to matched filtering and can be found useful in many classification and detection applications. The authors propose a corresponding neural model equipped with an efficient training algorithm for estimating the oriented principal component of two stochastic processes without assuming explicit knowledge of their statistics. The algorithm is based on the (normalized) learning rule proposed by Hebb for training the synaptic weights of a network of neurons. Both the theoretical justification and the numerical performance are shown, giving an explicit estimate of the learning rate parameter for best convergence speed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Singular value decomposition","Random processes","Principal component analysis","Signal processing","Signal analysis","Matched filters","Filtering","Statistics","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","neural nets","pattern recognition","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hebb normalised training rule","pattern classification","pattern recognition","unsupervised neural model","oriented principal component extraction","GSVD","generalized singular value decomposition","random processes","stochastic signals","random signal","matched filtering","training algorithm","stochastic processes","synaptic weights","neurons","numerical performance","learning rate parameter","convergence speed"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150528","startPage":"1049","endPage":"1052 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150528.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unsupervised neural model for oriented principal component extraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An unsupervised neural model for oriented principal component extraction","accessionNumber":"4160253","publicationDate":"1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unsupervised neural model for oriented principal component extraction","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027779S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"7","articleId":"150528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":150532,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

To reduce the synaptic weights, the authors replace the original weight matrix by a product of two smaller matrices so that the number of multiplications required can be reduced. To reduce the hidden units, they exploit the correlation among the outputs of the hidden neurons in the same layer. A method to identify and remove redundant hidden units and update the weights of the remaining neurons is proposed. This approach offers potentially good performance without retraining. When retraining is applied to fine-tune the reduced network, the updated weights become very good initial conditions enabling much faster training compared with training with random initial conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150536","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1064 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150536.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structural simplification of a feed-forward, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150536/","displayDocTitle":"Structural simplification of a feed-forward, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4160256","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural simplification of a feed-forward, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027843S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"8","articleId":"150536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":150537,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The time needed to produce a complete N-point transform equals the time of N elementary computing steps. The initial delay is proportional to log/sub 2/ N. The signal-to-noise ratio is similar to that of the FFT algorithm. All the required communications are local, and the dataflow is unidirectional. As the necessary rotations are known in advance and fixed, the hardware complexity of the CORDIC elements can be minimized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150547","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150547.pdf","startPage":"1569","endPage":"1572 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully pipelined, high speed DFT architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fully pipelined, high speed DFT architecture","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4169173","publicationDate":"1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150547/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully pipelined, high speed DFT architecture","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036764S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"3","articleId":"150547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":150551,"authors":[{"name":"H.-D.

Separate algorithms are used to design the minimum-phase and the all-pass part, and these algorithms are carried out alternately. The approximation method results in filters with equiripple amplitude both in the passband and the stopband while the phase characteristic is equiripple with respect to a linear phase.

An important attribute of the technique is that the frequency locations u/sub i/, i=0, 1, 2, . . ., t need not be equally spaced around the unit circle. The initial estimates of the denominator coefficients of the model system function H(z) are obtained by using an iterative algorithm. Starting from these initial estimates, a Newton-Raphson gradient technique is used to reach a minimum of the error criterion. The numerator polynomial coefficients are subsequently obtained by solving another set of linear equations.

Although the PDFs are derived on the basis of a large-sample theory, computer results show that they work quite well even for small samples; this is important to some applications such as radar.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150614","startPage":"1685","endPage":"1688 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150614.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample distributions of the partial correlation coefficients of a complex autoregressive process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"Sample distributions of the partial correlation coefficients of a complex autoregressive process","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4164724","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150614/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample distributions of the partial correlation coefficients of a complex autoregressive process","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021502S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"1","articleId":"150614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":150616,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

Synthesis is accommodated with multiple implementation styles to reduce overall hardware costs; systematic synthesis of such architectures has not been explored so far.

For a given set of valid prefilters, there is a family of possible postfilters which allows exact recovery of the input, rather than one choice, as in the standard case. It is shown that, if the samples are corrupted by additive white random noise sequence values, the extra flexibility of the postfilters can be used to select an optimal choice that minimizes the reconstruction noise power.

This problem can be viewed as that of recovery from signal drop-outs (missing samples over an interval of time), with the extrapolated signal constrained to lie outside the clipping interval during the drop out. If the signal is oversampled, and the clipping threshold moderate, a unique reconstruction often results from application of signal matching and bandwidth constraints. More generally, however, candidate reconstructions are seen to lie on or inside a polyhedron in the space of sampled signals. In contrast to the case of extrapolation through missing samples, upper and lower limits typically can be placed on the reconstructed signal at every sample point. In light of this finding, methods for choosing a unique reconstruction are discussed. Finally, the case of noise is considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restoring a clipped signal","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150655","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150655.pdf","startPage":"1745","endPage":"1748 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"Restoring a clipped signal","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4164739","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restoring a clipped signal","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03468S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"36","articleId":"150655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":150670,"authors":[{"name":"C.

To alleviate both the perturbation and sample data problems, a novel approach is proposed-projecting the nominal steering vector onto the signal-plus-interference subspace to obtain a new steering constraint. Analysis suggests that the problems of perturbation error and insufficient data are closely related.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150680","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150680.pdf","startPage":"1381","endPage":"1384 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constraint projection approach for robust adaptive beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150680/","displayDocTitle":"A constraint projection approach for robust adaptive beamforming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4164698","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A constraint projection approach for robust adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150680.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035428S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"32","articleId":"150680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":150683,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In practice, outliers occur due to malfunctioning of sensors or as a consequence of strong impulsive noise. The performance of beamformers based on maximum likelihood or minimum mean square error type criteria is seriously degraded by outliers. One solution to combat this would be to optimally detect the failed sensors and the presence of impulses. The complexity of this direct solution increases exponentially with the number of array sensors and time samples. The authors propose an alternative method that models outliers as impulsive noise and detects impulses by using the residue of l/sub 1/ beamformer.

The main innovation of this architecture is that it allows a single chip to selectively perform decimation or interpolation filtering with selectable conversion ratios of 2/sup 1/,2/sup 2/,. . .2/sup N/. The key feature of the proposed architecture is that a single decimate/interpolate-by-two half-band digital filter is used as the computational engine, and the output samples are simply recycled through the same filter after each decimation/interpolation stage for further filtering. A delicate timing allocation scheme for this half-band filter to be shared among each decimation/interpolation stage plays a critical role in allowing the filter to have selectable conversion ratios and still accommodate throughput rates in excess of 100 MHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150697.pdf","startPage":"1813","endPage":"1816 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI architecture for a universal high-speed multirate FIR digital filter with selectable power-of-two decimation/interpolation ratios","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150697","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI architecture for a universal high-speed multirate FIR digital filter with selectable power-of-two decimation/interpolation ratios","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4169184","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI architecture for a universal high-speed multirate FIR digital filter with selectable power-of-two decimation/interpolation ratios","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028962S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"8","articleId":"150697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":150698,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Recently, S.D. Silverstein et al, (1991) presented a subband parallel scheme, which reduced the computation time from O(M/sup 3/) to O(L/sup 3/), where L(<M) is the subband length or the beamspace dimension. However, the potential problem is that a uniform linear array commonly used in direction finding loses its displacement invariance structure after the beamspace transformation. Thus, the DOA estimation may be more computationally intensive since the computationally efficient ESPRIT algorithm cannot be applied directly. The authors show a way of restoring the lost structure, which results in a new beamspace ESPRIT algorithm. The asymptotic performance analysis and simulation results of the beamspace ESPRIT method are presented.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150731","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150731.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","startPage":"1497","endPage":"1500 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel implementation and performance analysis of beamspace ESPRIT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel implementation and performance analysis of beamspace ESPRIT","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150731/","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4169155","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel implementation and performance analysis of beamspace ESPRIT","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066524S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"10","articleId":"150731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":150745,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This scheme involves two steps. A biorthogonal wavelet transform is applied to the original image, and wavelet coefficients are then vector quantized using the LBG (Linde, Buzo and Gray, 1980) method. The purpose of this work is to propose a new scheme for vector quantization of wavelet coefficients. The proposed method is based on lattice vector quantization. The application of the D/sub 4/, E/sub 8/ and Barnes-Wall Lambda /sub 16/ lattices is investigated. These lattices are used to encode wavelet coefficients whose PDFs are close to Laplacian. A variable-length coding method is applied and the trade-off between distortion and optimal rate is investigated. Experimental results on the Lena image using the Lambda /sub 16/ lattice leads to a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 31.14 dB at 0.08 bpp. This result outperforms, to the authors knowledge, all other methods. Edges which are most of interest for image analysis are particularly sharp without any smoothing artefacts.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150745","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150745.pdf","startPage":"2273","endPage":"2276 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image coding using lattice vector quantization of wavelet coefficients","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150745/","displayDocTitle":"Image coding using lattice vector quantization of wavelet coefficients","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4173972","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image coding using lattice vector quantization of wavelet coefficients","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034651S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"35","articleId":"150745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":150750,"authors":[{"name":"H.O.

It was observed that the ratio of the crosstalk energy to the main received energy is not a very good measure of the system performance and the reconstructed signal suffers from crosstalk more than indicated by this ratio when the sampling error is increased.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4169207","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling error analysis in perfect reconstruction transmultiplexers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling error analysis in perfect reconstruction transmultiplexers","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150750.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027969S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","articleId":"150750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":150785,"authors":[{"name":"T.Q.

This method is based on a recursive biorthogonal wavelet transform which relates the digital filter to a continuous analysis function, the so-called wavelet. In biorthogonal wavelet analysis, there is a high-pass filter corresponding to the wavelet and a low-pass filter corresponding to the scaling function. The new idea is to compute optimal edge detection filters which yield multiresolution analysis (continuous wavelet). The high-pass filter (infinite impulse filter) is chosen in order to have first derivative properties. The family of low-pass filters is deduced from the high-pass filter using wavelet transform theory relations. The detection filters are proposed as a trade-off between detection, localization and regularity criteria.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150922","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150922.pdf","startPage":"2553","endPage":"2556 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge detection using recursive biorthogonal wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150922/","displayDocTitle":"Edge detection using recursive biorthogonal wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4178756","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge detection using recursive biorthogonal wavelet transform","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072316S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"4","articleId":"150922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":150939,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

For 3DTV image sequence analysis and transmission, it is possible to jointly estimate in a coherent fashion two apparent motion vector fields subject to stereoscopic constraints. Locally, initial image data are grouped within two views (the left and right ones) at two successive time samples and spatiotemporal coherence has to be used to enhance motion vector field estimation. Several levels of coherence have been tested. The most promising approach, which consists in a joined stereoscopic motion estimation subject to motion and disparity constraints, is emphasized. Finally, results are shown on real stereoscopic 3D TV image sequences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150995","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00150995.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.150995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","startPage":"2845","endPage":"2848 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent disparity and motion compensation in 3DTV image sequence coding schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coherent disparity and motion compensation in 3DTV image sequence coding schemes","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/150995/","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4194331","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent disparity and motion compensation in 3DTV image sequence coding schemes","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00150995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058244S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","citationCount":"9","articleId":"150995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":151000,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The MLMS is a modification of the LMS algorithm designed to protect the adaptive filter coefficients from the effects of impulsive noise. A modified MLMS-ADPCM system is proposed in which the MLMS replaces the LMS in the predictor updates. Objective SNR-based performance measures are used to compare MLMS with LMS in the context of a 32 kb/s system. It is shown that for ideal channels the performance of the MLMS-ADPCM is comparable to that of the conventional LMS-ADPCM. Using independent bit errors, it is shown that when the channel is degraded, MLMS outperforms LMS and appears to obviate the need for coefficient leakage in the predictor update.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1991.151071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1991.151071","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP 91: 1991 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/540/3969/00151071.pdf","startPage":"3665","endPage":"3668 vol.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/151071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"The application of the median LMS algorithm to ADPCM systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 April 1991","accessionNumber":"4189141","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of the median LMS algorithm to ADPCM systems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00151071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022745S","chronDate":"14-17 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"540","articleId":"151071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":151092,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Motivated by real mechanical systems, the authors consider a general representation of interconnections when the strength of the interconnections is bounded by a pth-order polynomial in states. This is in contrast to other studies which have made simpler assumptions about the strength of the interconnections. The authors investigate several scenarios as the control computations become more distributed until the controllers are completely decentralized. The possible bound of the interconnections is assumed to be known for the decentralized semiadaptive controller. Without the knowledge of these bounds, two adaptive controllers are designed: a decentralized adaptive controller with partially centralized compensation and a fully adaptive decentralized controller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.151092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/3970/00151092.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.151092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3970","startPage":"1106","endPage":"1118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized adaptive controller design for large-scale systems with higher order interconnections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=151092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized adaptive controller design for large-scale systems with higher order interconnections","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/151092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4261591","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized adaptive controller design for large-scale systems with higher order interconnections","sourcePdf":"151092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077076S","chronDate":"Aug.  1992","isNumber":"3970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"234","articleId":"151092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":151105,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-W.

The proposed measures are directly related to frequency-domain characteristics such as zeros and residues, and to time-domain characteristics such as eigenvectors, controllability and observability Gramians and eigenvalue sensitivity. A simple and computationally efficient formula involving a quadratic form in the input (output) matrix and the left (right) eigenvector is presented for the calculation of controllability (observability) measure. For systems with repeated eigenvalues, the measures are shown to be proportional to the distances of transmission zeros of certain subsystems and the eigenvalues.

Simple examples are provided which clearly illustrate the advantageous performance compared to linear equivalents.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1991 Sixth International Conference on Digital Processing of Signals in Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3983","pdfPath":"/iel3/1207/3983/00151891.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 Sixth International Conference on Digital Processing of Signals in Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Digital communication","Equalizers","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","digital communication systems","equalisers","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear adaptive equalisation","digital communications equalisation","classification problem","multilayer perceptron","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear adaptive equalisation (multilayer perceptron)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/151891/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4038887","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sep 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear adaptive equalisation (multilayer perceptron)","confLoc":"Loughborough, UK","sourcePdf":"00151891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045879S","chronDate":"2-6 Sep 1991","isNumber":"3983","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1207","citationCount":"2","articleId":"151891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":151893,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is aimed at improving or even replacing existing volts-per-hertz (V/f) open-loop variable-speed drives. This strategy generates d-q voltage commands in the stator-flux-oriented reference frame by closing a torque loop and a flux loop. Stator flux and electromagnetic torque feedback signals are derived from DC voltage, DC current, and inverter switching states. Digital implementation is seen to be possible with slight modification of existing V/f drives. Satisfactory performance was achieved on a prototype. The proposed strategy appears to be a good compromise between high-cost, high-performance field-oriented drives and low-cost, low-performance V/f drives.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1990 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/497/3988/00152218.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"415 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1990 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1990.152218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1990.152218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3988","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=152218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low cost stator flux oriented voltage source variable speed drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Stators","Voltage","Variable speed drives","Pulse width modulation inverters","Torque control","Open loop systems","Acceleration","Phase estimation","Regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","magnetic flux","stators","torque control","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stator flux oriented voltage source","variable-speed drives","d-q voltage commands","torque loop","flux loop","electromagnetic torque feedback","DC voltage","DC current","inverter switching states"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/152218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Oct. 1990","displayDocTitle":"A low cost stator flux oriented voltage source variable speed drive","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4022557","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-12 Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low cost stator flux oriented voltage source variable speed drive","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00152218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041416S","chronDate":"7-12 Oct. 1990","isNumber":"3988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"497","citationCount":"67","articleId":"152218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":152248,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The DC/AC converter consists of a 50% duty ratio rectangular voltage output inverter, a high-frequency transformer, a pulse-width modulation (PWM) cycloconverter, and an LC filter. For this converter, a three-phase output DC/AC converter can be easily realized with only one inverter and one three-phase cycloconverter. Conversion efficiency is inherently high because the inverter can utilize zero-current switching to minimize the switching loss. Output waveform control is improved because the dead time in the cycloconverter PWM can be eliminated. The main circuit configuration, the PWM method of the cycloconverter used to obtain a sinusoidal output voltage and the switching method of the inverter are described.

The performance characteristics of distributive power systems using these two control techniques are presented. The comparison between the system performances with and without these distribution controls is discussed. The results of a FORTRAN program written to simulate the responses of two buck converters connected in parallel are described. It is shown that the master-slave technique provides good current distribution but no control in the output current overshoots that occur in the output of the master converter. The central-limit current distribution control is shown to provide tight control to all currents in the converters towards the central-limit reference signal that is the weighted average of the total current to the shared load. Therefore the central-limit technique is regarded as superior to the master-slave technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1990 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/497/3988/00152348.pdf","startPage":"1274","endPage":"1280 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1990 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1990.152348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1990.152348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3988","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=152348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current distribution control of converters connected in parallel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current distribution","Centralized control","Control systems","Master-slave","Power system simulation","Control system analysis","Steady-state","Error correction","Power system analysis computing","Power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis computing","digital simulation","distribution networks","electric current control","power convertors","power engineering computing","power supplies to apparatus","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","power supplies","digital simulation","current distribution control","parallel","master-slave","central-limit","performance characteristics","power systems","FORTRAN program","responses","buck converters","reference signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/152348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Oct. 1990","displayDocTitle":"Current distribution control of converters connected in parallel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4022665","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-12 Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current distribution control of converters connected in parallel","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00152348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072148S","chronDate":"7-12 Oct. 1990","isNumber":"3988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"497","citationCount":"35","articleId":"152348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":152410,"authors":[{"name":"N.V.

It is shown that the primary effect of ionizing radiation on power MOSFETs is a shift in the threshold voltage. For p-channel power MOSFETs, this shift is always negative, and for n-channel devices, the polarity of the shift depends on part type, bias conditions, and dose rate. It was found that ionizing radiation leads to failure of the amplifier if the threshold voltage of the n-channel device increases with total dose. If both power MOSFETs exhibit a negative threshold-voltage shift, increases in power dissipation and output offset voltage result. The failure mode of the amplifier depends on the relative magnitude of the threshold-voltage shift in the p- and n-channel power MOSFETs, and on the polarity of the shift in the n-channel device.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Power amplifiers","MOSFETs","Ionizing radiation","Threshold voltage","Pulse amplifiers","Bipolar transistors","Operational amplifiers","FETs","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degradation","electronic power amplifiers","ionizing radiation","complementary power MOSFETs","bias conditions","dose rate","failure","threshold voltage"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.1990.152410","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1990 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1990 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/497/3988/00152410.pdf","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1672 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1990.152410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ionizing-radiation-induced degradation in electronic power amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=152410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ionizing-radiation-induced degradation in electronic power amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/152410/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4022696","conferenceDate":"7-12 Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Oct. 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ionizing-radiation-induced degradation in electronic power amplifiers","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00152410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036119S","chronDate":"7-12 Oct. 1990","isNumber":"3988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"497","articleId":"152410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":152421,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

The transient response quantities selected as input features for training the neural network and for carrying out the assessment using the neural network are quantities which can either be calculated easily or be measured. The training process for the neural network requires very low computing time. When applied to a single-generator system, the neural network can assess the transient stability of the system accurately for a symmetrical fault on any point along the external circuit and for the range of normal prefault loading conditions. The authors also developed a back-propagation neural network for the estimation of critical fault clearing time. The authors describe the neural network configurations adopted and their use in stability assessment. Results obtained by applying the neural networks to a single-machine system are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1990.152560","startPage":"32","endPage":"36 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE TENCON'90: 1990 IEEE Region 10 Conference on Computer and Communication Systems.

The proposed algorithm can be realized efficiently and easily by dedicated hardware or gate array technology. The structure of the hardware required is so simple that it involves only memory and adders. This can achieve a high performance DCT chip at a minimum cost and development time.

Moreover, taking into account the fact that some VLCs used by H.261 and/or JPEG might be incorporated into the evolving ISO Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) algorithm, the design uses (a) PLAs for fixed VLC tables which can be shared by different algorithms and (b) content addressable memory (CAM) for downloadable tables to accommodate variations.

The previous restrictions on unit functions were relaxed such that each unit in the network represented a joint density of independent Gaussian variables with equal variances while variances across densities did not have to be the same. The algorithm was tested with samples derived from known mixtures of memoryless Gaussian sources as well as exponential and Gamma densities. Both one- and two-dimensional cases were explored. The success of the network in estimating the probability density functions depended on how well they were represented by the training samples, the number of hidden units employed and how thoroughly the network was trained. The results of comparing the network's recognition rates against those of a Bayes classifier are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/152676/","accessionNumber":"4045115","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood density estimation by means of a PDP network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood density estimation by means of a PDP network","confLoc":"Hong Kong","sourcePdf":"00152676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033624S","chronDate":"24-27 Sep 1990","isNumber":"3989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"498","citationCount":"1","articleId":"152676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":152677,"authors":[{"name":"M.-T.

The optimum receiver is used to benchmark the performance of the proposed receiver; in particular, it is proved to be instrumental in identifying the decision regions for the neural networks. The neutral networks are trained for the demodulation of signals via backpropagation-type algorithms. A modified backpropagation-type algorithm is introduced for single-user and multiuser detection with near-optimum performance that could have applications in other classification and pattern recognition problems. A comparative performance analysis of the three receivers, optimum, conventional, and the one employing neural networks, is carried out via Monte Carlo simulations. An importance sampling technique is employed to reduce the number of simulations necessary to evaluate the performance of these receivers in a multiuser environment. In examples given, the receiver significantly outperforms the conventional receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/4002/00153366.pdf","startPage":"1212","endPage":"1222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.153366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.153366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4002","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=153366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for multiuser detection in code-division multiple-access communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Multiuser detection","Demodulation","Backpropagation algorithms","Multilayer perceptrons","Spread spectrum communication","Gaussian channels","Instruments","Pattern recognition","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","demodulation","neural nets","spread spectrum communication","telecommunications computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous Gaussian channels","multiuser detection","code-division multiple-access communications","multilayer perceptrons","demodulation","spread-spectrum signals","asynchronous Gaussian channels","optimum receiver","neural networks","backpropagation-type algorithms","Monte Carlo simulations","importance sampling technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/153366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for multiuser detection in code-division multiple-access communications","volume":"40","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4272173","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for multiuser detection in code-division multiple-access communications","sourcePdf":"00153366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038275S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"4002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"185","articleId":"153366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":153367,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

The performance of frequency-hop communications with Bayesian erasure insertion is analyzed for channels with both partial-band and wideband Gaussian noise. The Bayesian technique is compared with Viterbi's ratio-threshold test, and these are compared to receivers that do not erase and use errors-only decoding. Comparisons are also made with receivers that erase all the symbols that are affected by the partial-band interference. When interference is strong, large coding gains result from the Bayesian method, and error probabilities are reduced by several orders of magnitude.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.153368","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/4002/00153368.pdf","startPage":"1231","endPage":"1238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.153368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian methods for erasure insertion in frequency-hop communication systems with partial-band interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian methods for erasure insertion in frequency-hop communication systems with partial-band interference","volume":"40","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4272175","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/153368/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian methods for erasure insertion in frequency-hop communication systems with partial-band interference","sourcePdf":"00153368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087271S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"4002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"89","articleId":"153368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":153369,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Under the cutoff priority discipline, the prioritized channel assignment procedures for a single cell and multicell system are formulated as nonlinear discrete capacity allocation problems. Exact incremental algorithms which efficiently solve the proposed problems are devised. They are based on the properties of the blocking probabilities of new calls and handoff calls. Given the number of available frequency channels together with the arrival rates and the grade of service (GOS) for both types of calls in each cell, algorithm SP1 generates an optimal channel assignment which ensures priority for handoff calls. Given the arrival rates and distinct GOSs for new and handoff calls, algorithm SP2 finds the minimum number of channels required in each cell. Algorithm MP extends algorithm SP1 to a multicell system and provides the prioritized channel assignment for all calls in the system. The algorithms are very fast and are appropriate for the fair allocation of frequency channels among cells.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.153371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/4002/00153371.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.153371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4002","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prioritized channel assignment in a cellular radio network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=153371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Prioritized channel assignment in a cellular radio network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/153371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4272178","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prioritized channel assignment in a cellular radio network","sourcePdf":"00153371.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033268S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"4002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"107","articleId":"153371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":153378,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.B.

Two possible SC integrators implementing the proposed technique are given. Both implementations allow the use of the double-sampling technique to increase by a factor of two the maximum speed of operation. The compensation operation consists in memorizing a sequence of output values of the SC integrator, and using them in the proper clock period to compensate the error due to the nonideal virtual ground. The compensation is mostly effective in a narrow frequency range centered around one specific frequency. The circuits implementing this technique are therefore particularly useful for high-Q high-frequency bandpass filters.

A control scheme for an n-generator system is first developed using a classical machine model, and then extended to a machine model that includes governor/turbine dynamics. The proposed control strategies are linear and require only local relative angle and velocity measurements for the classical model case, plus the measurement of mechanical power if governor/turbine dynamics are included. Using Lyapunov's direct method, the control is shown to be robust with respect to parameter and load variations, and topology changes in the power system. The overall power system is shown to be exponentially stable in the main so that any oscillation, anywhere in the system, can be damped efficiently. The results are obtained without any linearization of the power system model. Simulation results for the 30-bus New England system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.153642","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","startPage":"470","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.153642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4015","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/4015/00153642.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Power system dynamics","Power system modeling","Power system simulation","Power system transients","Control systems","Power system control","Power systems","Turbines","Velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov methods","oscillations","power system control","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient control","governor dynamics","robust control","sustained oscillations","power systems","machine model","turbine dynamics","Lyapunov's direct method","load variations","topology changes","exponentially stable","power system model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of robust control to sustained oscillations in power systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/153642/","volume":"39","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4228725","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of robust control to sustained oscillations in power systems","sourcePdf":"00153642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027459S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"4015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"41","articleId":"153642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":153645,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It shows that QSP2 matches the lower bound on the isoefficiency function for mesh multicomputers. The isoefficiency of QSP1 is also fairly close to optimal. Lang et al. (1985) and Schnorr et al. (1986) have developed parallel sorting algorithms for the mesh architecture that have either optimal (Schnorr) or close to optimal (Lang) run-time complexity for the one-element-per-processor case. Both QSP1 and QSP2 have worse performance than these algorithms for the one-element-per-processor case. But QSP1 and QSP2 have better scalability than the scaled-down variants of these algorithms (for the case in which there are more elements than processors). As a result, the new parallel formulations are better than these scaled-down variants in terms of speedup w.r.t the best sequential algorithms. The paper also presents a different variant of Lang's sort which is asymptotically as scalable as QSP2 (for the multiple-element-per-processor case). It briefly discusses another metric called 'resource consumption metric'. According to this metric, both QSP1 and QSP2 are strictly superior to Lang's sort and its variations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Apr-2 May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/153762/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4086953","conferenceDate":"30 April-2 May 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Scalability of parallel sorting on mesh multicomputers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalability of parallel sorting on mesh multicomputers","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00153762.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039724S","chronDate":"30 Apr-2 May 1991","isNumber":"4017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"489","citationCount":"9","articleId":"153762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":153773,"authors":[{"name":"S.N.

The 'strength' of an AC system is represented by its impedance and its mechanical (rotational) inertia. System strength expressed as an absolute numerical value, such as short circuit MVA, is useful only if compared to the power and reactive power values of its load. The short circuit ratio (SCR), defined as the ratio of system short circuit level MVA to the DC power MW, has been used to indicate system strength. A brief review of the history of short circuit ratios is given. The reasons for introducing effective, operational and critical short circuit ratios and the influence of the convertor reactive power on these ratios are considered. The effects of AC systems inertia on operation of HVDC are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/153875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sep 1991","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4039150","displayDocTitle":"AC/DC system strength as indicated by short circuit ratios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AC/DC system strength as indicated by short circuit ratios","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00153875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024923S","chronDate":"17-20 Sep 1991","isNumber":"4018","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1210","citationCount":"5","articleId":"153875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":153915,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This capability is analogous to that of the rotating synchronous condenser and it can be used in a similar way for the dynamic compensation of power transmission systems, providing voltage support, increased transient stability, and improved damping. The authors present a simplified mathematical model of the ASVC that has made it possible to derive the transfer functions needed for control system synthesis. The resulting control system designs are briefly outlined and further analysis is presented to show the behaviour of the ASVC when the line voltage is unbalanced or distorted. The analysis is based on a vectorial transformation of variables, first described by R.H. Park (1928) for AC machine analysis, and later, using complex numbers, by W.V.

The subjects produce this EEG data while performing five selected cognitive tasks. The objective of the system is to identify these tasks based on the salient features embedded in the raw EEG signals. Also, due to the demanding requirements of some environments (such as jet fighter cockpits), achieving the state recognition in near real-time is critical. Initial experiments show the system is able to correctly classify the EEG signals from the subjects 100% of the time. The classification delay is approximately 15 seconds due to the initial 10 seconds of data gathering and 5 seconds of network feedforward processing delay. It is also found that the trained network can recognize the subjects' EEG days after the initial training took place.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NEBC.1991.154576","startPage":"51","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1991 IEEE Seventeenth Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEBC.1991.154576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4024","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1991 IEEE Seventeenth Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/549/4024/00154576.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network classification of EEG using chaotic preprocessing and phase space reconstruction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/154576/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network classification of EEG using chaotic preprocessing and phase space reconstruction","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4046034","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-5 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network classification of EEG using chaotic preprocessing and phase space reconstruction","confLoc":"Hartford, CT, USA","sourcePdf":"00154576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053297S","chronDate":"4-5 Apr 1991","isNumber":"4024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"549","citationCount":"5","articleId":"154576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":155142,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It was found that for DARPA Data Set I, no single classifier is superior to the others; however, a hybrid set of classifiers yields the best performance. The neural network classifiers are based on RBFs (radial basis functions) and the MLP (multilayer perceptron) trained with backpropagation. The classical classification techniques of k-nearest neighbor and the Fisher linear discriminant are used for comparison.

In practice, the source separation algorithm also works well for nonstationary signals.

In a propulsion system such as the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME), the dynamics are complicated and sometimes not well known. However, the number of variables measured is usually much higher than the order of the system. This built-in redundancy of the sensors can be utilized to detect and correct sensor failure problems. The goal is to train a neural network to identify the sensor whose measurement is not consistent with other sensor outputs. Another neural network is trained to recover the value of critical variables when their measurements fail. Techniques for training the network with a limited amount of data are developed.

PCA is a statistical tool which can yield substantial data reduction by representing each pattern in terms of a relatively small subset of orthonormal features (principal components) extracted from the input set.

Reconstructions of the patterns from the preprocessed versions are quite impressive. Preliminary results yield nearly 90% correct classification of exemplars of 40 different Kanji characters, and also indicate that reconstruction requires more information than classification.

These networks can also be used for continuously learning systems and therefore the difficulties of training data collection are avoided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155183","startPage":"239","endPage":"244 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4026","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4026/00155183.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of neural network models for process fault detection and diagnosis problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155183/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of neural network models for process fault detection and diagnosis problems","isConference":true,"volume":"i","accessionNumber":"4169096","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of neural network models for process fault detection and diagnosis problems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041884S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"7","articleId":"155183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":155184,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

The goal is to improve the precision and accuracy of lightning prediction so that the launch commit criteria may be relaxed while maintaining acceptable safety margins. Comparisons are made with earlier methods based on correlation of wind divergence with the later occurrence of a lightning flash. Using KSC meteorological data for wind, electric field, and lightning strikes and the total area divergence product, a prediction skill level surpassing the prior state-of-the-art has been attained. Synthesis of different types of data is one of the strengths of the artificial neural systems approach. Network predictive power can be expected to increase when other inputs (e.g. temperature, humidity, satellite data, and radar returns) are included in the input array. Predictive power is also expected to improve when many days of data are used in training.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155197","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4026/00155197.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"324 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of neural networks to predict lightning at Kennedy Space Center","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Use of neural networks to predict lightning at Kennedy Space Center","isConference":true,"volume":"i","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4173842","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of neural networks to predict lightning at Kennedy Space Center","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041298S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"6","articleId":"155197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":155199,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

It is capable of solving first-order assignment problems. Each member of one set may be independently matched or blocked to a range of members of another set. One processing unit (PU) is used for each possible pairing of members, and analog association costs are applied directly to PU inputs as thresholds. Blocking constraints are enforced by circuits that oversee PU activations in each row and column, and modulate their excitations as required. Mean-field annealing is used to avoid local minima. Simulation results for problems to 64*64, with random costs, suggest that the hardware can be expected to settle in at most a few milliseconds. Since the simulation settled to the optimal solution in almost all cases it is apparent that the hardware can be expected to find at least good solutions. Characterization of an analog VLSI test chip implementing the PU and row/column constraint circuits is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4026/00155215.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"428 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=155215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural architecture for the assignment problem: simulation and VLSI implementation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Costs","Weapons","Space technology","Radar tracking","Computer architecture","Neural networks","Circuit simulation","Hardware","Circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","linear integrated circuits","neural nets","simulated annealing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blocking constraints","mean field annealing","simulation","neural network architecture","first-order assignment problems","processing unit","analog association costs","thresholds","row","column","local minima","analog VLSI test chip","row/column constraint circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"A neural architecture for the assignment problem: simulation and VLSI implementation","isConference":true,"volume":"i","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4173859","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural architecture for the assignment problem: simulation and VLSI implementation","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05085S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"2","articleId":"155215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":155219,"authors":[{"name":"C.F.

The extremely large space-bandwidth-product of the holographic materials makes it possible to construct large-scale static holographic optical neural networks (HONNs). A 1024-neuron HONN has been experimentally demonstrated for pattern recognition operations. A 32*32 optical neural network was trained to recognize different airplanes and to give the correct names at the output detector array. The computational time for training the four pairs of patterns took only a few minutes on a 386 microcomputer. It is estimated that with proper selection, over 200 pairs of heteroassociative patterns can be stored in the neural network of 1024 neurons for target recognition using the interpattern association (IPA) neural network model (T. Lu et al., 1990). By recording more holograms on a holographic plate, a 128*128 neural network and eventually a 256*256 neural network can be constructed, thus a high-speed real-time recognition of an enemy's aircraft can be performed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155235","startPage":"535","endPage":"540 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4026","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4026/00155235.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental demonstration of large-scale holographic optical neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155235/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental demonstration of large-scale holographic optical neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"i","accessionNumber":"4178262","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental demonstration of large-scale holographic optical neural network","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030053S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"1","articleId":"155235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":155237,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

The authors give the details of the procedure, called weight-elimination, describe its dynamics, and clarify the meaning of the parameters involved. From a Bayes perspective, the complexity term can be usefully interpreted as an assumption about prior distribution of the weights. The goal is to find a net that has the lowest complexity while fitting the data adequately. The complexity is dominated by the number of bits needed to encode the weights. It is roughly proportional to the number of weights times the number of bits per weight. The authors focus on the procedure of weight-elimination that tries to find a net with the smallest number of weights. They compare it with a second approach that tries to minimize the number of bits per weight, thereby creating a net that is not too dependent on the precise values of its weights. The authors use this procedure to predict currency exchange rates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155287","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4026/00155287.pdf","startPage":"837","endPage":"841 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalization by weight-elimination applied to currency exchange rate prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=155287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155287/","displayDocTitle":"Generalization by weight-elimination applied to currency exchange rate prediction","volume":"i","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4178284","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalization by weight-elimination applied to currency exchange rate prediction","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038146S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"34","articleId":"155287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":155292,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

This supervised learning system is built up from a pair of adaptive resonance theory modules that are capable of self-organizing stable recognition categories in response to arbitrary sequences of input patterns. Tested on a benchmark machine learning database in both online and offline simulations, the ARTMAP system learned orders of magnitude more quickly, efficiently, and accurately than alternative algorithms, and achieves 100% accuracy after training on less than half the input patterns in the database. It achieves these properties by using an internal controller that conjointly maximizes predictive generalization and minimizes predictive error by linking predictive success to category size on a trial-by-trial basis, using only local operations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155292","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4026/00155292.pdf","startPage":"863","endPage":"868 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARTMAP: a self-organizing neural network architecture for fast supervised learning and pattern recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"ARTMAP: a self-organizing neural network architecture for fast supervised learning and pattern recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"i","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4178288","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARTMAP: a self-organizing neural network architecture for fast supervised learning and pattern recognition","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052453S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"9","articleId":"155292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":155294,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

A training time advantage is most important when exploring new databases and preprocessing techniques to determine classification accuracies for potential applications. Since it is demonstrated that classification accuracy can be determined equally well using either PNN and BPN, it is advantageous to use PNN for this stage of a classification project. It is during this phase that most of the effort goes into training a network and a relatively small amount of effort goes into testing and evaluating the accuracy of the network. The PNN is based on the Bayes strategy for decision making and Parzen window estimation, and is asymptotically Bayes-optimal within a given feature space.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155296","startPage":"887","endPage":"892 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4026/00155296.pdf","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalization accuracy of probabilistic neural networks compared with backpropagation networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Backpropagation","Testing","Training data","Neurons","Laboratories","Artificial neural networks","Art","Decision making","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets","pattern recognition","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","learning systems","generalisation accuracy","probabilistic neural networks","backpropagation networks","training time","databases","preprocessing techniques","classification accuracies","Bayes strategy","decision making","Parzen window estimation","asymptotically Bayes-optimal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Generalization accuracy of probabilistic neural networks compared with backpropagation networks","isConference":true,"volume":"i","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","accessionNumber":"4178292","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalization accuracy of probabilistic neural networks compared with backpropagation networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038975S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"27","articleId":"155296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":155303,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

He also describes a query learning algorithm using the inverse recall for learning category boundaries in a pattern space. The method considered finds patterns near category boundaries and automatically produces a graded set of patterns between the adjacent categories. Seed patterns are selected based on the instability of the output signals of the network when the pattern is slightly perturbed. If another category's response increases, that category is selected as a target. Patterns are generated by inverting the network's mapping near the boundary. Since the inverse map is undetermined, constraints based on the domain are used to choose a particular inverse. The author first demonstrates the inverse recall method using handwritten numerals and Chinese characters. Then he demonstrates the automatic seed selection method on a two-dimensional distribution, and shows that the method cuts the number of patterns needed for boundary learning in half compared to a naive method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155304/","accessionNumber":"4178294","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning of category boundaries based on inverse recall by multilayer neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning of category boundaries based on inverse recall by multilayer neural network","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049402S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","articleId":"155304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":155311,"authors":[{"name":"B.L.

The oscillatory nature comes about by dynamic thresholds which implement a fatigue effect for the excitatory neurons.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155345","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4027/00155345.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"248 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation and binding in an oscillatory neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation and binding in an oscillatory neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4178335","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation and binding in an oscillatory neural network","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032634S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"3","articleId":"155345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":155350,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

All simulations were performed with random initial weight strengths and usually converge after approximately a hundred epochs of training. The authors discuss a quantization algorithm for dynamically extracting finite-state automata during and after training. For a well-trained neural net, the extracted automata constitute an equivalence class of state machines that are reducible to the minimal machine of the inferred grammar.

The classification performance of the k-NN classifier is exactly the same as that of the traditional k-NN classifier. However, the parallelism of the network greatly reduces the computational requirement of the traditional k-NN classifier.

Also, work in progress on a two-legged walker is briefly described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155416","startPage":"667","endPage":"673 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4027","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4027/00155416.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving neural network controllers for unstable systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155416/","displayDocTitle":"Evolving neural network controllers for unstable systems","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","accessionNumber":"4178405","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving neural network controllers for unstable systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047852S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"86","articleId":"155416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":155421,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The authors introduce a novel feedforward structure, named Nadine, that can model arbitrary Volterra series and hence arbitrary, analytic nonlinearities with memory. Nadine can be realized using layers of adaptive linear combiners in which the outputs of one layer are used as the weights rather than the activities of the next layer. This structure admits local adaptation of the linear combiners, making it possible to implement backpropagation-style learning without actually propagating adaptation information between the layers. Nadine is therefore very modular, easy to implement, and readily extendible. High-order neural networks and polynomial discriminant-based methods are the special cases of Nadine which can now be implemented modularly without involving preprocessing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155424/","accessionNumber":"4178413","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nadine-a feedforward neural network for arbitrary nonlinear time series","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nadine-a feedforward neural network for arbitrary nonlinear time series","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027379S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"4","articleId":"155424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":155426,"authors":[{"name":"K.L.

The neural network (NN) is used to learn and generate the coefficients of several predesigned discrete-time controllers as a function of external parameters. The result yields a controller whose frequency characteristics are adaptive to internal and external factors. The proposed method relies on the ability of an NN to learn and smoothly interpolate the controller coefficients. Linear optimal output feedback controllers are designed using a class of frequency-shaped quadratic performance measures and are then used to train the NN. These frequency-shaped controllers provide optimum control performance for different bands of input frequencies. The resulting NN-based adaptive optimal controllers can be utilized for extremely complex systems in which conventional nonlinear/adaptive control techniques are forbidding or of no use. The authors discuss an application of the theory and methodology to an adaptive optimal tracking system that is subjected to a wide range of external inputs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155427","startPage":"741","endPage":"746 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4027","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4027/00155427.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive neural network control with frequency-shaped optimal output feedback","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155427/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive neural network control with frequency-shaped optimal output feedback","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","accessionNumber":"4178416","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive neural network control with frequency-shaped optimal output feedback","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041346S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"1","articleId":"155427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":155428,"authors":[{"name":"L.C.

Comparisons of the neural net controllers and conventional controllers are discussed in terms of performance and efforts needed to obtain reasonable performance from both approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155431","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4027/00155431.pdf","startPage":"765","endPage":"770 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network architectures for active suspension control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Neural network architectures for active suspension control","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4178420","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network architectures for active suspension control","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036206S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"7","articleId":"155431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":155434,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Particular emphasis is given to the skill acquisition in man/machine systems where the neural network observes control behavior of a human expert and learns rules behind his expertise. The paradigm of machine acquisition of skills implies the machine exploitation of its own skills through the exploration of experience based on the transferred skills. A new neural network architecture and a learning algorithm, referred to as the hierarchically self-organizing learning (HSOL) network, is presented especially for skill learning. The HSOL network is a dynamically competitive or cooperative network with the ability of self-organizing hidden units, and functions as a universal approximator of arbitrary input-output mappings. This network is applied to machine acquisition of game playing skills, and its performance is compared with that of other networks, including backpropagation, fully connected network, bidirectional associative memory, and recurrent network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155434/","accessionNumber":"4178423","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Machine acquisition of skills by neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine acquisition of skills by neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04512S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"7","articleId":"155434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":155436,"authors":[{"name":"H.B.D.

A method for noise reduction in the cepstral domain based on a universal approximator is proposed and tested on a large database of isolated words contaminated with nonstationary F-16 jet cockpit noise. The speech recognition system consists of a concatenation of an auditory preprocessing module, the cepstral noise reduction network (CNR network), and a neural network classifier. The proposed architecture performs a nonlinear autoassociative mapping in the cepstral domain between a set of noisy cepstral coefficients from the preprocessing module and a set of noise-free cepstral coefficients. The output from the CNR network is input to the neural network classifier, in which the output functions are approximations to the Bayes optimal discriminant functions. Noise reduction is possible in the preprocessing module and in the classifier, essentially making the system a three-stage noise reduction system. The average recognition rate on a test database was improved up to 65% when the CNR network was added to the speech recognition system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155436","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4027/00155436.pdf","startPage":"795","endPage":"800 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise-robust speech recognition using a cepstral noise reduction neural network architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Noise-robust speech recognition using a cepstral noise reduction neural network architecture","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4178425","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise-robust speech recognition using a cepstral noise reduction neural network architecture","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075308S","chronDate":"8-14 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"2","articleId":"155436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":155440,"authors":[{"name":"L.Y.

For that purpose, an extension of Elman's model is presented in order to treat erroneous sequential inputs and in order to label patterns. It is suggested that the context units be updated considering their previous values and not only the values of the hidden units.

The second method does not need a pretrained network. Instead, training is performed alternatively with the entire training set and a subset thereof. This saves unnecessary backpropagation cycles for patterns that have already been learned. Depending on the data material, network training time is reduced at least by a factor of seven in the first case, and by a factor of two in the second case.

The authors propose a large-scale neural network model, CombNET-II, which consists of a four-layered network with a comb structure. A vector quantizing network forms the first layer as a stem and many three-layered networks form layers two through four as branches. As input data flows into the stem network, one of the category groups is selected according to the activation level of the neuron. Then the input data flows into one of the branch networks, which classifies the input data into a specified category. CombNET-II employs a self-growing procedure for learning the stem network and back propagation for branch networks. CombNET-II was applied to implement a network to classify 2965 printed Kanji characters (Japanese Industrial Standard, JIS first-level set). Recognition rates of 99.8 approximately 99.9% have been achieved for test data sets.

For the parity 8 problem with 16 hidden units, the new activation function f/sub 3/ uses 300 epochs for learning as compared to 500000 epochs used by the standard activation function.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155549","startPage":"946 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4027/00155549.pdf","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient activation functions for the back-propagation neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Vehicles","Laboratories","Logistics","Error correction","Convergence","Computational modeling","Humans","Psychology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["back-propagation neural network","activation functions","maximum value","parity 8 problem","epochs","learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 July 1991","displayDocTitle":"Efficient activation functions for the back-propagation neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","accessionNumber":"4178537","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient activation functions for the back-propagation neural network","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029082S","chronDate":"8-12 July 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"1","articleId":"155549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":155560,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

Self-recovery methods in artificial neural networks (ANNs) implemented on a digital VLSI chip were investigated. Fault tolerance is the potential benefit of ANNs that extends beyond the high computation rates facilitated by the massive parallelism. If a faulty neuron or a faulty link occurs in ANNs implemented on a VLSI chip, typically ANNs no longer classify all inputs correctly. The ability of ANNs to achieve fault tolerance is not inherent, but must be built in. Also, the built-in fault-tolerant mechanism must be practical and efficient enough for a VLSI chip implementation. A partial relearning scheme was proposed to achieve fault tolerance. The scheme was applied to only a single neuron level, not entire networks. Therefore, the execution speed of the partial relearning will be much faster than that of the normal learning. Furthermore, the partial relearning can be executed in a parallel fashion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155560","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4027/00155560.pdf","startPage":"951 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 July 1991","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4178549","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049325S","chronDate":"8-12 July 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"5","articleId":"155560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":155589,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

The technique differs from common 'genetic' approaches in that there is no reliance on specific mutation operations, and the representation for the solution need not be a binary string.

The Guelph Darwin Project is involved in research into the development of a system based on the principles of Darwinian evolution to improve the learning algorithms of feedforward, backpropagation (BP) neural networks. This selective-type system for artificial neural networks is achieved through the use of genetic algorithms. The project has concentrated on three stages in system development: (1) the development of a genetic code (learning algorithm rule description) which can express the learning algorithm for a neural net, (2) the analysis of the BP algorithm with respect to improvements in the training procedure, and (3) the testing of systems of competing individuals for the solution of particular problems.

The worst-case output errors produced by the failure of a hidden neuron in layered feedforward artificial neural networks were investigated. These errors can be much worse than simply the loss of the contribution of a neuron whose output goes to zero. A much larger erroneous signal can be produced when the failure sets the value of the hidden neuron to one of the power supply voltages. A method was investigated that limits the fractional error in the output signal of a feedforward net due to such saturated hidden unit faults in analog function approximation tasks. The number of hidden units is significantly increased, and the maximal contribution of each unit is limited to a small fraction of the net output signal. To achieve a large localized output signal, several Gaussian hidden units are moved into the same location in the input domain and the gain of the linear summing output unit is suitably adjusted. Since the contribution of each unit is equal in magnitude, there is only a modest error under any possible failure mode.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155612","startPage":"965 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4027","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4027/00155612.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limiting fault-induced output errors in ANNs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155612/","displayDocTitle":"Limiting fault-induced output errors in ANNs","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","accessionNumber":"4188754","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 July 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limiting fault-induced output errors in ANNs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023549S","chronDate":"8-12 July 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"3","articleId":"155612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":155615,"authors":[{"name":"N.

To evaluate predictions based on two different sets of statistics, low-order statistics versus high-order statistics. Monte-Carlo simulations were run for a simple model network, and a performance measure, i.e., relative entropy, was calculated as an average across a large number of different neuronal environments. The simulations indicate that the lower-order statistics seem to make better predictions than the higher-order statistics for most of the environments in which neurons compute predictions.

Results include general principles of how to normalize the data for concise representation, evidence that the average capacity of a CMAC network is equal to the number of 'available' memory weights, an expression for the number of available weights, and plots of the normalized generalization error as a function of the number of training samples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155631","startPage":"975 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4027/00155631.pdf","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental parameter studies for the CMAC neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent robots","Intelligent systems","Intelligent networks","Laboratories","Computer networks","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter studies","CMAC neural network","memory weights","normalized generalization error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 July 1991","displayDocTitle":"Experimental parameter studies for the CMAC neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","accessionNumber":"4188773","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental parameter studies for the CMAC neural network","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024365S","chronDate":"8-12 July 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"1","articleId":"155631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":155632,"authors":[{"name":"T.-W.

The theory of neural networks is extended to include discrete neurons called quantrons (quantum neurons, or Q'trons). Q'trons are featured in their multiple output levels whose number is usually greater than two. The dynamics of the Q'tron neural network (NN) are studied and the property of the embedded system energy, referred to as Lyapunov energy, is derived. If a problem can be reformulated as one which minimizes the Lyapunov energy, then it can be solved by a suitably constructed Q'tron NN. Two typical examples, an A/D converter and an associative adder, are realized by using such Q'tron NNs. In order to make this NN approach complete, i.e., so that it never provides false solutions, a mechanism which prevents the NN from being stuck at some local minimum of the Lyapunov energy is incorporated into each Q'tron. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NN, computer simulations have been performed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 July 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155632/","accessionNumber":"4188774","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A local-minima-free neural network approach to building A/D converters and associative adders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A local-minima-free neural network approach to building A/D converters and associative adders","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.017249S","chronDate":"8-12 July 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"3","articleId":"155632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":155636,"authors":[{"name":"T.-W.

The concept of the Hopfield neural network (NN) has been generalized where discrete neurons, called quantrons (Q'trons, a shorthand for quantum neurons), are exploited. Unlike the conventional neuron in a Hopfield NN, a Q'tron may have multiple (usually more than two) output levels. A system energy, referred to as Lyapunov energy, is embedded in the NN and is shown to possess monotonically decreasing property. Therefore, a combinatorial problem can be solved using this Q'tron NN by first reformulating the problem into one which minimizes a Lyapunov energy function, on the basis of which the NN is then built. As a result, when the NN gets to settle on a stable state, the original combinatorial problem is solved. Remarkable features of this approach are: (1) a solution to the problem, if it exists, will always be reached with probability one; and (2) no false solution will ever be reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 July 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155636/","accessionNumber":"4183490","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A complete neural network approach to solving a class of combinatorial problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A complete neural network approach to solving a class of combinatorial problems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025922S","chronDate":"8-12 July 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"4","articleId":"155636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":155648,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Simulation was done to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155683","startPage":"1004 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4027","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN-91-Seattle International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/587/4027/00155683.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for learning inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155683/","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for learning inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators","isConference":true,"volume":"ii","accessionNumber":"4183537","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 July 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for learning inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00155683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036508S","chronDate":"8-12 July 1991","isNumber":"4027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"587","citationCount":"3","articleId":"155683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":155739,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.Y.

The experimental data are taken from two separate experiments performed during 1947 and 1948. Measurements were made on overwater paths from Guadalupe Island to San Diego, CA, in one experiment, and the other was located in the South Island of New Zealand, also known as the Canterbury Project. The results are presented as one-way propagation factor in decibels versus height.

A 2.2-kV beam is used to inject a short pulse of charge into the free surface of a thin film of the polymer, and a second electron beam monitors the surface potential of the film. The surface potential is related to trapped charge density and to the depth of charge penetration. By defining a trapping parameter alpha =1/ mu tau E, one can relate the incremental buildup of surface potential to the injected charge density and carrier range. The release of electrons from traps is analyzed in terms of a time and temperature dependent demarcation energy E/sub m/. This energy is related to elapsed time since charge injection via the equation E/sub m/=kT1n(vt). Time dependence of charge decay is thus related to the energy distribution of traps in the polymer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.155782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/4031/00155782.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"686","doi":"10.1109/14.155782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The trapping of electrons in polystyrene","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"The trapping of electrons in polystyrene","volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4261686","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The trapping of electrons in polystyrene","sourcePdf":"00155782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041059S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"30","articleId":"155782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":155793,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is concluded that offset reflector antenna systems are well suited for this purpose. An HPM reflector antenna may consist of one or two reflectors that are illuminated by single or array feeds. To accurately predict the performance of an HPM reflector antenna, a versatile analysis scheme is used to compute the fields of an array feed with general configurations, and the diffraction techniques of physical optics (PO) and physical theory of diffraction (PTD) are applied to analyze reflectors of conic or shaped surfaces. Design examples of offset dual-reflector antennas for HPM applications are presented. Analysis results are shown with emphasis on both the near-field and far-field radiation characteristics. Applications of optimization (mathematical programming) techniques to the diffraction synthesis of HPM reflector antenna systems are discussed, and examples are given to demonstrate their effectiveness.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4272106","volume":"34","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Canonical examples of reflector antennas for high-power microwave applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Canonical examples of reflector antennas for high-power microwave applications","sourcePdf":"00155830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095202S","chronDate":"Aug.  1992","isNumber":"4032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"19","articleId":"155830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":155833,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The modulation of a large-diameter (12.6 cm) intense, relativistic electronic beam (500 keV, 16 kA) by an external microwave source via particle simulation is studied. The annular beam, enclosed within a coaxial drift tube, is found to be fully modulated by a low-power external RF source at a frequency of 1.3 GHz. It is shown that for such an intense beam, a highly nonlinear interaction takes place at the modulating gap, producing highly coherent bunches of electrons. This finding is similar to earlier research in which such modulations were studied for an intense beam propagating in a hollow drift tube. It is further shown that, unlike the hollow drift tube case, the coaxial configuration is easily scaled to high power. Here, a very large diameter (26 cm) intense beam (460 keV, 100 kA) is fully modulated at 1.3 GHz to obtain 31 GW of RF beam power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.155833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/4032/00155833.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"228","doi":"10.1109/15.155833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation studies of a klystronlike amplifier operating in the 10-100 GW regime","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Simulation studies of a klystronlike amplifier operating in the 10-100 GW regime","volume":"34","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4272109","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation studies of a klystronlike amplifier operating in the 10-100 GW regime","sourcePdf":"00155833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043695S","chronDate":"Aug.  1992","isNumber":"4032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"9","articleId":"155833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":155838,"authors":[{"name":"F.M.

The expanding-grid algorithm allows cell-to-cell expansion factors that can differ along the three axes. Expansion factors alpha of the order of 1.03 to 10.8 have been found to give internal fields that are in excellent agreement with those obtained analytically for 2-D homogeneous and layered lossy cylinders and for 3-D homogeneous spheres. In air outside the body, the increasing cell sizes are obviously acceptable and are still a small fraction of the free-space wavelength (< lambda /sub 0//10).

An analysis of the high-field transport properties of ultra-short gate-length AlInAs/GaInAs HEMTs shows that a reduction of gate length from 150 to 50 nm neither enhances nor reduces their average velocity. In contrast, the addition of indium from 53% to 80% improves this parameter by 19%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.155871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4033","startPage":"2007","endPage":"2014","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/4033/00155871.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"50-nm self-aligned-gate pseudomorphic AlInAs/GaInAs high electron mobility transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"50-nm self-aligned-gate pseudomorphic AlInAs/GaInAs high electron mobility transistors","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4261612","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"50-nm self-aligned-gate pseudomorphic AlInAs/GaInAs high electron mobility transistors","sourcePdf":"00155871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060785S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"355","articleId":"155871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":155876,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A 2000-AA film with an effective SiO/sub 2/ thickness of 10 AA is demonstrated. Because of the extremely high dielectric constant ( epsilon /sub r/>or approximately=>1000), even larger storage capacities can be obtained by scaling the ferroelectric film thickness, whereas the thickness of ONO films is limited by direct tunneling through the film. Electrical conduction in the PZT films studied is ohmic at electric fields below 250 kV/cm and follows an exponential field dependence at higher fields, which is shown to be consistent with a simple model for electronic hopping through the film. Leakage current as low as 9*10/sup -8/ A/cm/sup 2/ at 2.5 V for a 4000-AA film is obtained with the addition of La and Fe to compensate for Pb and O vacancies in the film. Further improvement in both leakage current and time-dependent dielectric breakdown characteristics are necessary to ensure reliable DRAM operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"2044","endPage":"2049","doi":"10.1109/16.155876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.155876","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/4033/00155876.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical characteristics of ferroelectric PZT thin films for DRAM applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Electrical characteristics of ferroelectric PZT thin films for DRAM applications","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4261617","volume":"39","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical characteristics of ferroelectric PZT thin films for DRAM applications","sourcePdf":"00155876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033349S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"210","articleId":"155876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":155882,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.M.

The gain mechanism is the same as that in the usual power tetrode in that bunched charges are delivered to the anode at the proper time and location along the anode transmission line to enhance the traveling-wave signal. If line attenuation losses are small, the power gain increases as the square of line length. Part of the backward wave can be made a forward wave by tapering the impedance of the output line.

Based on the (x/sub i/, y/sub i/) pairs, the algorithm predicts y-samples for arbitrary values of x. Noise reduction techniques based on bandwidth limiting are discussed.

Conventional terrestrial propagation models which assume a d/sup 4/ path loss law are shown to describe modern cellular and personal communication system channels, poorly. A two-ray propagation model and path loss model derived from field measurements are used to analyze the impact of path loss on the frequency reuse efficiency of DS-CDMA cellular radio systems. The analysis shows that the frequency reuse efficiency (F) of the reverse channel with a single ring of adjacent cells can vary from a maximum of 71% in d/sup 4/ channels with a favorable distribution of users, to a minimum of 33% in d/sup 2/ channels with a worst-case user distribution. For three rings of adjacent users, F drops to 58% and 16%, respectively. Using the two-ray model, it is shown that F can vary over a wide range of values due to the fine structure of propagation path loss.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.155970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4036/00155970.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.155970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4036","startPage":"231","endPage":"242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of radio propagation path loss on DS-CDMA cellular frequency reuse efficiency for the reverse channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=155970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of radio propagation path loss on DS-CDMA cellular frequency reuse efficiency for the reverse channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4272125","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of radio propagation path loss on DS-CDMA cellular frequency reuse efficiency for the reverse channel","sourcePdf":"00155970.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044882S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"95","articleId":"155970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":155972,"authors":[{"name":"S.N.

Three short-block data detection techniques based on linear, nonlinear decision-directed, and maximum likelihood estimation principles are investigated. Short alternating blocks of data and training symbols are used. The training blocks are useful for both channel tracking and data block detection. In contrast to the recursive symbol-to-symbol equalization approaches usually employed, each data block is detected as a unit.

Performance is presented for BPSK and QPSK type signaling using a Rayleigh fading channel model with severe time-dispersion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.155972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4036/00155972.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.155972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced complexity short-block data detection techniques for fading time-dispersive channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=155972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/155972/","displayDocTitle":"Reduced complexity short-block data detection techniques for fading time-dispersive channels","volume":"41","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4272127","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced complexity short-block data detection techniques for fading time-dispersive channels","sourcePdf":"00155972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03524S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","articleId":"155972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":155973,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Each voxel is a small quantum unit of volume that has numeric values associated with it representing some measurable properties or attributes of the real object or phenomenon at that voxel. It is shown that RRT operates in two phases: preprocessing voxel and discrete ray tracing. In the voxel phase, the geometric model is digitized using 3-D scan-conversion algorithms that convert the continuous representation of the model into a discrete representation within the 3-D raster. In the second phase, RRT employs a discrete variation of the conventional recursive ray tracer in which 3-D discrete rays are traversed through the 3-D raster to find the first surface voxel. Encountering a nontransparent voxel indicates a ray-surface hit. Results obtained by running the RRT software one one 20-MIPS (25-GHz) processor of a Silicon Graphics 4D/240GTX are presented in terms of CPU time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","volume":"12","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4260803","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Discrete ray tracing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete ray tracing","sourcePdf":"00156009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055919S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"88","articleId":"156009","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":156154,"authors":[{"name":"K.-C.

The algorithm, DAG-Map, carries out technology mapping and delay optimization on the entire Boolean network, instead of decomposing it into fan-out-free trees. As a preprocessing phase of DAG-Map, a general algorithm called DMIG, which transforms an arbitrary n-node network into a two-input network with only an O(1) factor increase in network depth, is introduced. A matching-based technique that minimizes area without increasing network delay, and is used in the postprocessing phase of DAG-Map is discussed. DAG-Map is compared with previous FPGA mapping algorithms on a set of logic synthesis benchmarks. The experimental results show that, on average, DAG-Map reduces both network delay and the number of look-up tables.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/54.156154","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","startPage":"7","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/54/4042/00156154.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/54.156154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DAG-Map: graph-based FPGA technology mapping for delay optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Programmable logic arrays","Fabrication","Programmable logic devices","Routing","Switches","Logic design","Design optimization","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","logic arrays","logic testing","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DAG-Map","graph-based FPGA technology mapping","delay optimization","lookup-table-based field programmable gate array","Boolean network","fan-out-free trees","DMIG","arbitrary n-node network","two-input network","matching-based technique","logic synthesis benchmarks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","displayDocTitle":"DAG-Map: graph-based FPGA technology mapping for delay optimization","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4271977","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156154/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DAG-Map: graph-based FPGA technology mapping for delay optimization","sourcePdf":"00156154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034125S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"70","articleId":"156154","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":156155,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

This process can be used to focus through inhomogeneous media on a reflective target that behaves as an acoustic source after being insonified. The time-reversal approach is introduced in a discussion of the classical techniques used for focusing pulsed waves through inhomogeneous media (adaptive time-delay techniques). Pulsed wave time-reversal focusing is shown using reciprocity valid in inhomogeneous medium to be optimal in the sense that it realizes the spatial-temporal matched filter to the inhomogeneous propagation transfer function between the array and the target. The research on time-reversed wave fields has also led to the development of new concepts that are described: time-reversal cavity that extends the concept of the TRM, and iterative time-reversal processing for automatic sorting of targets according to their reflectivity and resonating of extended targets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.156174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/4043/00156174.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.156174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time reversal of ultrasonic fields.

Il. Experimental results","abstract":"For pt.I see ibid., vol.39, no.5, p.555-66 (1992). A time-reversal mirror (TRM) is made of an array of transmit-receive transducers. The incident pressure field is sampled, digitized, stored, time-reversed and then re-emitted. This process can be used to focus, through inhomogeneous media, on a reflective target that may behave as an acoustic source after being insonified TRM experiments using a 64-channel prototype are described, and the results are given. Focusing experiments conducted on point targets through different aberrating media are described. The major result shows that the time-reversal focusing technique compensates for all the distortions whatever the TRM-aberrator distance. When the medium contains several targets, the authors show that the time-reversal process can be iterated in order to focus on the most reflective one. Lithotripsy applications are also discussed. Kidney stones are spatially extended targets and TRM experiments have been conducted on several kidney stones located behind inhomogeneous media. They show that the iterative TRM process is able to select one of the kidney stones and to focus on a small portion of it.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156175/","volume":"39","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4257246","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"18267668","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time reversal of ultrasonic fields.

A theoretical model for time-reversal cavities to optimize focusing in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media is described. The concept of the cavity can be understood as the most realistic approximation to an exact three-dimensional (3-D) time-reversal of ultrasonic fields; it is also a generalization of the time-reversal mirrors realized experimentally in the laboratory. The proposed method is based on an approach in the transient regime that is more general than the monochromatic formalism used in optics to analyze the phase conjugation mirrors efficiency. This method uses impulse diffraction theory to obtain the impulse response of the cavity in any inhomogeneous medium. An original interpretation of the limitations due to diffraction observed in wave field propagation in terms of the different waves generated inside the cavity is also proposed. The time-reversal focusing process using a closed cavity in a weakly inhomogeneous medium is compared with more classical techniques to compensate wavefront distortions, thus illustrating the focusing improvement due to the time-reversal method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156176/","volume":"39","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4257247","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"18267669","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-reversal of ultrasonic fields.

Optimal bandpass filtering is achieved by examining spectral information of the flaw and grain echoes where frequency differences have been experimentally shown to be predictable in the Rayleigh scattering region. Using optimal frequency band information, flaw echoes can then be discriminated by applying adaptive thresholding techniques based on surrounding range cells. The authors present order-statistic (OS) processors, ranked and trimmed mean (TM), to robustly estimate the threshold while censoring outliers. The design of these OS processors is accomplished analytically based on constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detection. It is shown that OS-CFAR and TM-CFAR processors can detect flaw echoes robustly with the CFAR of 10/sup -4/ where the range cell used for the threshold estimate contains outliers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/4043/00156180.pdf","startPage":"618","endPage":"630","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.156180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.156180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=156180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of order-statistic CFAR threshold estimators for improved ultrasonic flaw detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band pass filters","Rayleigh scattering","Filtering","Detectors","Robustness","Adaptive signal detection","Frequency estimation","Statistical analysis","Senior members","Microstructure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic filters","acoustic signal processing","band-pass filters","flaw detection","ultrasonic materials testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant false alarm rate detection","OS-CFAR processor","material microstructure","order-statistic CFAR threshold estimators","ultrasonic flaw detection","pulse-echo method","broadband transducers","optimal bandpass filtering","grain echoes","Rayleigh scattering region","optimal frequency band","adaptive thresholding techniques","OS processors","TM-CFAR processors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of order-statistic CFAR threshold estimators for improved ultrasonic flaw detection","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4257251","pubMedId":"18267673","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of order-statistic CFAR threshold estimators for improved ultrasonic flaw detection","sourcePdf":"00156180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02704S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"26","articleId":"156180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":156379,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) offer high speed and good device matching characteristics that are attractive for many high-speed circuits, but they are more susceptible than other IC technologies to the unexpected generation of very high junction temperatures. The reasons for this tendency are discussed, and an HBT sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit that had device temperature rises of over 300 degrees C is described. To address this problem, a new thermal simulation tool called ThCalc was created. ThCalc calculates the temperature profile of an IC and runs fast enough to allow calculations on a whole chip. ThCalc was used to redesign the S/H IC to reduce the largest temperature rise by a factor of 2.7 with a minimal impact on circuit size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156441/","volume":"27","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"4288006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Thermal design and simulation of bipolar integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal design and simulation of bipolar integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00156441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041393S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"44","articleId":"156441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":156446,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The weakest link is its handling of characters which are difficult to segment. The engine is divided into four phases: segmentation, image recognition, ambiguity resolution, and document analysis. The features are zonal and reduce the image to a blurred, gray-level representation. The classifier is data-driven, trained offline, and model-free. Handcrafted features and decision trees tend to be brittle in the presence of noise. To satisfy the needs of full-text applications, the system captures the structure of the document so that, when viewed in a word processor or spreadsheet program, the formatting of the optically recognized document reflects that of the original document. To satisfy the needs of the forms market, a proofing and correction tool displays 'pop-up' images of uncertain characters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Omnidocument technologies","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.156470","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/4050/00156470.pdf","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.156470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4050","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=156470","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156470/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1992","displayDocTitle":"Omnidocument technologies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"80","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4258676","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Omnidocument technologies","sourcePdf":"00156470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050932S","chronDate":"July  1992","isNumber":"4050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"81","articleId":"156470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":156474,"authors":[{"name":"S.N.

The usefulness of 'regular' versus 'singular' classes of features is stressed. These notions are applied to obtain a graph, G, representing a line image, and also to find an 'axis' as the regular part of G. The complements to G of the axis are the 'tarsi', singular parts of G, which correspond to informative features of a cursive word. A segmentation of the graph is obtained, giving a symbolic description chain (SDC). Using one or more as robust anchors, possible words in a list of words are selected. Candidate words are examined to see if the other letters fit the rest of the SDC.

The design of a 16*16 2's complement parallel multiplier using Overturned-Stairs trees is studied as an illustration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/4052/00156536.pdf","startPage":"940","endPage":"948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"'Overturned-stairs' adder trees and multiplier design","doi":"10.1109/12.156536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.156536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=156536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"'Overturned-stairs' adder trees and multiplier design","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4266759","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"'Overturned-stairs' adder trees and multiplier design","sourcePdf":"00156536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034476S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"27","articleId":"156536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":156537,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It is efficient for modular exponentiation with a large modulus, used in public-key cryptosystems such as the RSA cryptosystem. The operands and the result of multiplication which are intermediate results in modular exponentiation are represented in a redundant representation. The computation proceeds in serial-parallel fashion. Each subtraction for the division for residue calculation is embedded in the repeated multiply-add. Each intermediate result is represented in a more redundant representation than that for the operands and the result, so that the number of the required addition/subtractions is reduced. All addition/subtraction are carried out without carry propagation. A serial-parallel modular multiplier based on the algorithm has a regular cellular array structure with a bit slice feature and is suitable for VLSI implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/4052/00156537.pdf","startPage":"949","endPage":"956","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.156537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.156537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=156537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A radix-4 modular multiplication hardware algorithm for modular exponentiation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Public key cryptography","Very large scale integration","Digital arithmetic","Iterative algorithms","Throughput","Computer security","Algorithm design and analysis","Circuits","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","digital arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["division subtraction","radix-4 modular multiplication hardware algorithm","modular exponentiation","public-key cryptosystems","RSA cryptosystem","redundant representation","residue calculation","repeated multiply-add","serial-parallel modular multiplier","cellular array structure","bit slice","VLSI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"A radix-4 modular multiplication hardware algorithm for modular exponentiation","volume":"41","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4266760","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A radix-4 modular multiplication hardware algorithm for modular exponentiation","sourcePdf":"00156537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030305S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"51","articleId":"156537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":156538,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Consideration is given to avoid global data communications and dependency of the time step duration on m. This is important for applications where the value of m is large. The divider requires only three basic processors and one simple control signal and its circuit and time complexities are proportional to m/sup 2/ and m, respectively. It does not depend on the irreducible polynomial and can be expanded easily. Moreover, with m additional simple processors, a bit-serial systolic multiplier is developed which uses part of the divider structure.

The algorithm iterates by using the reciprocal to find an approximate quotient and then subtracting the quotient multiplied by the divisor from the dividend to find a remaining dividend. Fast implementations can produce an average of either 14 or 27 b per iteration, depending on whether the basic or advanced version of this method is implemented. Detailed analyses are presented to support the claimed accuracy per iteration. Speed estimates using state-of-the-art ECL components show that this method is faster than the Newton-Raphson technique and can produce 53-b quotients of 53-b numbers in about 25 ns using the basic method and 21 ns using the advanced method. In addition, these methods naturally produce an exact remainder, which is very useful for implementing precise rounding specifications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.156541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.156541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/4052/00156541.pdf","startPage":"981","endPage":"995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast division using accurate quotient approximations to reduce the number of iterations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Fast division using accurate quotient approximations to reduce the number of iterations","volume":"41","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4266764","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast division using accurate quotient approximations to reduce the number of iterations","sourcePdf":"00156541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034771S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"44","articleId":"156541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":156542,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The performance of CFR-CORDIC is estimated and compared with that of previously proposed schemes. It is found to provide an execution time similar to that of redundant CORDIC with a variable scaling factor, with a significant saving in area.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.156544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/4052/00156544.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.156544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant-factor redundant CORDIC for angle calculation and rotation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Constant-factor redundant CORDIC for angle calculation and rotation","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4266767","volume":"41","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant-factor redundant CORDIC for angle calculation and rotation","sourcePdf":"00156544.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052084S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"76","articleId":"156544","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":156545,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The emphasis is on a 32-b word size comparable to IEEE 754 single precision, although other word sizes are possible. A multilayer sign/logarithm format is considered. The lowest layer, similar to previous implementations, would provide only normalized representations but would not provide representations for zero, denormalized values, infinities, and NaNs. The highest layer would provide most of the features found in IEEE 754, including zeros, denormalized values, infinities, and NaNs. Novel algorithms for implementing logarithmic denormalized arithmetic are presented. Simulation results show that the error characteristics of the proposed logarithmic denormalized arithmetic algorithms are similar to those of the denormalized floating point arithmetic in IEEE 754.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/4052/00156547.pdf","startPage":"1040","endPage":"1050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.156547","doi":"10.1109/12.156547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying features of IEEE 754 to sign/logarithm arithmetic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Applying features of IEEE 754 to sign/logarithm arithmetic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156547/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4266770","volume":"41","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying features of IEEE 754 to sign/logarithm arithmetic","sourcePdf":"00156547.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041445S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"30","articleId":"156547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":156574,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

The framework, called ecological interface design (EID), is based on the skills, rules, and knowledge taxonomy of cognitive control. The basic goals of EID are not to force processing to a higher level than the demands of the task require, and to support each of the three levels of cognitive control. Thus, an EID interface should not contribute to the difficulty of the task, and at the same time, it should support the entire range of activities that operators will be faced with. Three prescriptive design principles are suggested to achieve this objective, each directed at supporting a particular level of cognitive control. Particular attention is paid to presenting a coherent deductive argument justifying the principles of EID. Support for the EID framework is discussed.

The vector potential is a spatial convolution of the free space Green's function and the contrast source over the domain of interest. A weak form of the integral equation for the relevant unknown quantity is obtained by testing it with appropriate testing functions. The vector potential is then expanded in a sequence of the appropriate expansion functions and the grad-div operator is integrated analytically over the scattering object domain only. A weak form of the singular Green's function has been used by introducing its spherical mean. As a result, the spatial convolution can be carried out numerically using a trapezoidal integration rule.

The mixer uses a twin-slot antenna which has the advantages of a good beam pattern and a low impedance. The radiation and impedance characteristics of the antenna were obtained from a moment-matched calculation. Tapered superconducting microstrip transmission lines are used to carry the radiation from the slot antennas to the tunnel junction. The effective impedance seen by the tunnel junction is quite low, about 4 Omega , which allows micron-size junctions to be used at 500 GHz. The mixers have been fabricated using Nb/Al-oxide/Nb tunnel junctions and a receiver noise temperature of 420 K (DSB) was measured at 490 GHz, which is the best yet obtained for a quasi-optical mixer at this frequency. The comparatively large junction area increases the mixer saturation power and allows strong suppression of noise from the Josephson effect by the application of a magnetic field of modest strength.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-optical slot antenna SIS mixers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.156607","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/4055/00156607.pdf","startPage":"1797","endPage":"1804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.156607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=156607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156607/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-optical slot antenna SIS mixers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4283535","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-optical slot antenna SIS mixers","sourcePdf":"00156607.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060388S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"131","articleId":"156607","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":156608,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

Upper bounds are derived on the number of N-bit codewords for the single- and double-loop modulators. Analytical lower bounds on the mean squared error (MSE) obtainable by any decoder, linear or nonlinear, in approximating the constant input are also derived. Optimal nonlinear decoders for constant inputs based on a table lookup approach which operates directly on the nonuniform quantization intervals are considered. Using simulations is is found that the optimal nonlinear decoders perform better than linear decoders, by about 3 and 20 dB for the single- and double-loop modulators, respectively. A cascade structure specifically for constant inputs is introduced, and its corresponding decoding algorithm is derived. It is shown that for a fixed latency, the MSE performance of the cascade structure is 12 dB superior, and its throughput is twice that of the conventional two-stage MASH modulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/4056/00156642.pdf","startPage":"1375","endPage":"1387","doi":"10.1109/26.156642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.156642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New properties of sigma-delta modulators with DC inputs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156642/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"New properties of sigma-delta modulators with DC inputs","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4272192","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New properties of sigma-delta modulators with DC inputs","sourcePdf":"00156642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041178S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"37","articleId":"156642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":156644,"authors":[{"name":"G. de Veciana","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"G.","lastName":"de Veciana","id":"37269862400"},{"name":"A.

Stability is determined by comparing the initial and final values of the error for one cycle and using the ratio of these values as the loop gain in a discrete time model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit stability","Detectors","Space vector pulse width modulation","Control systems","Diodes","Gain control","Radio frequency","Pulse modulation","Research and development","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic gain control","detector circuits","stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability limits","AGC circuits","peak detectors","second-order automatic gain control","narrow-pulsewidth signals","diode-type detector","system response","loop condition","initial condition","error","loop gain","discrete time model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/30.156710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/4057/00156710.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.156710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of AGC circuits containing peak detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=156710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability of AGC circuits containing peak detectors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156710/","volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4299502","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of AGC circuits containing peak detectors","sourcePdf":"00156710.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033459S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"8","articleId":"156710","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":156719,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Hee Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Hee Kang","id":"37981707000"},{"name":"Jin Ho Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin Ho Choi","id":"37384381600"},{"name":"Yong Hoon Lee","affiliation":["Consumer Electronics Research Laboratory, Gold Star Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong Hoon Lee","id":"38258250000"},{"name":"Choon Lee","affiliation":["Consumer Electronics Research Laboratory, Gold Star Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Choon Lee","id":"37985746100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"156719","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image reconstruction","Robustness","Isolation technology","Consumer electronics","Signal analysis","Statistical analysis","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","image coding","pulse-code modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["median predictors","image coding","differential pulse code modulation","PM-DPCM","transmission errors","performance","DPCM systems","statistical properties"]}],"abstract":"A differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) system employing a median predictor, which is called the predictive-median-DPCM (PM-DPCM), is proposed.

This processor requires a minimum number of arithmetic components and satisfies the CCITT standards using a minimum possible number of bits for cosine coefficients and internal word length compared to other architectures. The architecture is so flexible that it can be used for inverse DCT processing just by changing the control signals. The architecture works in real time at a 32-MHz rate.

It is shown that a simple network program can be implemented by differential weighting of the input data vector. In favorable cases the programming vector can be estimated by seeing relatively few examples of the output, if the task and the structure of the data allow it. Therefore, easy programming is allowed in only a limited domain, controlled by the data representation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/35.156800","pdfPath":"/iel4/35/4060/00156800.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.156800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-network learning and Mark Twain's cat","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network learning and Mark Twain's cat","volume":"30","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4283627","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network learning and Mark Twain's cat","sourcePdf":"00156800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050791S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"4","articleId":"156800","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":156802,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

A pulsed Fabry-Perot amplifier (FPA) is most sensitive to input lightwave at the instant the carrier density is crossing the critical region, and gives a sharply pulsed sampling effect on the input lightwave signal. Compared with a FPA operating at subcritical electron density, the pulsed amplifier gives much higher gain, peak power, and bandwidth. In fact, pulsed operation of a FPA is also expected to give significantly higher gain and about the same peak output power as a traveling wave amplifier. Pulsed operation also improves the performance of a traveling wave amplifier by attenuating its internally reflected waves.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.156842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.156842","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1040","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/4062/00156842.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A theoretical study of pulsed laser sampling photon amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"A theoretical study of pulsed laser sampling photon amplifiers","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"10","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4271801","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156842/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theoretical study of pulsed laser sampling photon amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00156842.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04056S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","articleId":"156842","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":156845,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It accounts for the carrier and field distributions in the longitudinal direction as well as for the facet reflectivities. The model can handle arbitrary time-varying input signals and current modulations. The model is used to assess intermodulation distortion and crosstalk. Cascaded amplifiers are considered, and the crosstalk and intermodulation distortion due to cascaded amplifiers are found to accumulate by adding together in amplitude; this may limit the number or cascaded amplifiers in multichannel systems. Carrier-induced nonlinearities depend strongly on facet reflectivities; for 25 dB of single-pass gain, a reflectivity of 5*10/sup -4/ will result in 3 dB excess distortion. Reduction of intermodulation distortion by use of multisection amplifiers is found to be possible only for small channel separations (<300 MHz). Simulations of 11-channel amplification showed a reduction of 13 dB in intermodulation distortion when random-phase optical carriers are applied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4271804","volume":"10","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detailed dynamic model for semiconductor optical amplifiers and their crosstalk and intermodulation distortion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detailed dynamic model for semiconductor optical amplifiers and their crosstalk and intermodulation distortion","sourcePdf":"00156845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042591S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"102","articleId":"156845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":156847,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Calculations are made of the noise, eye diagrams, and bit-error-rate characteristics of lightwave systems with optical amplifiers. Indications are given of the effect of amplifier characteristics such as spontaneous noise and signal distortion due to gain saturation on the system performance. The nonlinear process within semiconductor laser amplifiers leads generally to pulse amplitude-temporal distortions due to gain saturation. This theoretical study demonstrates that the system penalty caused by these nonlinear effects appears progressively as the optical input power at each amplifier is increased. For example, nonregenerated fiber transmission using traveling wave semiconductor laser amplifiers was simulated, and results obtained at 0.5 and 2.5 Gb/s are presented.

Both erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) and semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are applicable. Analytical results are presented for both amplified and unamplified fiber-optic recirculating delay lines (AFORDLs and UFORDLs). In the AFORDL an OA is inserted in the fiber loop. It is shown that the active AFORDL structure is capable of realizing all-fiber filters not possible with the passive UFORDL. This result is significant because it shows that the OAs can function beyond just the trivial optical loss compensation to provide extra flexibility not available in passive designs. An AFORDL design is presented which has a pole near +1 and a zero at -1 in the Z-plane resulting in useful characteristics in the magnitude and phase responses. The results suggest that extension of the concept to higher-order filters has the potential to lead to the realization of more complex optical processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay lines","Optical filters","Optical signal processing","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Stimulated emission","Optical fiber amplifiers","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Optical fiber filters","Passive filters","Optical losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay lines","fibre lasers","fibre optics","optical information processing","semiconductor junction lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Er/sup 3+/-doped fibre amplifiers","UFORDL structure","optical amplifiers","fiber-optic delay line signal processing","semiconductor optical amplifiers","fiber-optic recirculating delay lines","AFORDL structure","all-fiber filters","optical loss compensation","magnitude","phase responses","optical processors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.156857","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/4062/00156857.pdf","startPage":"1142","endPage":"1147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.156857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel amplified fiber-optic recirculating delay line processor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=156857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel amplified fiber-optic recirculating delay line processor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156857/","volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4271816","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel amplified fiber-optic recirculating delay line processor","sourcePdf":"00156857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041948S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"56","articleId":"156857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":156858,"authors":[{"name":"C.-S.

This effect is significant for high-bit-rate channels in a dense wavelength-division-multiplexed system in a LAN/MAN environment which requires narrow-band filters to suppress crosstalk from adjacent channels. A simulation approach is used to determine the channel capacity in the presence of chirp and crosstalk. The results show that a minimal channel spacing of less than 37 and 10 GHz with each channel operating at 2 Gb/s using OOK and FSK, respectively, can be achieved by a dense wavelength division multiple access system.

This means that the peak power of short pump pulses cannot be reduced to less than the critical value at N>5 to prevent the effect of GVD. This restriction is more severe for pump pulses in the anomalous dispersion region than for those in the normal dispersion region because of higher-order soliton compression. System designs for time-division demultiplexers that use NSISs and picosecond pump pulses generated by a laser-diode coupled to erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are discussed. It is found that 1:32 demultiplexing from 160 to 5 Gb/s and 1:8 demultiplexing from 80 to 10 Gb/s with a switching contrast of more than 60 are possible using diode-laser-pumped 1- and 2-ps pump pulses, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.156860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.156860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4062","startPage":"1167","endPage":"1178","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/4062/00156860.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=156860","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","Phase modulation","Pulse amplifiers","Switches","Solitons","Optical pulse generation","Demultiplexing","Numerical analysis","Sagnac interferometers","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light interferometers","nonlinear optics","optical dispersion","optical modulation","optical pumping","optical switches","solitons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Er/sup 3+/-doped fibre amplifiers","diode laser pumping","group velocity dispersion","nonlinear Sagnac interferometer switch","self phase modulation","cross phase modulation","pump-probe walk-off","switching performance","soliton number","GVD","anomalous dispersion region","normal dispersion region","time-division demultiplexers","switching contrast","5 to 160 Gbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effects of group velocity dispersion on self/cross phase modulation in a nonlinear Sagnac interferometer switch","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4271819","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156860/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of group velocity dispersion on self/cross phase modulation in a nonlinear Sagnac interferometer switch","sourcePdf":"00156860.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032691S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"32","articleId":"156860","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":156876,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

The stitching errors are associated with small-area, high-resolution electron beam exposure, which has the potential advantage of high-speed writing of laser gratings. Measurements show that the errors are composed of a systematic and a stochastic part. Their effect on the gain margin was simulated both for lambda /4 phase-shifted and optimized multiple-phase-shifted DFB lasers. Simulations show that the lasers are insensitive to the systematic part of the stitching errors if the number of errors is large enough. The stochastic part was found to give rise to a variation in gain margin of the DFB lasers. It is concluded that the field stitching accuracy in the high-resolution mode of a commercial system for electron beam lithography is sufficient to provide a high yield of single-mode lasers. However, it is essential that certain precautions be taken considering exposure conditions and that a fault tolerant laser design be used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.156877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.156877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063","startPage":"1256","endPage":"1266","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/4063/00156877.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=156877","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed feedback devices","Laser modes","Electron beams","Laser feedback","Lithography","Writing","Gratings","Stochastic systems","Stochastic processes","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffraction gratings","distributed feedback lasers","electron beam lithography","errors","gallium arsenide","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","optical workshop techniques","semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase shifted lasers","systematic errors","stochastic errors","simulation","Bragg grating","stitching errors","spectral characteristics","DFB lasers","electron beam lithography","single-mode characteristics","high-resolution electron beam exposure","high-speed writing","laser gratings","gain margin","fault tolerant laser design","InP-InGaAsP laser"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The effect of stitching errors on the spectral characteristics of DFB lasers fabricated using electron beam lithography","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4294068","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156877/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of stitching errors on the spectral characteristics of DFB lasers fabricated using electron beam lithography","sourcePdf":"00156877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033441S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"25","articleId":"156877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":156880,"authors":[{"name":"I.M.I.

However, with the required low level of amplifier output power which is imposed by nonlinearity in the transmission fiber, the resulting pump power becomes too low to effectively invert the gain medium of the amplifiers. Consequently, the amplifier output noise level becomes too high for proper system operation. This problem is solved by pumping the amplifiers harder so that a higher gain and higher output power are achieved. The excess gain is then counteracted by an appropriate value of post-amplifier loss. Because of the higher pump power in this case, the amplifier noise is reduced significantly. This technique is investigated theoretically, and experimental work that verifies it is reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Power amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Optical fiber amplifiers","Power generation","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","High power amplifiers","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Noise figure","Optical noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","fibre lasers","noise","optical communication equipment","optical solitons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Er-doped fibre amplifiers","noise reduction","soliton system","NRZ system","long-haul lightwave all-amplifier systems","gain","output power","pump power","output noise level","post-amplifier loss"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.156880","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/4063/00156880.pdf","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.156880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise reduction in long-haul lightwave all-amplifier systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=156880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Noise reduction in long-haul lightwave all-amplifier systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156880/","volume":"10","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4294071","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise reduction in long-haul lightwave all-amplifier systems","sourcePdf":"00156880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031338S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"11","articleId":"156880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":156881,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In a 100-Mb/s transmission system a receiver sensitivity of -51.6 dBm has been measured. The loss in relation to the shot noise limit of -66.3 dBm (18 photons/b) is mostly due to the low local laser power and the influence of the receiver input noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.156881","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1296","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/4063/00156881.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.156881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent optical QPSK intradyne system: concept and digital receiver realization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Optical receivers","Optical signal processing","Demodulation","Optical sensors","Phase locked loops","Phase shift keying","Bandwidth","Phase noise","Laser noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulators","digital communication systems","optical modulation","optical receivers","phase shift keying","phase-locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent optical QPSK intradyne system","digital receiver","optical quadrature phase-shift keying","QPSK","synchronous demodulation","phase synchronization","signal processing bandwidth","phase diversity receiver","intradyne receiver","orthogonal electrical demodulation","shot noise limit","digital phase-locked loop","receiver sensitivity","100 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Coherent optical QPSK intradyne system: concept and digital receiver realization","volume":"10","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4294072","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156881/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent optical QPSK intradyne system: concept and digital receiver realization","sourcePdf":"00156881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05088S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"66","articleId":"156881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":156884,"authors":[{"name":"T.-H.

The ring uses a SONET ring to carry working traffic and a passive ring to carry protection traffic in case of network component failures. The passive ring, which is composed of optical switches and optical amplifiers, is essentially an optical add-drop protection ring. The optical signal add-drop is controlled by SONET add-drop multiplexers using existing SONET self-healing protocols. A SONET control scheme for this implementation is also discussed.

By using such a combination of relays it is possible to develop comprehensive protection against frequency disturbances, both sudden and gradual. It is emphasized that in a system where the causes of frequency disturbances are quite varied and complex, a fully automatic scheme may not be the ideal solution and manual load shedding as a backup may be necessary. A typical procedure for a captive power plant system operating in parallel with the grid is described as applicable to a continuous process plant industry. The strategy for islanding such industrial power systems from the grid during grid disturbances is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Relays","Character generation","Electricity supply industry","Power generation","Power system relaying","Protection","Protective relaying","Power markets","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load shedding","power system protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["utility applications","frequency disturbance protection","industrial power system islanding","discrete underfrequency relaying","India","captive power applications","coordinated load shedding","frequency trend relays","grid disturbances"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.156990","startPage":"1878","endPage":"1884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/4066/00156990.pdf","doi":"10.1109/61.156990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency trend and discrete underfrequency relaying practices in India for utility and captive power applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Frequency trend and discrete underfrequency relaying practices in India for utility and captive power applications","accessionNumber":"4307166","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","volume":"7","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/156990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency trend and discrete underfrequency relaying practices in India for utility and captive power applications","sourcePdf":"00156990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026036S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"15","articleId":"156990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":156991,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

The authors present a general analysis of optical switching fabrics using SOAs, considering noise and saturation effects associated with amplified spontaneous emission. They find that the SOA saturation output power limits the number of switches which can be cascaded. For example, a saturation output power of 100 mW limits the size of switching fabrics to 100 64*64 switches or 200 8*8 switches if distributed gain matrix-vector multiplier (MVM) switches or Benes switches are employed. The corresponding limit for lumped gain MVM fabrics is 10 64*64 or 100 8*8. The Benes switch may be more suitable for large switch size (N>16) because it requires fewer SOAs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/4072/00157145.pdf","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.157145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.157145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=157145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space division switches based on semiconductor optical amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical switches","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Power semiconductor switches","Fabrics","Optical noise","Power generation","Stimulated emission","Optical saturation","Semiconductor device noise","Spontaneous emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated optics","optical saturation","optical switches","semiconductor device noise","semiconductor lasers","semiconductor switches","superradiance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple space division switches","cascaded switches","distributed gain matrix vector multiplier switch","64 by 64 switch","8 by 8 switch","semiconductor optical amplifiers","optical switching fabrics","noise","saturation effects","amplified spontaneous emission","output power","64*64 switches","8*8 switches","Benes switches","lumped gain MVM fabrics","100 mW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/157145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Space division switches based on semiconductor optical amplifiers","volume":"4","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4289478","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space division switches based on semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00157145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028413S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"59","articleId":"157145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":157147,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

This scheme not only considerably reduces the searching and matching time but also provides a meaningful characterization of the intrinsic motion structure. The variable-block-size approach also avoids the drawback of the constant-size MRMC in describing small object motion activities. After wavelet decomposition, each scaled subframe tends to have different statistical properties. An adaptive truncation process is implemented, and a bit allocation scheme similar to that in transform coding is examined. Four variations of the proposed motion-compensated wavelet video compression system are identified, and it is shown that the coding approach has a superior performance in terms of the peak-to-peak signal-to-noise ratio as well as the subjective quality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/4073/00157160.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.157160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.157160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=157160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion-compensated wavelet transform coding for color video compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Video compression","Signal resolution","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image resolution","Frequency","Image coding","Motion compensation","Humans","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colour television","data compression","encoding","picture processing","transforms","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","variable block size","peak to peak SNR","wavelet transform coding","color video compression","multiresolution motion compensation","wavelet pyramid","wavelet decomposition","statistical properties","adaptive truncation","bit allocation","signal-to-noise ratio","subjective quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/157160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Motion-compensated wavelet transform coding for color video compression","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4273627","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion-compensated wavelet transform coding for color video compression","sourcePdf":"00157160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072684S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"171","articleId":"157160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":157176,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The idea of including a priori knowledge of propagation conditions in ranging procedures for the purpose of improving the range estimate has received considerable attention in recent years. The interest is based on an observation that a large propagation delay measured between two coherent arrivals at a single receiver is equivalent geometrically to a delay generated by a single arrival in propagating to two widely spaced receivers. If the equivalent sensor spacing is on the order of or larger than the dimensions of an actual array, multipath ranging appears to be an attractive alternative to conventional curvature measurement approaches. This paper considers the potential performance improvements attainable in the process of exploiting a second path in long range ranging. The performance of line arrays is pursued in detail for a problem setting in which all of the parameters describing the signal and channel parameters are known a priori.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.157176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4074/00157176.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.157176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive ranging in multipath dominant environments.

Such a strategy leaves the algorithm extremely vulnerable to impulsive interference. A class of adaptive algorithms employing order statistic filtering of the sampled gradient estimates is presented. These algorithms, dubbed order statistic least mean squares (OSLMS), are designed to facilitate adaptive filter performance close to the least squares optimum across a wide range of input environments from Gaussian to highly impulsive. Three specific OSLMS filters are defined: the median LMS, the average LMS, and the trimmed-mean LMS. The properties of these algorithms are investigated and the potential for improvement demonstrated. Finally, a general adaptive OSLMS scheme in which the nature of the order-statistic operator is also adapted in response to the statistics of the input signal is presented. It is shown that this can facilitate performance gains over a wide range of input data types.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.157180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4074/00157180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.157180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074","startPage":"44","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A class of order statistic LMS algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=157180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A class of order statistic LMS algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/157180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4125972","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A class of order statistic LMS algorithms","sourcePdf":"00157180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045438S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"4074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"69","articleId":"157180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":157181,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

The computational requirement due to the encoding search process, had hindered application of VQ to real-time high-quality coding of color TV images. Reduction of the encoding search complexity through partitioning of a large codebook into the on-chip memories of a concurrent VLSI chip set is proposed. A real-time vector quantizer architecture for encoding color images is developed. The architecture maps the mean/quantized residual vector quantizer (MQRVQ) (an extension of mean/residual VQ) onto a VLSI/LSI chip set. The MQRVQ contributes to the feasibility of the VLSI architecture through the use of a simple multiplication free distortion measure and reduction of the required memory per code vector. Running at a clock rate of 25 MHz the proposed hardware implementation of this architecture is capable of real-time processing of 480*768 pixels per frame with a refreshing rate of 30 frames/s. The result is a real-time high-quality composite color image coder operating at a fixed rate of 1.12 b per pixel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI architecture for real-time image coding using a vector quantization based algorithm","doi":"10.1109/78.157193","startPage":"181","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.157193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4074/00157193.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=157193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/157193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI architecture for real-time image coding using a vector quantization based algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4125984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI architecture for real-time image coding using a vector quantization based algorithm","sourcePdf":"00157193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031607S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"4074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","articleId":"157193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":157194,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

The number of iterations required by the new algorithm to converge is less than 20% of what is required by the backpropagation algorithm. Also, it is less affected by the choice of initial weights and setup parameters. The algorithm uses a modified form of the backpropagation algorithm to minimize the mean-squared error between the desired and actual outputs with respect to the inputs to the nonlinearities. This is in contrast to the standard algorithm which minimizes the mean-squared error with respect to the weights. Error signals, generated by the modified backpropagation algorithm, are used to estimate the inputs to the nonlinearities, which along with the input vectors to the respective nodes, are used to produce an updated set of weights through a system of linear equations at each node. These systems of linear equations are solved using a Kalman filter at each layer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.157194","startPage":"202","endPage":"210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.157194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4074/00157194.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast new algorithm for training feedforward neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/157194/","displayDocTitle":"A fast new algorithm for training feedforward neural networks","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4125986","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast new algorithm for training feedforward neural networks","sourcePdf":"00157194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024313S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"4074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"164","articleId":"157194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":157195,"authors":[{"name":"V.

A first-order equalization mechanism, specifically aiming at avoiding the norm shrinkage problem, is incorporated in a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to model the speech cepstral sequence. Such a modeling technique requires special care, as the formulation inevitably involves parameter estimation from a set of data with singular dispersion. Solutions to this HMM stochastic modeling problem are provided, and algorithms for estimating the necessary model parameters are given. It is experimentally shown that incorporation of the first-order mean equalization model makes the HMM-based speech recognizer robust to noise. With respect to a conventional HMM recognizer, this leads to an improvement in recognition performance which is equivalent to a gain of about 15-20 dB in signal-to-noise ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/157214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4268010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"9","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov models with first-order equalization for noisy speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov models with first-order equalization for noisy speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00157214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035244S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","articleId":"157214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":157217,"authors":[{"name":"N.I.

Given a low-pass filter, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a complementary high-pass filter that will permit perfect reconstruction are derived. The perfect reconstruction condition is posed as a Bezout identity, and it is shown how it is possible to find all higher-degree complementary filters based on an analogy with the theory of Diophantine equations.

This method exploits the additive property of the Fourier transform (FT) phase to extract spectral information of the signal in the presence of noise. The phase is generally featureless due to random polarity and wrappings, but the group delay function can be processed to derive significant information such as peaks in the spectral envelope. In the resulting spectral estimates obtained the resolution properties of the periodogram estimate are preserved while the variance is reduced. Variance caused by the sidelobe leakage due to windows and additive noise are significantly reduced even in the spectral estimate obtained using a single realization of the observation peak. Resolution is primarily dictated by the size of the data window. The method works even for high noise levels. The results of this procedure are demonstrated through two illustrative examples: estimation of sinusoids in noise and estimation of the narrowband autoregressive process in noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.157227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4075/00157227.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.157227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4075","startPage":"2281","endPage":"2289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Significance of group delay functions in spectrum estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=157227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Significance of group delay functions in spectrum estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/157227/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4268023","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Significance of group delay functions in spectrum estimation","sourcePdf":"00157227.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102523S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"88","articleId":"157227","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":157230,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

Solutions for the case of a uniform linear array and arbitrary number of sources are found provided that the number of sensors is large. For this case, it is found that the MSE of ESPRIT with maximum aperture (i.e., maximum-overlapping subarrays) is lower than that of ESPRIT with nonoverlapping subarrays. A comparison with MUSIC suggests that the MSE for MUSIC is lower than that for ESPRIT.

A theory based on the channel convolution matrix nullspace is proposed to explain the failure of Godard algorithms for such practical blind equalization situations.

It is observed that these algorithms are both special cases of a single filter bank structure, the discrete wavelet transform, the behavior of which is governed by the choice of filters. In fact, the a trous algorithm is more properly viewed as a nonorthonormal multiresolution algorithm for which the discrete wavelet transform is exact. Moreover, it is shown that the commonly used Lagrange a trous filters are in one-to-one correspondence with the convolutional squares of the Daubechies filters for orthonormal wavelets of compact support. A systematic framework for the discrete wavelet transform is provided, and conditions are derived under which it computes the continuous wavelet transform exactly. Suitable filter constraints for finite energy and boundedness of the discrete transform are also derived. Relevant signal processing parameters are examined, and it is observed that orthonormality is balanced by restrictions on resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.157290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.157290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4076/00157290.pdf","startPage":"2464","endPage":"2482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The discrete wavelet transform: wedding the a trous and Mallat algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"The discrete wavelet transform: wedding the a trous and Mallat algorithms","volume":"40","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4295606","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/157290/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The discrete wavelet transform: wedding the a trous and Mallat algorithms","sourcePdf":"00157290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046592S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1129","articleId":"157290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":157292,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The geometry of the cross terms is described by deriving mathematical expressions for the energy distributions of the STFT and the WT of a multicomponent signal. From those mathematical expressions it is inferred that the STFT and the WT cross terms: (1) occur at the intersection of the respective transforms of the two signals under consideration, whereas the WD cross terms occur at mid-time-frequency of the two signals; (2) are oscillatory in nature, as are the WD cross terms, and are modulated by a cosine whose argument is a function of the difference in center times and center frequencies of the signals under consideration; and (3) can have a maximum amplitude as large as twice the product of the magnitude of the transforms of the two signals in question, like WD cross terms. It is shown that the presence of these cross terms could lead to problems in analyzing a multicomponent signal.

The analysis is based on the second-order Taylor series expansion of the derivative of the null spectrum, properties of the null spectrum, and statistics of the estimated signal eigenvectors. It is proven that in the derivation the remainder term in the second-order Taylor series can be dropped but the second-order terms cannot be. Simulations verify that the bias expression is valid over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) extending down into the resolution threshold region of MUSIC. Although asymptotic, this expression can be accurately applied to a limited number of snapshot cases. The utility of the expression is shown by using it in a study of MUSIC location estimator characteristics. Estimate bias and standard deviation are compared for variations in SNR, numbers of sensors and snapshots, and source correlation.

It is shown how the mean field theory from statistical mechanics can be used to calculate the conditional expectations for these problems efficiently. The efficacy of the mean field theory approach is demonstrated on parameter estimation for one-dimensional mixture data and two-dimensional unsupervised stochastic model-based image segmentation. Experimental results indicate that in the 1-D case, the mean field theory approach provides results comparable to those obtained by Baum's (1987) algorithm, which is known to be optimal. In the 2-D case, where Baum's algorithm can no longer be used, the mean field theory provides good parameter estimates and image segmentation for both synthetic and real-world images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.157297","startPage":"2570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4076/00157297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.157297","endPage":"2583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The mean field theory in EM procedures for Markov random fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/157297/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"The mean field theory in EM procedures for Markov random fields","volume":"40","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4289863","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The mean field theory in EM procedures for Markov random fields","sourcePdf":"00157297.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073867S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"238","articleId":"157297","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":157307,"authors":[{"name":"D.-L.

The real and imaginary parts of this signal are a linear combination of the original signal and of its complete and partial Hilbert transforms. Its Fourier image exists only in one orthant of the multidimensional frequency space. The orthant is a half-axis in one dimension, a quadrant in two dimensions, an octant in three dimensions, etc. A multidimensional complex signal makes it possible to introduce the definitions of instantaneous amplitude, instantaneous phase, and partial instantaneous complex frequencies (partial derivatives of the instantaneous phase) and to formulate a modulation theory of a multidimensional harmonic carrier. The 2-D equivalent of 1-D single-sideband modulation is defined and called single quadrant modulation. It is shown that the multidimensional complex signal with a signal orthant spectrum may be defined as a convolution of the real signal with the multidimensional complex delta distribution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.158601","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/4083/00158601.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.158601","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1287","endPage":"1300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional complex signals with single-orthant spectra","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=158601","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional complex signals with single-orthant spectra","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/158601/","volume":"80","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4285229","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional complex signals with single-orthant spectra","sourcePdf":"00158601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059442S","chronDate":"Aug.  1992","isNumber":"4083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"114","articleId":"158601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":158603,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

The technique is based on C-V measurements between the gate and source/drain at two different back-gate voltages, and only a large-area transistor is required. Using this technique, SOI film thickness mapping was made on a finished SIMOX wafer and a thickness variation of +or-150 AA was found. This thickness variation causes as much as a 100-mV variation in the device threshold voltage. The silicon-film thickness variation and threshold-voltage variation across a wafer shows a linear correlation dependence for a fully depleted device. C-V measurements of the back-gate device yield the buried-oxide thickness and parasitic capacitances.

These measurements show the existence of three distinct regions in the noise spectra: a 1/f noise line shape, a Lorentzian spectrum (noise 'bump'), and a white-noise region. The 1/f noise is attributed to fluctuations in the extrinsic-base surface recombination current. The noise bump is generated by an AlGaAs trap in the emitter-base junction. The DX center was identified as a possible candidate for this trap. It is shown that for 4- mu m*10- mu m emitter AlGaAs/GaAs HBTs, the use of a depleted, AlGaAs passivation ledge over the extrinsic-base surface typically reduced the 1/f base noise current by a factor of 10, and the reduction of the Al mole fraction from 0.3 to 0.2 decreased the magnitude of the noise bump by a factor of 3.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.158813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4087","startPage":"2383","endPage":"2394","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/4087/00158813.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-frequency noise properties of N-p-n AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/158813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-frequency noise properties of N-p-n AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4288035","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-frequency noise properties of N-p-n AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"00158813.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087266S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"94","articleId":"158813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":158815,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Measurements of the local RF field show gain consistent with that of the amplifier. The highly cycloidal nature of the electron beam used in the device has helped elucidate the wave-electron interaction during amplification. With high RF power levels the cycloidal nature of the electron beam is distorted as the beam smooths out. These density measurements have been directly compared to a numerical simulation that gives reasonable prediction of the measured results.

Classes of polarimetric backscatter are selected on the basis of a multidimensional fuzzy clustering of the logarithm of the parameters composing the polarimetric covariance matrix. The clustering procedure uses both polarimetric amplitude and phase information, is adapted to the presence of image speckle, and does not require an arbitrary weighting of the different polarimetric channels; it also provides a partitioning of each data sample used for clustering into multiple clusters. Given the classes of polarimetric backscatter, the entire image is classified using a maximum a posteriori polarimetric classifier. Four-look polarimetric SAR complex data of lava flows and of sea ice acquired by the NASA/JPL airborne polarimetric radar (AIRSAR) are segmented using this technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/4089/00158863.pdf","startPage":"697","endPage":"705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.158863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.158863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4089","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=158863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised segmentation of polarimetric SAR data using the covariance matrix","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backscatter","Synthetic aperture radar","Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar","Microwave theory and techniques","Multidimensional systems","Covariance matrix","Speckle","Sea ice","NASA","Airborne radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","image segmentation","microwave imaging","polarimetry","remote sensing by radar","speckle","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land surface imaging","geophysics","remote sensing","measurement","technique","synthetic aperture radar","ocean","SAR","covariance matrix","method","unsupervised segmentation","homogeneous microwave polarimetric backscatter characteristics","multidimensional fuzzy clustering","amplitude","phase information","image speckle","a posteriori polarimetric classifier","sea ice"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/158863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised segmentation of polarimetric SAR data using the covariance matrix","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4299580","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised segmentation of polarimetric SAR data using the covariance matrix","sourcePdf":"00158863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058902S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"4089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"72","articleId":"158863","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":158864,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The real-time subaperture algorithm is based on an approximation of the phase history correction in each subaperture with a simple linear correction, which can be carried out by an up/down-conversion of the received signal followed by a moving average operation. The characteristics of the impulse response function are improved considerably by means of a frequency overlap of the subapertures and become comparable to a conventional matched filter response.

The canopy is modeled as a two-layered medium above a rough interface. The upper layer is the crown, containing leaves, stems, and branches. The lower layer is the trunk region, modeled as randomly positioned cylinders with a preferred orientation distribution above an irregular soil surface.

The technique requires the acquisition of two images of the same object with altered gradients. On the basis of a knowledge of these gradients it employs an automatic postprocessing step that exploits some invariant characteristics of the distortions to produce a rectified image from the two acquired images. No phantom imaging is involved and no operator interaction is required. The technique is theoretically justified and compared to other techniques, and experimental results that show that the technique works are presented. The improved accuracy in geometry and intensity may improve reliability of stereotactic surgery, may enhance the feasibility of both clinical and industrial imaging via external fields, and may increase the resolution of microscopic imaging.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/4091/00158935.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.158935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.158935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=158935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A technique for accurate magnetic resonance imaging in the presence of field inhomogeneities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Imaging phantoms","High-resolution imaging","Microscopy","Nonuniform electric fields","Magnetostatics","Surgery","Image resolution","Magnetic resonance","Magnetization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical NMR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accurate magnetic resonance imaging technique","medical diagnostic imaging","clinical imaging","undistorted intensity","static field inhomogeneity","automatic postprocessing step","rectified image","phantom imaging","operator interaction","stereotactic surgery","industrial imaging","microscopic imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/158935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","displayDocTitle":"A technique for accurate magnetic resonance imaging in the presence of field inhomogeneities","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4293828","pubMedId":"18222873","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A technique for accurate magnetic resonance imaging in the presence of field inhomogeneities","sourcePdf":"00158935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06269S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"310","articleId":"158935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":158943,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The system has been used to observe the regional kinetics of positron-emitting radionuclides in the rat brain and the human radial artery. Designs for a small diameter, no-septa tomograph incorporating these detectors have been considered. Simulations demonstrate the possibilities of following tracer uptake within the rat brain and radial artery.

This network is self-routing, in the sense that there is a simple distributed routing algorithm which guarantees optimal paths between any pair of vertices. This fact, together with other properties such as regularity, symmetry, high connectivity, and a simple recursive structure, suggests that the crossed cube may be an attractive alternative to the ordinary hypercube for massively parallel architectures, SIMD algorithms, which utilize the architecture are developed, and it is shown that the CQ/sub n/ architecture can profitably emulate the ordinary hypercube. It is also shown that addition of simple switches can improve the capabilities of the system significantly. For instance, the dynamic reconfiguration capability allows hypercube algorithms to be executed on the proposed architecture.

In prior work, it has been suggested that the hardware needed to execute code with branches optimally is exponentially dependent on the total number of dynamic branches executed, this number of branches being proportional at least to the number of iterations of the loop. For classes of code taking at least one cycle per iteration to execute, this is not the case. For loops containing one test (normally in the form of a Boolean recurrence of order one), it is shown that the hardware necessary varies from exponential to polynomial in the length of the dependence cycle L, while execution time varies from one time cycle per iteration to less than L time cycles per iteration; the variation depends on specific code dependences. These results bring the eager evaluation of imperative code closer to fruition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Hardware","Optimal control","Supercomputers","Concurrent computing","Parallel machines","Application software","Computer science","Timing","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loop iterations","loops with tests","branch intensive code","dynamic branches","Boolean recurrence","order one","dependence cycle","time cycle","imperative code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=159040","doi":"10.1109/71.159040","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/4096/00159040.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.159040","startPage":"573","endPage":"581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4096","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Requirements for optimal execution of loops with tests","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Requirements for optimal execution of loops with tests","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4289769","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Requirements for optimal execution of loops with tests","sourcePdf":"00159040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037689S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"8","articleId":"159040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":159043,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The n-rotator graphs are defined as a subset of all rotator graphs. The distribution of distances of vertices in the n-rotator graphs is presented, and the average distance between vertices is found.

Initial clinical results are presented on normal volunteers and selected patients with brain tumors surrounded by edema. Supervised and unsupervised segmentation techniques provide broadly similar results. Unsupervised fuzzy algorithms were visually observed to show better segmentation when compared with raw image data for volunteer studies. For a more complex segmentation problem with tumor/edema or cerebrospinal fluid boundary, where the tissues have similar MR relaxation behavior, inconsistency in rating among experts was observed, with fuzz-c-means approaches being slightly preferred over feedforward cascade correlation results.

Four classes of simulation illustrated fuzzy ARTMAP performance in relation to benchmark backpropagation and generic algorithm systems. These simulations include finding points inside versus outside a circle, learning to tell two spirals apart, incremental approximation of a piecewise-continuous function, and a letter recognition database.

It is shown that: the generalized approximate-reasoning-based intelligent control (GARIC) architecture learns and tunes a fuzzy logic controller even when only weak reinforcement, such as a binary failure signal, is available; introduces a new conjunction operator in computing the rule strengths of fuzzy control rules; introduces a new localized mean of maximum (LMOM) method in combining the conclusions of several firing control rules; and learns to produce real-valued control actions. Learning is achieved by integrating fuzzy inference into a feedforward network, which can then adaptively improve performance by using gradient descent methods. The GARIC architecture is applied to a cart-pole balancing system and demonstrates significant improvements in terms of the speed of learning and robustness to changes in the dynamic system's parameters over previous schemes for cart-pole balancing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/4097/00159061.pdf","startPage":"724","endPage":"740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.159061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.159061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=159061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning and tuning fuzzy logic controllers through reinforcements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Supervised learning","Automatic control","Control systems","Fuzzy control","Humans","Vehicle dynamics","Computer architecture","Analytical models","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","fuzzy logic","inference mechanisms","learning systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement learning","learning systems","artificial intelligence","fuzzy logic controllers","tuning","dynamic system","generalized approximate-reasoning-based intelligent control","GARIC","localized mean of maximum","real-valued control actions","fuzzy inference","feedforward network","cart-pole balancing system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Learning and tuning fuzzy logic controllers through reinforcements","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4301325","pubMedId":"18276471","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning and tuning fuzzy logic controllers through reinforcements","sourcePdf":"00159061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0318S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"639","articleId":"159061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":159063,"authors":[{"name":"H.

NARA is a neural network (NN) based on the structure of fuzzy inference rules. The distinctive feature of NARA is that its internal state can be analyzed according to the rule structure, and the problematic portion can be easily located and improved. The ease with which performance can be improved is shown by applying the NARA model to pattern classification problems. The NARA model is shown to be more efficient than ordinary NN models. In NARA, characteristics of the application task can be built into the NN model in advance by employing the logic structure, in the form of fuzzy inference rules. Therefore, it is easier to improve the performance of NARA, in which the internal state can be observed because of its structure, than that of an ordinary NN model, which is like a black box. Examples are introduced by applying the NARA model to the problems of auto adjustment of VTR tape running mechanisms and alphanumeric character recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.159063","startPage":"752","endPage":"760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.159063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/4097/00159063.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks designed on approximate reasoning architecture and their applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159063/","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks designed on approximate reasoning architecture and their applications","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4301327","pubMedId":"18276473","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks designed on approximate reasoning architecture and their applications","sourcePdf":"00159063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076042S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"113","articleId":"159063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":159065,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Based on the fuzzy basis function representations, an orthogonal least-squares (OLS) learning algorithm is developed for designing fuzzy systems based on given input-output pairs; then, the OLS algorithm is used to select significant fuzzy basis functions which are used to construct the final fuzzy system.

Three direct-axis and four quadrature-axis models are categorized, along with the basic transient reactance model. Some of the assumptions made in using various models, including the basic model, are discussed, and the fundamental equations and concepts involved in generator/system interfacing are presented. The various attributes of power system stability are covered in a general way, with two basic approaches being recognized. The first is categorized under large-disturbance nonlinear analysis. The second approach considers small disturbances, where the corresponding dynamic equations are linearized. Applications of a range of generator models are discussed and treated. The manner in which generator saturation is treated in stability studies, both in the initialization process, as well as during large or small disturbance stability analysis procedures is addressed. Saturation functions that are derived either from test data or by the methods of finite elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating values of excitation and internal power angle, depending upon generator terminal conditions, are compared. The question of parameter determination is thoroughly covered. Two approaches in accounting for generator field and excitation system base quantities are identified. Conversion factors are given for transferring field parameters from one base to another for correct generator/excitation system interface modeling. Suggestions for modeling of negative field currents and other field circuit discontinuities are included.","doi":"10.1109/IEEESTD.1991.101073","startPage":"1","endPage":"96","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Std 1110-1991","pdfPath":"/iel1/2939/4158/00159388.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Std 1110-1991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.1991.101073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1110-1991 - IEEE Guide for Synchronous Generator Modeling Practices in Stability Analyses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Stability","Synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine theory","power systems","stability","synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine theory","IEEE guide","synchronous generator models","power system stability","three direct axis","quadrature axis","transient reactance","generator/system interfacing","large disturbance nonlinear analysis","dynamic equations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["models","application","analyses","Synchronous generator stability","Stability data determination","Saturation practices","Modeling practices"]}],"versions":[{"evolutions":[{"description":"Superseded by ","title":"IEEE Std 1110-2002 (Revision of IEEE Std 1110-1991)","displayLink":"pubLink","pubNumber":8867}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 18 1991","displayDocTitle":"1110-1991 - IEEE Guide for Synchronous Generator Modeling Practices in Stability Analyses","isStandard":true,"standardNumber":"1110-1991","publicationDate":"18 Nov. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4086357","xploreDocumentType":"Standard","openAccessFlag":"F","icsCodes":[{"code":"29.160.20","term":"Generators"}],"title":"IEEE Guide for Synchronous Generator Modeling Practices in Stability Analyses","sourcePdf":"1110-1991.pdf","content_type":"Standards","mlTime":"PT0.20697S","chronDate":"Nov. 18 1991","xplore-pub-id":"2939","isNumber":"4158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"standards","publicationNumber":"2939","citationCount":"11","articleId":"159388","contentTypeDisplay":"Standards","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"Standard Docs","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07","status":"superseded"},{"_id":159502,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The authors have developed a model and derived analytical expressions for the modulation response, resonance frequency, damping rate, and K factor to include these effects. They show theoretically and experimentally that carrier transport can lead to significant low-frequency parasitic-like rolloff that reduces the modulation response by as much as a factor of six in quantum-well lasers. They also show that, in addition, it leads to a reduction in the effective differential gain and thus the resonance frequency, while the nonlinear gain compression factor remains largely unaffected by it. The authors present the temperature dependence data for the K factor as further evidence for the effects of carrier transport.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/4179/00159508.pdf","startPage":"1990","endPage":"2008","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.159508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.159508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=159508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High speed quantum-well lasers and carrier transport effects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum well lasers","Damping","Resonance","Resonant frequency","Bandwidth","Laser noise","Laser modes","Semiconductor lasers","Differential equations","Charge carrier density"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor lasers","semiconductor quantum wells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transport effects","high-speed properties","quantum-well lasers","model","analytical expressions","modulation response","resonance frequency","damping rate","K factor","low-frequency parasitic-like rolloff","effective differential gain","nonlinear gain compression factor","temperature dependence data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"High speed quantum-well lasers and carrier transport effects","volume":"28","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4288127","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High speed quantum-well lasers and carrier transport effects","sourcePdf":"00159508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076843S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"335","articleId":"159508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":159516,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

This technique is then applied to the determination of the exact pulse shape of a 21-fs compressed continuum at 770 nm using, as a reference, the initial fundamental 65-fs pulse at 620 nm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtosecond pulse phase measurement by spectrally resolved up-conversion: application to continuum compression","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.159535","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/4179/00159535.pdf","startPage":"2285","endPage":"2290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.159535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=159535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Femtosecond pulse phase measurement by spectrally resolved up-conversion: application to continuum compression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4288153","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtosecond pulse phase measurement by spectrally resolved up-conversion: application to continuum compression","sourcePdf":"00159535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075212S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"40","articleId":"159535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":159545,"authors":[{"name":"D. von der Linde","affiliation":["Institut fur Laser und Plasmaphysik, Universit\u00e4t-GHS-Essen, Essen, Germany"],"firstName":"D.","lastName":"von der Linde","id":"37274346500"},{"name":"H.

A relatively intense, well-collimated second harmonic could be observed in the specular direction. The conversion efficiency reached 10/sup -4/ for focused intensities around 10/sup 16/ W/cm/sup 2/. Detailed measurements of the angular dependence, the polarization properties, and the second-harmonic frequency spectra were performed. Time-resolved pump-probe experiments revealed interesting information about the dynamics of the plasmas.

This capability permits the modeling of both linear and nonlinear instantaneous and dispersive effects in the electric polarization in material media. The modeling of the optical carrier is retained. The fundamental innovation is to notice that it is possible to treat the linear and nonlinear convolution integrals, which describe the dispersion, as new dependent variables. A coupled system of nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equations can then be derived for the linear and nonlinear convolution integrals, by differentiating them in the time domain. These equations, together with Maxwell's equations, are solved to determine the electromagnetic fields in nonlinear dispersive media. Results are presented of calculations in one dimension of the propagation and collision of femtosecond electromagnetic solitons that retain the optical carrier, taking into account the Kerr and Raman interactions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.159548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/4179/00159548.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.159548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4179","startPage":"2416","endPage":"2422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational modeling of femtosecond optical solitons from Maxwell's equations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=159548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Computational modeling of femtosecond optical solitons from Maxwell's equations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4288166","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational modeling of femtosecond optical solitons from Maxwell's equations","sourcePdf":"00159548.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053998S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"118","articleId":"159548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":159553,"authors":[{"name":"S.

GaAs and In/sub 0.52/Al/sub 0.48/As grown at temperatures of 200 and 150 degrees C, respectively, exhibited subpicosecond carrier lifetimes, while lattice-mismatched In/sub x/Ga/sub 1-x/As on GaAs displayed a 7-ps carrier lifetime in material grown at 200 degrees C. A distinct decrease in carrier lifetime with decreasing growth temperature is documented for all three material systems. For epilayers annealed at high-temperature, resistivities are high, and thus these materials were found to be ideally suited for a number of ultrafast optoelectronic applications.

Middleton et al. (ibid., vol.33, no.1, p.50-8, Jan. 1988) is reexamined in a broader context. To demonstrate its utility, the algorithm is applied to various families of identifier-based parameterized controllers of both the direct and indirect control types. Application to the direct control type results in a model reference adaptive controller capable of stabilizing, without excitation, any SISO process which can be modeled by a minimum phase linear system whose transfer function has relative and McMillan degrees not exceeding prescribing integers m and n, respectively. It is shown that such processes can also be adaptively stabilized with indirect adaptive controllers and hysteresis switching. A simple numerical example involving a non-minimum-phase process model is used to illustrate how hysteresis switching might be applied to implicitly tuned parameterized controllers to realize an adaptive controller with capabilities which might prove very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve without hysteresis switching or some other form of discontinuous control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1354","doi":"10.1109/9.159571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.159571","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/4180/00159571.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of hysteresis switching in parameter adaptive control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Applications of hysteresis switching in parameter adaptive control","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4287928","volume":"37","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of hysteresis switching in parameter adaptive control","sourcePdf":"00159571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03256S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"277","articleId":"159571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":159580,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The resulting electrooptic signal shows a resonant behavior as a function of wavelength or substrate thickness.

These features include a wideband microstrip-to-slot balun and a wideband active isolator the function of which is to reduce the local oscillator to RF leakage from the input port of the sampler. The signal-to-noise ratio over the input bandwidth is greater than 20 dB at an input power level of -32 dBm. This signal-to-noise ratio was measured in an IF bandwidth of 175 MHz and includes the contribution from the IF amplifier. The sampler, which is made on alumina using MIC techniques, has an integrated impulse generator driven with a sinusoidal local oscillator of only 20 dBm over the frequency band of 250-350 MHz. The IF signal is in the 10-175-MHz band. The RF input VSWR is better than 2:1 up to 20 GHz, and the oscillator to RF breakthrough is better than -58 dBm (-78 dBc) when driven with a local oscillator of 20 dBm.

Structural perfection was improved by alloying with ZnTe to form crystals of Cd/sub 1-x/Zn/sub x/Te. Crystals were grown by a high-pressure Bridgman method. Evidence for significant enhancements of the mu tau products resulting from these efforts is presented. Features of Cd/sub 0.8/Zn/sub 0.2/Te detectors include: energy resolutions at 122 keV<7%; resistivity approximately 10/sup 11/ ohm-cm; no polarization effects: and temperature for useful operation up to 100 degrees C. The large sizes and excellent homogeneity of the crystals make it possible to produce detectors and imaging arrays with areas of several square inches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159673/","volume":"39","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4306130","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cd/sub 1-x/Zn/sub x/Te gamma ray detectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cd/sub 1-x/Zn/sub x/Te gamma ray detectors","sourcePdf":"00159673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027308S","chronDate":"Aug.  1992","isNumber":"4183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"141","articleId":"159673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":159682,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The effect of acquiring an additional set of coincidence planes with a plane separation of +or-2 was studied and showed a reduction in noise and improved uniformity without a significant loss in resolution. The effect of different sampling schemes were also studied. Using a continuous sampling scheme by moving the bed in steps equal to half the plane separation resulted in better image uniformity and a reduction in noise in comparison with images acquired using the standard interleaved sampling mode.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Whole-body PET","Noise level","Image sampling","Detectors","Tomography","Noise reduction","Nuclear medicine","Biomedical imaging","Noise figure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","radioisotope scanning and imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["whole-body positron emission tomography","image quality","detection efficiency","coincidence plane combinations","resolution","continuous sampling scheme","interleaved sampling mode"]}],"doi":"10.1109/23.159763","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/4183/00159763.pdf","startPage":"1079","endPage":"1083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.159763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methods for improving image quality in whole body PET scanning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=159763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Methods for improving image quality in whole body PET scanning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159763/","volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4312388","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods for improving image quality in whole body PET scanning","sourcePdf":"00159763.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038485S","chronDate":"Aug.  1992","isNumber":"4183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"33","articleId":"159763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":159770,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method models an image as a finite mixture. Each mixture component corresponds to an image class. Each image class is characterized by parameters, such as the intensity mean, the standard deviation, and the number of image pixels in that class. The method uses a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to estimate the parameters of each class and employs information criteria of Akaike (AIC) and/or Schwarz and Rissanen (MDL) to determine the number of classes in the image. In computing the ML solution of the mixture, the method adopts the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The initial estimation and convergence of the ML-EM algorithm were studied. The accuracy in determining the number of image classes using AIC and MDL is compared. The MDL criterion performed better than the AIC criterion. A modified MDL showed further improvement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.159772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4183","startPage":"1126","endPage":"1133","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/4183/00159772.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter estimation of finite mixtures using the EM algorithm and information criteria with application to medical image processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1992","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parameter estimation of finite mixtures using the EM algorithm and information criteria with application to medical image processing","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4312397","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter estimation of finite mixtures using the EM algorithm and information criteria with application to medical image processing","sourcePdf":"00159772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042539S","chronDate":"Aug.  1992","isNumber":"4183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"110","articleId":"159772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":159773,"authors":[{"name":"C.-H.

The transmission and emission data were acquired simultaneously using a multidetector, fan-beam collimated SPECT system with a transmission line source (Tc-99m) precisely aligned at the focal line opposite one of the detectors and of a different energy than the emission source (Tl-201). The contamination of transmission data by the high-energy photopeaks of Tl-201 was removed based on measurements from emission-only acquisition detectors.

These interconnect discontinuities are characterized in terms of general lumped/distributed circuit models which are compatible with CAD simulation tools such as SPICE. The results for the model element values are shown to be consistent with frequency-domain lumped equivalent models for microstrips derived from S-parameter measurements and electromagnetic computations based on the excess inductance and capacitance concepts. The models are also validated by simulating their step response on SPICE and comparing them with the TDR data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.159879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4187","startPage":"497","endPage":"504","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/4187/00159879.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-domain characterization of interconnect discontinuities in high-speed circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Time-domain characterization of interconnect discontinuities in high-speed circuits","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4288307","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain characterization of interconnect discontinuities in high-speed circuits","sourcePdf":"00159879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058643S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"4187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"57","articleId":"159879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":159901,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The proposed calibration procedure consists of two steps: (1) the calibration parameters are estimated using a closed-form solution based on a distribution-free camera model; and (2) the parameters estimated in the first step are improved iteratively through a nonlinear optimization, taking into account camera distortions. According to minimum variance estimation, the objective function to be minimized is the mean-square discrepancy between the observed image points and their inferred image projections computed with the estimated calibration parameters. The authors introduce a type of measure that can be used to directly evaluate the performance of calibration and compare calibrations among different systems. The validity and performance of the calibration procedure are tested with both synthetic data and real images taken by tele- and wide-angle lenses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4288324","volume":"14","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Camera calibration with distortion models and accuracy evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Camera calibration with distortion models and accuracy evaluation","sourcePdf":"00159901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05052S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1114","articleId":"159901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":159993,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is shown that the second smallest eigenvalue of a matrix derived from the netlist gives a provably good approximation of the optimal ratio cut partition cost. It is also demonstrated that fast Lanczos-type methods for the sparse symmetric eigenvalue problem are a robust basis for computing heuristic ratio cuts based on the eigenvector of this second eigenvalue. Effective clustering methods are an immediate by-product of the second eigenvector computation and are very successful on the difficult input classes proposed in the CAD literature. The intersection graph representation of the circuit netlist is considered, as a basis for partitioning, a heuristic based on spectral ratio cut partitioning of the netlist intersection graph is proposed. The partitioning heuristics were tested on industry benchmark suites, and the results were good in terms of both solution quality and runtime. Several types of algorithmic speedups and directions for future work are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159993/","volume":"11","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4298417","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"New spectral methods for ratio cut partitioning and clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New spectral methods for ratio cut partitioning and clustering","sourcePdf":"00159993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034024S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"586","articleId":"159993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":159998,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

The PC-set method analyzes the network, determines the set of potential change times for each net, and generates gate simulations for each potential change. The parallel technique, which is based on the concept of bit-parallel simulation is faster and generates less code than the PC-set method, but it is not amenable to data-parallel simulation of multiple input vectors. Both techniques are based on the well-known levelization algorithm used to generate zero-delay levelized compiled code simulation. Two optimizations of the basic parallel technique are presented, called bit-field trimming and shift elimination. Performance results using the ISCAS 85 benchmarks show a factor-of-four improvement for the PC-set method and a factor-of-ten improvement for the parallel technique. The optimization schemes show an average performance improvement of 47% over the unoptimized simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/159998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4298422","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"11","issue":"9","displayDocTitle":"Two new techniques for unit-delay compiled simulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two new techniques for unit-delay compiled simulation","sourcePdf":"00159998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027035S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"4190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"15","articleId":"159998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"}]
